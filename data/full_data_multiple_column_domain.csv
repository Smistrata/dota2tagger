Have you lost your PC in Auckland?,self.DotA2,Hi DOTA players. I am the IT manager for a shopping centre in Auckland New Zealand. I have been handed a PC that was found in the bushes at work here and even though the CPU and RAM are gone the rest appears to be intact including a GTX 680 vid card case mobo and 1TB hdd. We are assuming that it was stolen not abandoned.  I have gone though the fairly clean hdd and the only piece of identifying info on it was the steam account and the guy plays DOTA and has reddit as a favorite website so I am hoping to catch him here somehow.  I have sent a friend request to his private account and been denied so I am running out of options.  If you recently had your PC stolen and believe you are the guy that owns this hardware can you contact me please?  This is also posted in /r/DOTA as I had no idea where to look.,fluff

Support circle jerk: You are Dazzle.,self.DotA2,"All Pick begins. You ban Axe because you are Dazzle. You chat to your team ""I will support."" You don't care about the rest of the picks because Axe is banned and you are Dazzle. You know you will solo support because it is 1.5k even though there is a Riki on the other team. Your teammates pick their heroes. Sven. Slardar. Obviously Pugna mid. Obviously LC jungle. You load into the game. You buy courier and both wards. You buy tangos and a clarity. You give your mid two tangos because it is 1.5k and you do not want him to feed. You want to win.  You are Dazzle so the laning stage is going well even though you have spent all your money on sentries. Sven has not died yet. You are returning to bottom lane after a rotation when Sven is ganked under enemy T1 tower. ""Report Dazzle no grave"" he writes in all chat. You don't respond because you are Dazzle. You don't acknowledge flame. You make a mental note to skill Shallow Grave next to increase its cast range. You are Dazzle and you have one job. Your job is not tilting or flaming. Your job is winning.  The next carry to die is your offlane Slardar. ""team?"" he types in chat. You do not respond even though you called missing on both bot and middle lanes. You are Dazzle. You also do not mute your team because you are Dazzle and they need you. Even when mid Pugna says in all chat ""this dazzle"" and ""just abandon"" you do not mute him. Pugna isn't having a good game you say to yourself. But you can fix that if you don't tilt. Because you are Dazzle and you want to win.  ""wrads"" says LC after dying in enemy secret shop where a ward had been dewarded just a minute ago. ""wrads"" ""ward"" ""wards"" ""wrad"" ""ward"" Enemy Riki affected by +10 duel damage. You don't flame even though the enemy team is dewarding everything you have with Riki and Zeus and wards are out of stock. It is just 65 gold. 15 minutes into the game you have brown boots magic stick and wards. You look at the energy booster in your quickbuy. 900 gold. You replace it with sentries.  The enemy is taking down your T2 tower in top lane. ""b"" you type in chat. Slardar has muted you already. He turns on Sprint and runs into 4 enemy heroes looking for a solo ultra kill. You do not flame because you are Dazzle. You TP top and Shallow Grave Slardar. The enemy team begins to dive for the kill but it is too late. Slardar is too fast. Your team is TPing in. Warhammer. God's Strength. Weave. Enemy heroes are melting as Weave gets stronger. Duel goes off. LC affected by +10 duel damage. Enemies are dead but Pugna still sucking. Its a team wipe. You don't gloat because you are Dazzle. You know it is still 9-6 in the enemy's favor. You just ping the tower but your carries are already going back into the jungle. You do not flame them because Dazzle likes to win.  LC finally begins to win duels. She almost loses one but you are there for the Shallow Grave. LC says nothing and returns to the jungle. Meanwhile Sven takes down the T2 bot. ""Well Played!"" you say. Pugna is still flaming but you still do not mute him because Dazzle wants to win. ""0-8-11 dazzle"" he types in all chat. ""lmao"" ""arcane boots and wand at 40 min"" ""report"" 45 minutes into the game LC is finally ready to stop farming. ""> Blademail: Ready"" he announces. You do not flame him. You are happy he is ready to fight.   With Shallow Grave LC never loses another duel. You pick up your pipe your first item after Arcanes. Your team goes down middle lane as 5 for the first time. Dazzle is happy. Dazzle likes to be as 5. Sven is bashing into the T3 mid. The enemy team takes the bait. LC blinks in immediate duel win. Affected by +160 duel damage. Weave. God's Strength. Even Nether Ward gets a kill when Zeus ults. Enemy team is wiped again. You notice the flame starting in the other direction now. ""gg"" says the enemy Zeus. ""finish fast"" ""trash Riki"" ""no support""  The enemy mid rax are down. The T4s start to make that delicious crumbling noise. You know the end is near. Ancient is exposed. Enemy begins to respawn so you Weave again. LC walks into enemy fountain but you do not flame. You ping the ancient because you want to win. You Shallow Grave LC when he almost dies from fountain shots. +170 duel damage. The ancient goes down. ""report dazzle"" says Pugna on the post-game screen. ""report dazzle"" agrees Sven. ""1-9-18""   Your heart hurts but you don't respond. Because you are Dazzle and you won. ",fluff

6x Iron Branch should combine to give Iron Tree...,self.DotA2,...which gives 6 to all stats.  Many heroes buy Iron Branch but nobody buys it after earlygame. I think this suggestion will make it a better midgame item because for 300g you can get 6 to all stats which is definitely not too strong especially compared to like bracer which only costs a bit more and gives a bit less.  But then it's still just a 300g item so maybe 6x Ironwood Tree can combine to give Iron Forest which give 36 to all stats for 1800g which is pretty efficient for a midtier item. It's only a bit stronger than Skadi afterall and only costs a bit less.   And 6x Ironwood Tree should combine to give Ironwood Forest 6x of which should give Ironwood Jungle which gives 216 all stats for 10800g which allows it to be a really good lategame item giving barely less HP than 4 Heart and only costs a bit less.  Since it has been confirmed that Kaya + Yasha + Sange as well as Aether Lens + Kaya is definitely a thing next patch I think Iron Branch needs some love too.^kappa^kappa^flair^checks^out^it's^a^trap,fluff
Defense of the Ancients 2 is my favorite video game.,self.DotA2,Defense of the Ancients 2 is my favorite video game. It is a free-to-play game created and maintained by the Valve Corporation which is headquartered in Bellevue Washington and ruled by the legendary Gabe Logan Newell. Defense of the Ancients 2 (DotA2) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) in which each of ten players (two teams of five players each) take control of ten heroes to do battle and fulfill objectives on a roughly-symmetrical playing field. The game is routinely praised for being unforgivingly strategic and nearly impossible to master. Players seeking any level of success must be nimble of hand cunning of mind and perhaps most importantly completely void of human emotion: when two warriors lock eyes on the battlefield be they the armorclad Dragon Knight the enigmatic Juggernaut the unrelenting Bloodseeker or the mischievous faerie-dragon Puck all mercy must be put aside. The best teams do not only destroy their opponents though that is an important part: the best teams humiliate their enemies casting them down like broken-winged birds into the losers pit of shame amidst an unceasing stream of ridicule and scorn. In a sense it is not a battle of heroes: it is a battle of egos where the most resilient emerges the victor.   I having accrued nearly two thousand matchmaking points am unusually good and with my signature hero the Sniper I have sown violence and death across thousands of battlefields. Regarding items I start with a Butterfly. Providing massive bonuses to agility attack speed and evasion it is by a wide margin the best item in the game. I usually stay mid lane and farm gold until I finish it typically around minute 40 at which point I will start roaming and ganking. After netting a few kills I will purchase Mask of Madness to improve my attack speed and mobility. Some people prefer Boots of Speed as their mobility item but in my opinion only the dimmest of dimwits rely on passive effects: a truly skilled player (like me) can utilize active effects to greater result. Not to mention the Boots of Speed have no offensive capabilities whatsoeverneither attack damage attack speed or agility. One could argue that the upgraded Boots of Speed (called Power Treads) remedies this problem but I would counter-argue that the passive 30 increased attack speed granted by the Power Treads pales in comparison to the Mask of Madnesss active attack speed bonus of 100. It is painfully obvious which is betteryet still I am routinely disappointed by just how many players refuse to buy the Mask of Madness. Passive effects are the bane of my online existence.,fluff

Hey everyone this is The Dota dev team from the year 2046 and I'm here to answer your Dota 2 questions before you ask them,self.DotA2,We've had a fantastic 3 decades here at Valve and to celebrate 33 years of Dota the development team decided to send me back in time to answer your questions about the future of the game. Now as a side effect of breaking the space-time continuum my answers will appear before you ask your questions so bear with me. I've also had to commandeer someone else's Reddit account since all of Reddit's original servers were destroyed in the Digital Singularity of 2039. AMA!  EDIT 3: Thanks for all your wonderful questions! I'm sorry I wasn't able to answer all of them but I need to go back to 2046 to work on the new Gambler Arcana ( the cost to pre-order is a random amount based on your multiplier of your average GPM ). Before I go I've got one last round of answers for you. So take care and we'll see you next time.  EDIT 2: Thanks for the amazing and thought provoking questions everyone! Due to the popularity of this AMA I've answered a few more of your questions!

The Chinese Perspective on the 2GD Drama: Why GabeN's hand might have been forced,self.DotA2,"**Warning: Long post ahead**  In the last few days there's been a lot of commentary and speculation on the 2GD drama. One thing that's been missing is the Chinese perspective which I've seen some people ask for but hasn't been provided. I'll try to give an overview (I am currently living in Shanghai).  I think the fact that this controversy happened in China is important to understanding why thing played out the way they did. A lot of what I'm going to say is speculation just because nobody knows all the fact right now. But I don't think most people on /r/dota2 get how different China is even with past drama with Chinese tournaments. There's a thread on the front page right now about ""Chris Rock made memey jokes at the Oscars same thing as 2GD right?"" Completely ignores that one is in USA and one is in China.  I looked on Weibo and Tieba to gauge the average Chinese netizens' reaction to the controversy (one unrelated thing you guys may find interesting that I'd forgotten about the Chinese nickname for GabeN is Fat G). Anyway the most common reaction was ""Who the hell is 2GD"" as you might expect. However the second most common reaction was different variations of **""He was hosting the show and made a sex joke? Serves him right of course he was fired.""**  China's government tightly controls all media in the country and one of the most longstanding rules is the near-complete ban on sexual content and pornography. Basically all porn is blocked on the internet. James's opening joke on the first day was possibly the worst you could think of. Not only did he reference porn and masturbation he talked about circumventing the government internet blocks in order to watch porn. While he was in China. In front of a camera talking into a microphone.  The Shanghai Major is a pretty big deal when I found out they got the Mercedez-Benz Arena for the finals I was actually very surprised. Its where the World Expo was in 2010 and where big international music stars do concerts. It's like Staples Center in LA or Madison Square Garden in NYC. It's bigger than KeyArena by any measure. I remember a huge Taylor Swift concert being held there last year.  So yeah it's a pretty big deal and Valve/Perfect World most likely had to do a LOT of negotiating and utilize a great deal of [guanxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanxi) in order to get this confirmed.   Now imagine Gabe's reaction when he hears about this at Valve HQ. ""James did what??"" Granted as we know Gabe didn't know about Icefrog telling James to be himself which is definitely a breakdown in communications at Valve. But again James made one of the worse jokes you could make basically making a sex joke and subverting the Chinese government joke in the same sentence the moment after Gabe puts him in front of a camera. At this point Gabe didn't yet fire him but he was definitely on two strikes. This is speculation but I'd imagine the ""bottom bitch"" comment was the last straw. Seems pretty innocuous in the USA but it does have sexual connotations.  I want to note at this point that I'm no prude and most (young) Chinese people aren't either. I like James use methods to get around the internet blocks to access certain forbidden sites. But nobody talks about it that's just how the culture is and nobody would dare talk about it in front of a camera. I have a (white American) friend who was an exchange student in China two years ago and he made a minor masturbation joke in his Chinese class at a Beijing university. His teacher a girl who I also know was shocked speechless for 2 minutes. This girl isn't a prude either and goes clubbing on weekends but my point is that in China you just. don't. talk about sex in any sort of ""official"" setting.  In this kind of culture James' actions came across as a boorish ignorant tourist. Except he was a boorish ignorant tourist with a mic in front of a camera. I like James' content and I've been watching GD Studio for a long time. But it was clear that James has no conception of how whats acceptable to say on-air is different in the USA/UK and China.  So Gabe has a decision to make not just for the group stage but the main stage. Group stage was more low-key but I think Gabe ultimately decided he didn't want to run the risk of James making another sex joke while sitting on the main stage in the Mercedes-Benz center. Again this is the biggest entertainment venue in the biggest city in China - I can almost guarantee the Shanghai municipal government officials will be monitoring the Main Event in some way. One more sex joke on the main stage and there's a lot of bad blood between Valve and Chinese officials and Valve's access to a huge chunk of the Dota2 playerbase just got a helluva lot more difficult.   James' ""bottom bitch"" comment was probably interpreted by Gabe as ""well either he didn't get my NO MORE SEX JOKES message or he's intentionally defying it"" and led to the ""James is an ass"" comment. For the record I'm not saying I agree with Gabe's comment but I'm trying to explain (as much for myself as for anybody else) what might have led to that comment.  Thanks for reading and I welcome any comments especially from any other Chinese people who might be browsing this sub see if I missed anything.  **EDIT**: To address one of the most common comments on this thread - Yeah hosting a major in China definitely brings a shit ton of problems. I'm not going to make a judgment on whether Valve should or shouldn't have one in China in the future. It was definitely Valve's fault in regard to the Icefrog miscommunication and not prepping James beforehand. However I will also say that IMO last year's DAC was a pretty successful large-scale tournament in China and as many people have said Valve probably hoped the Shanghai Major would basically be DAC but even better. That obviously hasn't happened with the KeyTV P R O D U C T I O N V A L U E + 2GD Drama  **EDIT 2: REGARDING THE ""NOBODY IN CHINA EVEN WATCHES ENGLISH STREAM WTF"" ARGUMENT:**  I acknowledged that most Chinese dota watchers don't watch English stream and don't know who 2GD is. However there are those who do and some of those who do post the news on social media sites just like how people find out news about Burning rotK LaNm xiao8 here on /r/dota2. Would probably not be a good look for Valve in China if even a few Chinese social media sites started talking about a Valve host making dirty jokes in the Benz arena. ",fluff

Feels. Good. Man.,self.DotA2,In my last game I met a guy that 5th picked lifestealer and demanded safelane even though terrorblade was already there. I even tried to convince him to jungle so he can afk farm and not bother the rest of the team but I was only met with what seemed like a preteen boy yelling at me in an arabic language with a 140 decibel fan on the background.  My worst fears come true he selects the courier and his hero and starts walking towards the mid lane loudly announcing in all chat that he will provide sustenance to the enemy team. I beg him not to but it doesn't help he's closing in on the river. Until suddenly...  He stops.  His hero and the courier are frozen.  I try to move the courier back to base and it seems to work he doesn't try to yank it back to mid. And then those magic words appear on screen.      **Lifestealer has disconnected from the game.**   **Lifestealer has 5 minutes to reconnect.**      His hero starts walking back to fountain.  Five minutes pass the game will not be counted stats and MMR will not be updated. And while he got an abandon me and my former teammates agreed to report him for intentional feeding.  As I return to the main menu I am informed that action has been taken against him.  Thank you GabeN. For looking over me in my darkest hours.,fluff

Sun Strike delay,self.DotA2,There are 24 hours in a day/night cycle (= 86 400 seconds). In dota that is 8 minutes (= 480 seconds). Therefore 1 second in dota equals 180 seconds in real life. It takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds for sunlight to go from the Sun to the Earth. That is 500 seconds in reality which is 2.77 seconds in dota time. However sunstrike delay is 1.7 seconds in dota time. For Venus it would take 2 seconds dota time and for Mercury a bit above 1 second dota time. Therefore the dota universe is situated somewhere between Mercury and Venus or fix delay.,fluff

You don't deserve DotA,self.DotA2,"All these entitled whiny punks on reddit don't know how great this game is. Always complaining about the lack of content and how delayed battlepass arcana or some other bullshit is. People on here daily saying that the game is boring and there's nothing to do. What the fuck are you expecting to do other than play dota? Why are you starting up dota to jerk your dick to a new crystal maiden skin? If you want to do quests go play WoW. The happiest these fucks have been in the last year is when you could see QoPs tits take up half the fucking screen on your profile page. Why are you even playing this game?  Like seriously I cringe every time I read something like ""there isn't anything to do in this game anymore that's why it's dying"". Just the other day I was down at the local bball court and people were like ""man there's nothing to do here anymore I need some incentive to play pickup games."" Nah just kidding that didn't happen they're there to play fucking basketball not whine about how nike announced that they'd release a michael jordan arcana 204 days ago. They're there to ball blow off steam fucking school some kids.  That's the same reason 95% of us play dota. We just wanna style on some mother fuckers pull off some cool moves and get completely absorbed in a fun ass game. Balance changes don't affect us much at all. 99% of you bitches will continue to do the exact same things you did before a patch with zero thought as to how it impacts your ability to win. Yet you go on reddit like you're some fucking godlike analyst saying how we have shit patches and balance changes that make no sense. None of you have any fucking clue what you're talking about.  Back in my day you had to install a third party program to fake a lan game just to get something that resembled a decent match. And even then you'd get a leaver like 25% of the time. But you know what we put up with it. Because we loved playing dota. Now all people want is for Valve to cash in on the community's creation and waste time on shit like cosmetics and quests. Yeah fuck that. Go play league if you want to shell out 10% of your measly peon income every month for cartoon tits and cringy cosmetics. The rest of us will be enjoying the masterpiece that is dota 2.  So please kindly fuck off with your asinine suggestions and stop asking for things that are at best tangential to the dota experience and at worst detrimental to its core. Go to an art museum if you want some cosmetics. Get a job if you want some quests. Play dota if you want to play some fucking dota. I know that's what I'll be doing.  ",personal
7.00 is killing my custom game and I can't do anything about it,self.DotA2,I've put a lot of work into my game: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=473718711  Over more than a year I've developed a unique ranked system rewards system custom game pass system and now it's all going to the trash bin because after 7.00 90% of players experience a crash after the game ends. Which means they will never see their rank progression or their custom game pass level progression.  I know only a week has passed but I'm losing players every day and you know what happens to games with no players: they die.  Players also report frequent crashes on selecting units (which I have never messed with) or even simply going to dashboard and back. And since the game is so short players never come back to play another one after a crash.  It's disheartening to see my creation die while being absolutely helpless.  EDIT: to any of you people telling me to fix it myself I've recorded a little footage just now. I've been trying to locate the bug for the last 20 hours and there it is: https://my.mixtape.moe/xacebu.webm  As far as I've got it trying to load any 3D model into UI (in this case monkey king preview from dashboard) at this point will make the game crash. I have a ton of 3D models in the UI before but they do not crash the game. There are specific preconditions which I don't understand and which I seemingly can't fix. It also seems like that can happen earlier in the game.,personal

Thank You,self.DotA2,Just wanted to write a small bit expressing my gratitude to everyone especially Valve for letting me participate in the main stage of this years TI.  The last two years have been a bit of a slump for me in terms of casting and overall mentality I appreciate those of you who stuck with me through it to get me here.

Got angry at a nice guy in chat realized something pretty heavy.,self.DotA2,"Basically we were getting stomped. Nice guy we'll call Frak was doing poorly. So was I. I was 0-7 him 1-6. Basically I die a couple times in lane with him him as Bane me as Drow.  I get pissed off in chat and talk down to him insult him generally I just act like an angry douchebag. He never responds back he either stays silent or just says ""Sorry"" or similar stuff. Soon I stop trash talking him. I calm down in about 3 or 4 minutes.   As our last towers got smashed down by their team I felt awful for what I said. I got angry and stupid because I was losing. He was actually doing better than me and my deaths were my fault. And I dragged a nice person through the dirt for it. I go into chat and say ""Bane I'm really sorry for what I said. I'm doing worse than you and I had no place to say what I said. You're doing better and I'm really sorry.""  He says ""It's okay man. I'd be angry too."" I'm glad he's accepted my apology. I say ""Thanks for not being like me"". Then it hit me that I just typed that. I was relieved and thankful that someone was behaving other than how *I* behave.   I actually stopped playing for a few seconds when it hit me. I was toxic and generally a bad player sometimes I was *that* player. I said sorry again and he was fine with it. We lost the game me and him exchanging ""gg""'s and ""nice jobs""'s.   I'm going to stop getting angry now. I need to behave nicely and treat other players how I'd like to be treated. I'd just like to share this with you guys as it really opened my eyes. ",personal
My girlfriend and I met in a dota pub 2 years ago today...,self.DotA2,She picked offlane OD and I was safelane DK with my friend supporting me (it was 2k mmr). Having identified she was a grill I proceeded to capslock flame her all game and suicide to the enemy fountain to prove my devotion to her. Somehow it worked and we added each other. A month later I was on the plane from the UK to Romania to meet her. 4 months later we went to Fiji together for 2 weeks. 6 months later she moved to England got a job and we have lived together for over a year now. We still play dotes and tonight will play offlane OD and safelane DK in a pub to celebrate. Though now we are over 4k mmr I think that won't end well...  Tonight 2 years and +2000 mmr each later we're celebrating our 2nd anniversary! Dota is true romance.  * **Our first game** http://puu.sh/sURkP/e0f6ad0a32.jpg * **Our dota names for the next few months** http://puu.sh/sURlM/b678a4767b.jpg * **We made matching Dota TShirts** http://puu.sh/sUSEu/b48742f991.jpg * **Us now** http://puu.sh/sURnc/ba958e7f1f.jpg     Edit: Thanks for all the love guys we just got back from a dinner out and had a great time reading all the comments.

Reddit you are the only place that can help me get my masters degree please help!,self.DotA2,Edit: Thank you all for participating sadly Im getting spammed by some bots so I will stop taking more answers. My aim was to get 200 answers and I got more than 6000 so give yourself a clapIm very thankful. Results will be posted here during May.  Also thanks to all your wishes and positivity /r/dota2 you have saved me :)  Hello Reddit  I need your help.   Last year in August I did a short survey about last years Battle Pass. I have gotten more then 12 000 answers. With so many responses my professor who is the head of my study was really surprised and finally excited about my thesis. My thesis is about crowdfunding as a form of alternative financing for The International. So I have made second survey. This survey is better for analysis and better to draw conclusions from.   We have agreed with my professor that I will need at least 200 answers for this survey which seemed like no problem based on previous survey. I have created a long form survey and posted it here and to other sides such as Dotabuff and Dota 2 forum on steam but I didnt get more than 15 replies. (PepeHands) Ive deleted the old survey and created a shorter version of it by removing few questions and now Im here.  Im in really dire situation right now and only YOU can save me. Please I beg you please fill this survey and share it to help me achieve my goal of 200 responses. This survey is really important and its results will more or less decide if I even get my degree since its a big part of my finals. I hope that r/dota2 will safe me.  Link to the survey:  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiRiQH7SFqYh-_AdskXCzEkHIwdTRKWI-GJ_wWd_4g66j8tA/viewform  Thank you for reading and have a great day  TLDR: I have problem to repeat success of survey that focuses on Battle Pass and TI I may not get my diploma if I fail.

My friend is missing. Dota2 was an extremely big part of his life in the past 5 years and we think somebody from his former team might have a clue as to where he is. Here's his old team can you identify the players and maybe provide contact info for them?,self.DotA2,"**Resolution:** Misho contacted another of his friends. He is now at home safe and sound. Thank you very much for all the positive wishes and thoughts!    ----- ~~**UPDATE:** I have reason to believe another of Misho's friends is in contact with him. Hopefully he is well.   **UPDATE2:** Misho contacted another of his friends. He is not in the country but seems okay. We've sent him money and we are hoping he uses them to come home.

I learned a lot by talking to a lady outside of TI,self.DotA2,She's an older lady but she says she's been doing her job for all the TIs. At TIs she said she's the one who meets the players at the airports she also waits for them outside the player entrances and helps coordinate the busses as well.    It's my first TI and I actually just came to her for help (asking about Fisher lawn where the players enter etc.) and we ended up talking for a long time. She told me about how Dendi was really nice to her and she was sad he couldn't come to this TI. She also talked about Loda but she actually referred to him as Jonathan his first name.    When Team Empire arrived yesterday Resolution jumped out of the bus incredibly energized running around. The first thing he did was run up to this lady and hug her. It was so sweet. She said Dendi would do that too.    I wish I could have talked to her more. Yesterday she was standing outside of the press entrance. She enjoys talking and helping out others.    edit: spelling,personal

For my friend,teamliquid.net,,personal
No unless you're Merlini,self.DotA2,Merlini holds a special place in our hearts for varying reasons and I want to share why he means so much to me even though he doesn't know it.  A friend and I started playing dota about 12 years ago around the 6.34b era iirc. We used to go to our favourite lan cafe and just play casual 2v2s 3v3s etc. Living in Pakistan we didn't know of any professional scene in this game. In fact we never even considered that there could be real 'pro players' in gaming. We used to browse dota-allstars quite a bit though. I remember a post asking whether jungle Juggernaut could be viable. I remember an exact reply to that post: 'No unless you're Merlini'.  That was the turning point. Who is Merlini? Is he just another random player? Why does this guy know his name? I told my friend about it and we started searching for 'Merlini dota' and were just blown away. We found his legendary Zeus triple kill on shaker venge and leshrac with insane tango-tree play and clarity usage. We found his Rexxar jungling guide and found out this dude has invented a new way to play. We found out that he actually plays in a professional team called Meet Your Makers!  We found out about gg-no-re and started downloading MYM vs VP games. No casting sometimes a guy called inde_ed with a Gordon Freeman avatar would have casted a game very casually. We were just amazed at this new world we didn't even know existed. Soon we were following the pro scene religiously. A couple of years later we were over the moon  when we found out a fellow Pakistani and friend amartnt got the chance to play competitively in Kuroky's team!  It was a crazy time for us and we grew up with it. Not many folks here knew the pro scene but we used to sit in my friend's room downloading replays and just watching in awe at these amazing players from MYM and VP. Vigoss Ars-Art NS Admir Jolie Sahka Merlini Maelk H4nni Mania Slahser Levent. And other 'random' players like JollyJoker (all chat master) US|Wedge (techies pro) hitomi (Rhashta specialist) Loda (farming god and inventor of the deny) pink priestess (MYM girls team) and quite a few more.  Our love for this game grew exponentially because of these times and the memories we have are priceless. And it all began from a simple sentence: 'No unless you're Merlini'.  Today we are much older are married and live in different countries. We'll maybe play a game together once every two months. But we still follow the professional scene religiously. And every now and then we remember those awesome times and we remember Merlini and his jungling and his zeus. Our origins.  So Merlini I can not thank you enough. I just want to let you know how much you have contributed to this game and how you have made so many people's lives that much better. We all wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors and salute you for your contribution to this game we all love.  tl:dr; gtg exam! (MYM vs VP reference),personal
Please don't tell people to kill themselves. It's not a joke. RIP...,self.DotA2,I played a low priority game a while ago with [this guy Stephan](http://www.dotabuff.com/players/62567) and he sent me a friend request after. I didn't accept it because he was on the other team that destroyed me and I figured he just wanted to talk shit. But I guess I'll never know.  Some time in late September he changed his name to 'Committing suicide Farewell'. Pretty disturbing but I didn't think much of it figuring he wasn't being serious; just BabyRaging and being emo. But morbid curiosity made me keep checking his profile and I noticed that he was not playing. A few weeks go by and his name is changed to 'Stephan Dad plz msg info RIPoct2'. On his profile I see a few comments from others paying their respects. The guy actually killed himself.   According to his [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/soliveira_) he lost his job recently and decided to just start streaming. He was obviously going through a rough time (as many people who consume themselves with dota/video games are) and felt he had only one way out.  I'm not really sure what the point of this post is. I just needed to tell someone because it's really been bothering me. I didn't know him but honestly it's just really gut-wrenching and makes me feel sick that he was serious and this actually happened. I found out a few days ago and I've been thinking about it a lot. Maybe if I accepted his friend request and we became pals this wouldn't have happened. I guess I just wana say that guys you never know what someone's going though. It can be hard to remember that the people you're in game with are actual human beings with real problems and feelings. Maybe you're going through a tough time too. Its so easy to just be rude and flame and say terrible things from behind your computer screen that you probably don't mean but those things could seriously hurt someone. We can all try a bit harder to be more considerate of our fellow players whoever they are and wherever they may be from. I know I will.   RIP Stephan.    edit: To all the people saying this is fake: [It really isn't](https://i.imgur.com/gi8t1ed.jpg). Please stop making hurtful comments here or on his Twitch that his family may read.  ,personal
Statement regarding speculation around Ana situation.,self.DotA2,Ive repressed my feelings on the subject since January and was essentially forced to leave it and move on due to a mixture of personal hurt a busy schedule and lifes many other priorities. Regrettably the attention this situation has generated in addition to blatant speculation of my character in a public podcast streamed on twitch youtube and multiple Reddit threads have forced me into compiling this evidence to establish the facts and timeline of events.    Facts and timeline  * Conversations with Anas brother that shows I started talking to Anas family regarding professional esports back in 2014. https://imgur.com/a/8O3li   * This is my wife writing a sponsorship/invitation letter for Ana to apply for a VISA for entry and stay in Shanghai. https://imgur.com/a/oCSMG  * This shows a small portion of dialogue that proves I did in fact negotiate Ana onto OG. There are a lot more negotiations (not only on twitter) but I do not want to disclose any more private conversations than I need to out of respect for Tal (OG.Fly). https://imgur.com/a/ISSVZ  * This is a skype log between an OG player and myself it details the story from my side so I dont have to rewrite it again. Identity is blurred out of respect for that person. Please do note that when I have contacted players regarding this drama I made sure it is at a time that they are not playing any major tournaments as to not affect their performance. https://imgur.com/a/t7LBn  * Here is a chat log where Ana acknowledges my being his agent/manager and also that I suspected he and his family may betray me by not honoring their end of the deal. https://imgur.com/a/JefwL  * This is the contract I signed with Ana after leaving IG and before even negotiating with OG (Please note the timestamp of contract as well as the timestamps on the twitter messages with OG.Fly). https://imgur.com/a/qq5qa      Please note that the contract expires on Anas 18th birthday not 50 years as some people have speculated.       Finally the first agreement we agreed to before signing IG was with a 30% fee but because he found success much earlier than I had anticipated (Winning NEA) I offered to lower it without Ana or his mother asking and re-entered the agreement with my fee lowered considerably to 10%.   * This is an email transcript between OG manager and myself. https://imgur.com/a/jtfJx  * Aggrieved by the situation at hand I was constrained to send this letter of demand to Ana and his mom. https://imgur.com/a/wdGVH  * Ive linked the TI player profile for Ana you can see my involvement in Anas quick rise to stardom has been completely omitted. To my surprise it was made to appear like they have always been supportive and that IG reached out to Ana on their own. Moreover Anas mum says that Shanghai is her hometown and thats why she sent him however instead of staying with family Ana stayed with me under my care guidance and supervision. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h93757dO6DE   I wish I could go back in time and not have to go through any of this I cant help but feel betrayed after all the work I put in only to be ignored for such a little sum of money. I was blocked since January this year and in that time I have quit Dota2 I didnt even watch TI since I knew Ana would be competing.    I like to think I am a reasonable guy all I want is Ana to honor the original agreement and an apology. Every cent received by me minus legal fees will go to either a charity of /r/dota2s choice or a players-only tournament in which we can discover new talented players to join the pro dota2 scene (No established pros allowed).  A lot of readers especially the Chinese fans of dota2 have speculated and attacked my character because I defended Anas rights against IG. I just want to express that as Anas then manager/agent I acted on Anas best interest and that the issue is now resolved.  Ana I know you are reading this and probably wont reach out to me. I hope you can grow from this and I wish you the best of luck in future endeavors.   ,personal
I am d2bowie and this is my ti7 project,self.DotA2,"Hi everyone!   You probably never heard my name but saw one of my videos [miracle am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RaH2wsv1zU)  [zai pudge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBb-PK8iNO0)  [burning pa](https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=OR1kQciG0c4) **i mainly produce educative/tutorial videos about dota**.    It's been one year since i've started this journey. I gave up chemical engineering (mainly because being an engineer in brazil is actually working in an office 90% of the time) but also because my family couldn't afford me living in another town because of my grandpa getting sick and my pops lost his job. **i always had this creative side of me that i was never able to explore and having to get back to my parents house gave me a lot of time to spend doing content**.   This grew enough that i was able to move away from my parents house and work 100% in my yt channel. It's been almost one year since that happened and while i feel really grateful and accomplished with myslef i never attended TI. This is probably one of my biggest dreams and **while attending TI in itself is great i actually want to be there to produce the best content possible**.   I am crowdfunding this project so that i can bring someone with me to film it. Everything is throughly explained in the [indiegogo page i created](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/i-want-bowie-to-make-content-for-ti7-in-seatle-games/x/16740549#/)  **If you want a not so quick tldr:** --- **Plans before TI**  Produce videos talking about the first invited teams strategy/style/mannerisms . They would be done in a way that everyone can understand and aim at give that 5 min explanation for the casual viewer to what each team is about.  ---  **Plans during TI**  I will do everything i possibly can to give an overview of what ti is about. Vlogs/videos/interviews . This part is kinda tricky because getting interviews with well known players is hard specially when you're a no one like i am. One of the reasons i'm posting this on reddit is to maybe get enough exposure to do that.  The interviews though will try to get a different angle of the pro players than we usually see. I feel like a lot of the awkwardness that comes with player interviews is usually talking too much about personal life/ why did you win or lose .**I would like to ask more questions about the game  something they are clearly passionate about.** I know they won't talk about strats  but i never saw anyone asking pros about tips to winning ranked games what do they think about an enemies strat and stuff like that. **I would also like to do some sort of comparisson between the pannels opinnion on certain games and what the average ti viewer thinks about it there's a lot of cool things that can be done**.  ---   **Plans after TI** I would love to produce very well thought videos about every game of the finals in the usually timely friendly manner that i approach my own videos. I feel like there's a lot of content being made today but they are either too long and not planned or they are old.   **Another plan i have (if this gets enough exposure) is have a compilation of pro players talking about different aspects of the finals and why they think ""x"" worked or not. Instead of just 747 or ppd talking about it we would have a great video with a lot of different insight**. I feel like the only barrier to this part is this getting big since with ti ending most pros wouldn't hold their opinions (the patch will probably change a lot after it).  ---  This actually turned out way bigger than i expected.  **I want to do this even if the project doesn't get entirely funded. Still though it wouldn't be possible for me to pay for the expenses of both the other person and myself.** (I also don't have ti tickets which at this point seems like a small problem). If this idea seems cool  if you like my videos or the content i produce and you already bought all the compendium levels you wished i would be more than happy with any help!   EDIT: I never expected so much response for this. I am so anxious that i couldn't sleep since i posted this and it was already super late when i decided to . I'm streaming trying to relax and see if i can get back to [sleeping](https://www.twitch.tv/d2bowi3) . Thanks everyone :)",personal
"With the TI6 main event about 10 hours away I wanted to share my TI ""Core Memories"" with you",self.DotA2,"Greetings and **EXTREMELY LONG POST AHEAD WARNING** Dota fans!  Over the past week or so as I've been reading through all of the threads and discussions about TI6 I've caught myself acting like the old man I am... meaning I've been leaving many comments about the way-back-when days sharing memories and spinning yarns. And inevitably as I've shared those thoughts and experiences even more have come to mind. Going back in time and remembering that part of my life has brought me a lot of bittersweet joy. Now with the main event only a handful of hours away I can't think of a better time to share my TI core memories with you given that all of you have been there with me every step of the way.  If I'm honest there's also an emotional healing element to all of this which will be made clear by the end. There are a lot of things involving the family nature of GoodGame Evil Geniuses and Alliance and how tight nit we are which I think the community will appreciate.  I've decided to skip stories about commentating particular games or series and except in cases where exceptions are obvious anything about gameplay/results as a whole. Most people have seen those moments. At any rate I hope you enjoy... I know I did through the ups and downs alike.  ---  **TI2**  ---  **First time walking into TI**  * I had only been playing Dota for eight months and casting it for five when I arrived in Seattle and walked into Benaroya to cast TI2 at the invitation of IceFrog. I toddled into that foyer with the awkwardness of a kid on his first day at a new school. I walked up to the first group of people I spotted wearing Valve shirts stuck out my hand and said ""Hi I'm Ayesee."" Doug Wood of Valve turned and said ""I recognize that voice!"" Afterward I introduced myself to Tobi who went out of his way to guide me around and introduce me to all of the other casters hosts and panelists who'd go on to be some of my best friends and favorite people in the world. [I'll always be thankful to him for that](http://i.imgur.com/DSRLUqA.jpg).  **Meeting Gabe Newell**  * Second day I was there before the event even started sitting down in the cafeteria/green room area used by talent and staff by myself drinking a diet coke. In walks Gabe who sits down RIGHT beside me. Starstruck I stuck out my hand and said ""Hey Mr. Newell I'm Aaron..."" and he shook my hand and said ""Of course I know you you're Ayesee."" To this day I have no words to describe that feeling. It wasn't pride. It was something closer to humility mixed with validation. Feeling humbled that you were given the chance to do the work you do intertwined with a feeling of graciousness that you'd done something right to be alive in that experience.  **My first real Greetings and Salutations**  * Sure I'd said it hundreds (if not thousands) of times on stream before... but saying those words live to a packed audience at a million dollar tournament in a moment that represented a genuine dream come true is just... well different. Yes I had worked in radio for years but in radio you're alone in a small studio you can't feel or see your audience. Staring out over the sea of people it hit me - hundreds of thousands of people were at home and thousands were in front of me waiting for me to be a voice for their memories of this moment. My hands started to shake my chest started to tremble. I heard the producer in my ear say ""GO COMMENTATORS"" and as if someone had hit a button I bellowed out my greetings... and the crowd roared in response. I've never been nervous in front of an audience since that moment.  **Meeting Alex Garfield**  * After TI2 I was milling around the lobby while the DJ spun his tunes for the after party when a guy in an EG shirt came up to me and asked what I thought of the event. I didn't recognize him but he had the most profound look of focus and understanding in his eyes. Everything about him screamed ""this seems like a cool guy."" We talked and shot the shit about the event the matches etc until a Team Liquid writer interrupted us. He said ""I see what's going on! Trying to hire Ayesee!"" I put the pieces together and realized it was THE Alex Garfield a man I only knew as a name. I started working for EG/GGA the next month and moved out to SF to work on site full time 8 months later - one of the first 8 founding members of our home office in the Bay. Alex's belief in me changed my life beyond my wildest dreams and the moments we've shared together... you can't imagine. More on those later.  ---  **TI3**  ---  **Late night soccer at the Westin**  * I don't play soccer. I don't like soccer. But I'll always remember this moment because of how it sums up people who work in eSports - serious driven individuals... who are just kids at heart. I remember coming back to the Westin very late one of the nights of the main event. I went up to the ballrooms marked off for talent to relax/eat/drink with hopes for a nightcap. What I found was a full blown game of soccer taking place in the large open area in front of the ballrooms. Almost everyone still awake was playing. I sat down watched and commentated. Maybe you had to be there but it was... something special.  **Alliance wins the Grand Finals**  * I got to be that fanboy in the Alliance box during the Grand Finals surrounded by the friends and coworkers I loved the most. The end... the dream coil... the moment that ancient exploded. You could give me 10000 words and I still couldn't capture it. I remember Cody Connors jumped on my back and I jumped up and down with him ON my back. I remember I was standing right next to Alex and he literally almost fainted - eyes fluttered and he stumbled backwards against the wall lmao. I grabbed him hugged him and lifted him off the ground with tears in my eyes. We all hugged everyone else we could get our hands on then Alex myself and Sean Green (GGA photographer) ran as quickly as we could down from the balcony to backstage. We were there waiting to greet our boys as soon as they walked off stage. More tears. More hugs. Everything from there is a blur - we hung around talked and laughed then as a group we all went to dinner... with the Aegis sitting in the middle of the table. Somewhere on someone's cell phone exists a picture of Alex and I holding the aegis together at that dinner.  ---  **TI4**  ---  **Not doing the main stage**  * TI4 was hard for me in a lot of ways... really hard. As a member of GGA my day to day life and work responsibilities began to pivot away from simply casting Dota to being a part of much larger projects in much more impactful roles. I was doing more work in eSports than ever... but doing less casting. By the time TI4 invites were set to go out I knew there was a chance I wouldn't be asked to do the main stage that year. Which is what ended up happening. I was devastated. Like didn't leave the house for days devastated. And being physically present at TI4 in that diminished role wasn't any easier. Even though I didn't know it at the time that pain I was feeling was the pain of change resulting from slow evolutions happening inside me as a person and involving me in the industry. I just wasn't ready for it. Looking back those memories are still hard... but they were inevitable. And what got me through it was the endless support I got from Dota fans all over the world both online and in person at that event. Thank you. You know who you are. Ultimately even though I didn't know it at the time my efforts and energy being required for other projects turned out to be my small part to play in our acquisition by Twitch which was already in the works. I just didn't know that until much later.  **Getting to know the item creators**  * You know those awesome people who make the hats that keep this whole TI thing growing year after year? Listen closely when I tell you this: they are some of the most talented funny intelligent people you'll ever meet... and some of my favorite people in the whole world. This was the year I really got to know them - Manny Anuxi Danidem Thiago Terracotta the list goes on and on. I've spent more nights than I can count at dinner in bars in hotel rooms on rooftops and just wandering the streets partying with these amazing folks. And no matter how many times we get together I'm sad when we have to say goodbye and can't wait for the next chance to say hello. I'm sure some of you are reading this - please know I love you. And you've all helped me get through some of the hardest times in my life... this year and especially around TI5.   ---  **TI5**  ---  **Note:** TI5 is hard of me to write about. Just typing that sentence has tears welling up in my eyes. It was the single most emotionally violent and turbulent period of my life I'd ever experienced. Low to high to low to high again... to the lowest I've ever been. I don't know how to list these events except sequentially. I've never shared them before with anyone outside of closest friends and family... but if I'm going to do this I'm going to do it right. The formatting for this section is a little different so bare with me.  **My first TI on the sidelines**  Title says it all. This was the first year I wasn't invited to participate in a TI as talent. If you've read this far and read the experiences above you can imagine how hard this was for me. By that time though my life had changed so much that I knew it was the next step in my transition from ""Ayesee the Dota caster"" to ""Ayesee the eSports industry professional who still casts Dota when he can."" Thankfully I once again had the full GGA family around me to help me remember that while a part of my life had been left behind it was another step towards the future.  **My Father Ronald Chambers**  EG was in the Grand Finals. The whole gang was there. The GGA suite was packed with almost every person who was or had ever been a part of GGA... who'd ever been an Evil Genius. I can look at this moment surrounded by all those people I was lucky enough to have in my life all of us sharing this moment together as one of the most profound I'd ever experienced.  EG had just won game 1 against CDEC and we were all riding on a high that can't be comprehended. I ducked outside for some air and sunshine and my phone rang - it was my parents calling. I answered excited at their timing as I could tell them all about the event so far and that our team was winning! We were THIS CLOSE to Evil Geniuses - to OUR TEAM - being TI5 champions!  I answered practically shaking with excitement. Mom knew all about EG and Dota and my work. I couldn't wait to tell her. Mom said hello and I stammered out ""Hey mom guess what! We're doing it! EG is in the Grand Finals!"" But she interrupted me. My father who'd been having serious health problems for the last five years had collapsed earlier that morning and been taken to the hospital. He was in a coma. And they weren't sure if he would ever wake up.  I don't know how to verbally describe a moment like that. Every word or phrase that comes to mind feels cheap. So I'm not going to even try. I wept and I almost fell over. I couldn't stand up without leaning on something.  I honestly don't remember what I asked her and what she told me in specific. Just vague notions we communicated back and forth. He was in a coma and it'd be a day or two before we knew if he had the possibility to wake up or not. He was on life support. There was nothing I could do. Nothing she could do.  I told her I was going to fly home immediately. She told me no that I should stay. He was breathing on life support and that wasn't going to change. If he woke up in the mean time everything would be okay. If he didn't that wasn't going to change by me being there. I was completely stunned. I told her I had to come home. What she said next shocked me:  ""No baby. You go win. It's what Dad would want.""  And she was right. Ever since I left my old business and moved home to help her take care of Dad full time in 2011 he'd been my rock and biggest motivator. During that time I lived with her and Dad and did side radio/broadcasting jobs and worked in eSports to earn money. I'd take care of him most of the time then broadcast Dota and do other eSports work in between. And while she was always supportive it was Dad that asked me every day about eSports - about Dota about this crazy industry I was trying to break into. It was him that when I was invited to cast TI2 called my friends over to help him figure out how to watch me cast on his potato computer. It was him that used that potato computer to look up and read articles about Evil Geniuses and Alliance even though he had almost no idea what he was reading... he just knew it was our teams. He knew we were Evil Geniuses. It was him that cried tears of joy when I told him I was moving to San Francisco to work in this industry full time. It was him that made me who I am today.  He was my biggest fan.  So I listened to him and to my mother and stayed.  **Circle the wagons**  It's a cliche but in this case it's true. So many of my memories about this final day are a blur - a lot of hazy images and feelings with extremely bright and clear moments woven in. I remember going back to the GGA suite a crying mess and not knowing what to do but seek out Alex and Colin DeShong (GGA COO my mentor and my very good friend) and tell them what had happened and that depending on when my mother called back with news I may have to fly out on very short notice.  They barely said a word. Just hugged me and didn't let go until I was done with needing to be hugged. Which bless their hearts took a while. This continued with every person in the box. Dozens of them.  They then took me up to the front row of seats in the box and parked my ass between them. And we cheered on Evil Geniuses to victory.  **Prologue**  The day I arrived back in SF from TI I got another call from my mother. My father was never going to wake up. I told Colin I had to leave immediately. He told me they were paying for mine and Sherry's (my GF) flights home and that there was no date I was expected to be back. To take as long as I needed. They only wanted to hear from me if there was anything I needed even if it was just to talk.  My father passed away on August 13th 2015. This year's grand finals will be one year to the day since he passed.  I stayed home for 2-3 weeks. When I finally came back once again it was GGA who booked my flights. And they flew us first class - the one and only time I've flown first class.  I came back to the office still a wreck but wanted to achieve some degree of normalcy. I walked in and headed back towards our area of Twitch. I saw Alex sitting in a booth in the cafeteria with his earbuds in working on his laptop - I didn't think he saw me and he looked busy so I walked on past.  I hadn't taken 10 more steps when I felt a hand on my shoulder - Alex had spotted me and chased me down. He hugged me and welcomed me back and shared some words that are just for he and I.  I walked on back to our area and was similarly welcomed back by everyone. Then I spotted a big picture frame on my desk.   [At the direction of Alex and Colin GGA commissioned a very special painting for me.](http://i.imgur.com/WDA7Z3n.jpg)  At the bottom left is my father and I. Middle the TI5 stage. The sides my two favorite and most played Dota characters. On the back are lot of signatures and messages most of which are too personal to share.  It's the single most valuable material possession I've ever owned.  ---  **Thanks**  ---  I'd imagine not many made it this far but if you have there they are... my TI core memories. Concerning the emotional stuff at the end that's the healing I was talking about... and more than anything I wanted everyone to understand how special of an organization GGA has been over the years. I couldn't have survived without them. All of these memories have been made possible by you the Dota fans. And it's my pleasure to share them with you the way you all so often share your own with me.  This year will be a little hard for me after TI5 and because of other changes that I can't get into. But this year will be Sherry's first eSports event ever... not a bad one to start with huh? She'll be there with me. I hope some of you will come say hello.  Thank you Dota community members for allowing my life to be made up of these moments. Thank you Valve and all your staffers for how amazingly helpful and supportive you've always been allowing me to be a part of this historic community you've created. Thank you IceFrog for giving an unknown commentator from West Virginia a chance. Thank you to every commentator host player and personality for letting me be a part of this special group with you.  Thank you Alex and Colin for believing in me and making me an Evil Genius - and for being the most supportive friends for which I could ever ask. Thank you everyone at GGA for being my family in the only ways that matter. Thank you to my mother and the rest of my family for everything.  Thank you Dad.",personal

Hey everyone BigDaddyN0tail here: ),self.DotA2,Hello!  I've been wanting to do a statement for a while regarding the shuffle and why I am no longer on Team Secret but I've been very busy with Christmas New Years and I've been thinking a lot about what to say.  Let me take you back to the very beginning of this team. Myself and Kuro were talking together in Seattle after TI4. We got along very well and still do but at the time we were unhappy with how things had went in the past Dota related.  Talks kept happening and we ended up deciding on forming a team together with a very specific idea in mind. This would be a winning team a team built to win. If a problem would occur within the team the problem would be solved within the team if that's turns out not to be possible the team would fix it the other way (i.e. roster replacements). And that's what has happened this last month and a half.  I have a very good relationship with everyone remaining in secret there is not a single ounce of bad blood between us and I don't see a reason for there to be any. The decision to remove me and misery for Zai and Arteezy I completely understand I would be stupid if I don't get the reasoning behind this decision. They're very talented players and there were some issues within the team although minor issues the team thinks it can do better with this change.  For the people following the scene closely you will have already seen I found my place in the Cloud9 team and I am very positive about what we can accomplish but that post is for another time :)  The main point of this post is to remove any negativity towards any of these players that jumped teams whether its Secret EG or C9.  We are just young boiz that wanna play doto ^^  Thanks for reading enjoy the scene and don't make it worse!,personal

Dear SingSing,self.DotA2,"Hi   I make a new account every time I use Reddit which is around once every 3 - 6 months basically only when I have a burning question. Well this is my latest throwaway that I could remember its login details.   This one is for my friend Gordon. Gordon was an avid follower of Dota 2 and also of r/dota2. But as of 4 days ago Gordon was no more. What was a decent-looking guy studying his ass of in grad school with glimmering eyes and a dazzling smile is now a flat line and a constant deafening sound from the machine that is supposed to tell you good news.   Aneurysm. You get one warning. A red line. That's what he told me when he was lucky enough to survive the first one. Afterwards he lost parts of his memory was not the same person anymore and he was laughing hysterically and uncontrollably when his countdown popped. He got no second warning.   I guess this is my form of raging and ranting so as to fix the mess of emotions that I am in right now or whatever. I don't know. But when Gordon was here he was probably the number 1 fan of SingSing and probably for the same reason people like him for: his relaxed attitude his troll builds his goofiness and an overall optimistic and/or salty outlook on his games.   After the first one struck and he had to go to the hospital he became almost another person. His movements were jittery his moods swung wildly he couldn't control his emotions. He would log onto Dota play well or badly flame his teammates then instantly apologise relentlessly at times bursting into tears. He loses it. And he gets it. He knows that it's happening to him. Somehow he knows that he was minutes ago laughing but now he's all in tears. And the people man. The people. When your teammates flame you and then literally cry to apologise through voice chat you would call them names. I don't know. Retard fag things like that. Those ones Gordon could stand. But the worst ones mate were the ""I hope you get brain damage and die"".   It hurt him. And I knew it because I was there supporting his carry Luna with very good farm at 15:00. Mates he lost his shit and said ""Why do I take this fucking game seriously? Why? This is why I get this mood swings bullshit. Why can't I be like SingSing?""   Now before you say anything about SingSing Gordon didn't mean to demean him or put him in a bad light. He was his big fan for fucking God's sake. He wanted to simply be optimistic and to take Dota like a game. And he couldn't. And his rational thoughts instead of pointing out that he suffered mood swings because the doctors did something to his brain after the first aneurysm it told him to think that being dedicated and taking Dota ""too seriously"" caused this.   And it all started because of a flame.   Hey SingSing if you are reading this. Thank you. I know this post is windy and makes no sense. But I just want you to know that my friend was a big fan of yours. He loved your style he loved your troll attempts he loved your competitive plays he loved it when you yell ""Babushka"" or ""Davai Davai"" or ""We fucking lost"". You were a big part of him mate! After the first aneurysm you became a big part of his daily routine and you know what the most touching part is? SingSing he looks at  you streaming and he says:   Damn this guy is so positive. He doesn't have mood swings. His mood is stable. He's always positive. I wish I could be like him.   And he smiles to himself until the next tantrum takes over and he starts weeping. I've seen it. And damn it fucking hurts me to my bone.   I want to say Thank You to you SingSing if in the slightest chance you are reading this. I want to say thank you for accompanying Gordon to his very very last day. I want to thank you for being an exceptional streamer and for putting positivity into a soul that was torn in half. Thank you.   Guys please please please please please if you could be positive in your games. You don't know who is behind that feeding Crystal Maiden or who is behind that instalock LC jungle. We ALL are human behind those pixels. Whether it is rushing a Blink or feeding mid it's a human being behind it. With the extra protection of anonymity and a will to win it is so easy to lash out at everyone. But think about it maybe your innocuous daily banter could trigger someone's worst nightmares and cause so many disastrous consequences.   Now I know there will be people who will not be believing this because common it's Reddit. I'm not asking you to. I can't prove it. I'm just another guy who lost a good friend. I'm an emotional mess and I kind of want to rant about it. Even if you don't believe it send a prayer to Gordon and the next time you're ready to flame someone think about how things would turn out if you said: ""Hey Crystal Maiden I think it would be better if next time you bought a Glimmer Cape instead of a Yasha"".    Gordon Gordon Gordon. You're a damn fine bloke. I'm gonna miss you. You're a positive guy my friend. And you learnt it from Sing and he is probably very happy that he taught a guy to be positive.

As a newcomer in Dota Turbo has been a complete gamechanger,self.DotA2,* It's fast as hell meaning i can try out new heroes and do new stuff without a big risk. If i fuck up i'm not gonna be stuck for an hour getting pounded in spawn. Warlock looks cool? Pick him and see what happens! I tried out *Templar-Fucking-Assassin* and actually got kills. I would never have done this in a regular game.   * I get all the important items such as Blink Scepter and so on every game which means i can actually learn them. Everyone get's level 25 almost every game which means you can actually parttake fully. My 4k Dota-friends kept raging at me for not properly using Blink Dagger after getting it every game in Turbo i finally got the hang of it.   * Everyone farms so much faster meaning a mistake (which you make tons of in the beginning) doesn't fuck you up near as much. This is so liberating.   * Since it's unranked and the games are so short people are a lot less angry. In fact i have barely seen any toxicity yet. No more sinking feeling in the chest after dying to a tower early-game and  telling me to uninstall.   * I understand the gold shops and the courir are integral parts of the mechanics in Dota. As a new player though it's not the most fun stuff to fiddle around with. Turbo let's me focus on and learning the fun-stuff. Killing opponents team-fighting growing stronger and getting items. It's super-rewarding as a newcomer.   * The fast-pace and the short games let's me play 4-5 games a day everytime a new hero which makes me well on my way to actually learn something. I'm easily gonna have played +100 games before the end of the month which might actually get me somewhere.   * Because of the short games the fun and the general non-threatening nature of Turbo i've gotten several of my friends to try Dota. Now we are 4-5 people playing daily and on our way to becoming Dota-players. All of them new but experienced CS GO-players. This would never have happened without Turbo. Everyones previous experience of Dota was just being eight levels behind and getting molested in spawn by a Phantom Assasin-smurf until someone disconnected. Now we are grinding and have basically just copied our teamwork and mentality from CS GO into a new game.   * I might be what you consider a filthy casual but Turbo has been a complete gamechanger for me and i think it could be a huuuge addition to Dota as a game. It's the deep game of Dota with the best parts (don't kill me) of Leagues which is the accessibility and the fun. Will definitely keep playing and see what happens.   Edit: This blew up! Add me if you wanna play! https://steamcommunity.com/id/henriksand/,personal
Accidentally Scammed Someone @ Boston Major,self.DotA2,"So the short of it is exactly in the title. Due to circumstances I had to leave the Boston Major sooner than expected. I met a spectator last night at a sushi bar across from the venue who was looking to buy a finals ticket. Perfect. Except after I drove home and emptying my pockets I find out that I gave him my Friday ticket and not my Saturday.   No idea if he browses reddit or not but I did give him my channel info so maybe he'll come yell at me there.  Fully unintended to ""scam"" ya buddy and if I can verify it's you I'd be more than willing to Paypal you the money back.",personal
Anyone else having trouble targetting things?,self.DotA2,Since Reborn came out I've been having trouble clicking things such as trying to harass the enemy in lane but ultimately moving to that position rather than attacking him/her. It's even worse when they're next to creeps as I would whiff spells on them which almost never happened when I played in source 1. I never had this problem before until source 2.,personal
Thank you Dota 2. I owe you one.,self.DotA2,"edit: holy shit front page. thank you reddit. i'm so happy about all this.  edit 2: holy lord Gold? thank you fellow redditor. thank you for your kindness.  edit 3: so I went to sleep and... what the fuck reddit. this is incredible... Also since this got kind of overly viral I just kind of want to reiterate that this isn't a fantasy or a creative writing. I know it isn't the easiest thing to believe in because of the language and the way I poke fun of myself despite going through all this. Why did I even want to write this edit? Because I want people to realise that  - Bullying can be Hollywood-movies brutal and there are way too many male bully victims who cannot speak out due to various reasons. - What some Western countries call ""extreme homophobia"" is childplay in other countries. Vietnam is one of those ""other countries"". - Yes bullying and depression leaves scars that usually affect people FOR LIFE. Yet that doesn't mean they get wimpy and completely emotional whenever it is mentioned. **What doesn't kill me makes me more dank**. Doesn't mean I'm shitposting simply means **I got my shit together**. Also poking fun of myself is another one of my way saying **You fucked up my past but all your efforts simply (literally) gave me a laugh** - I'm not a good feeling describer so I simply wrote what I felt. Also the grotesque details in this thing no matter how grotesque was *what ran through the mind of a bullied 15yrold*.  I didn't feel like repressing it. What's the point? *cumstains* and *anus* and all the other graphic stuffs aren't there for positive effect. They are there to **truly describe what I felt**. I could have used euphemism to make it seem more real yes. However doing so would also mean I failed to face how I really really felt about the situation. *cumstain* as a word can be a turn-on for other people. However in this context it is a sign of shame.  I want to thank everyone for the support and everyone who didn't support it. You spent the time to read my story and it affected you in some way be it positive negative or lolzshitpost. I appreciate it. I have always been a lurker on this site but hey **Dota 2 sub you can be as dank as you are sympathetic and awesome**  Pardon me for my English as I'm not a native speaker. I'm using a throwaway for anonymity. Also this post might contain information can trigger negative responses. I respect your beliefs and if you feel like you are going to be offended please move onto the next shitpost about ~~jungle LC~~ Usernames that are longer than Bull Dong's Dong. --- Here goes the story  For all my life I have not had the easiest childhood. I was always a scrawny Asian kid who could not fit in. I was weak and clumsy and awkward. My so-called ""friends"" would not talk to me ever and they told the whole school to stay away from me. It was horrible but I was fine. At least I was left... alone. Yet loneliness did not even last long when I came home black and blue covered in bruises day by day. I would go to school take a beating getting catcalled and went home. ""F*ggot queer c*cksucker p*ssyboy"" you name it. I had it all. For a country as homophobic as Vietnam there was barely anything I could do. Everyday of school felt like literal living hell. The catcalls were not so bad. Neither were the punches nor the kicks. Nothing was nearly as bad as being pinned against the walls of a closed bathroom cubicle with a cloth in my mouth and three hungry highschoolers queuing up behind me taking turns to ""fuck the gay out of me"". When the party is done and they were satisfied they would let me go never forgetting to leave a death threat if I spreaded it out. I staggered home my face washed of the cumstains that would forever haunt me. My soul however was dirtied - squished stomped on turned into a cheap gloryhole for the enjoyment of people. I was stuck. My parents would have killed me if I told them a thing. My school was against anything not heterosexual. My world day by day collapsed. I had it all.   Whenever I was home after I was done with bawling my eyes out cutting myself skipping meals and every other self-harm courses of action a 15yearold could manage I would turn to Dota as a last resort. I've known it since the Defense of the Ancients day and it never left me. I was never a good player but I didn't care. Dota was the drug and I was the addict as focusing on landing a perfect Mass Serpent Ward would take me away from the still-open scars in my anus that would open up tomorrow and the day after that because my ""pussy"" needed to be ""satisfied"" by those 3 people. So I played. And I played a lot. During the course of a normal game I met a teammate called Glen. I still remembered that match I was Shadow Shaman and he was Wisp. We were losing badly and the other 3 teammates started to become toxic. I always tried to be a positive dude in my games and so was Glen. We were spamming mic to cheer our teammates up. He was cracking jokes about my terrible attempts at Snakeblocking the enemies despite having had a Euls. From something like 3 - 25 we managed to get a crazy number of pickoffs and were able to get our items. Long story short we won and I added Glen on Steam. We almost always played daily from 6 pm to 10 pm and would chat on Steam about how we could improve ourselves. As time went by we became more comfortable with each other and we started to open up. We started to talk less about aiming ET's combo and more about ourselves. I felt for the first time in my life as if I was not alone.   Glen was my friend. Albeit my online unreal friend whose real name I probably did not even know but he was a friend. Glen was the first person to whom I told about the beatings and the catcalls probably because I felt safe behind this ""internet anonymity"". My walls started to slowly break down not because I trusted him but because I was desparately looking for something if anything to put my trust into. I bawled my eyes out while typing angrily at Steam chat. He would say it's okay and try to cheer me up usually by carrying me through the trench using ridiculous hero builds. Armlet CM Orchid Leshrac you name it. Playing Dota with Glen was something I looked forward to when my days were dark. He would always attempt to make the corniest jokes on mic in order to make me laugh. After every game and every post-game Steam rant I opened up a bit more until I was naked. I told Glen everything about me and so did he. I knew where he lived and it turned out we lived very close to each other 5 minutes walking distance.   Ever since that day we hung out together. Everything was the same. My days were shitty. I felt like shit. I wanted to kill myself. I was stuck. However Glen was there with me and so was Dota. Glen was there with me playing Wisp and Relocating a RO + Agha Shadow Shaman into the enemy's base for an unexpected rat. Glen was there with me talking to me about our games and about ourselves when just 4 months ago we were Steam strangers foolishly divulging our deep dark secrets. Everything was the same but it was different because Glen was there. An abused kid and an orphan playing Dota together to forget this bitter world.   As I'm writing this my brain is writhing and aching with wounds from the past that for me would never be closed. The ghost-white walls of the cubicle my pale face with what felt like buckets of cum and hatred on it. Yes I still feel terrible and I probably will always do. But as I'm writing this there is a tall and handsome guy ready to take me to dinner.   I won't be alone. He would be there with me at my table. He would hold my hands like the first time he did when we were hi-fiving after a Rampage but none of us wanted to let go. We would talk about Dota like we always did two little kids peeling their souls on Steam chat. I can't be more thankful that I found him in my life - no I can't be more thankful that I found Dota in my life.   It was because of Dota that I was able to last through the many days that felt almost unbearable. ""All Pick!"" was what kept me going. It gave me just the boost of hope that I needed to not do dumb things to myself and I survived - barely but I survived til the day I met my Wisp picker and added him as my first Steam friend.  I am grateful for every moment that I'm spending with Glen and all of the memories we have had playing Dota together. Those last hits contest in which the loser becomes the bottom and I would always pick something as horrendous as a CM so as to deliberately let him win. Those moments when neither of us casted a spell on a dying enemy because ""I'M THE SUPPORT. NO I AM. FUCK OFF YOU'RE A 4. YOU TAKE THE KILL"" and the 10hp CM got away Allchatting ""Wat"". Those moments when he was tryharding so that his MMR would be higher than mine and I would snuck under his desk working my magic while he played his position 4 Wisp feeling constantly Overcharged. Sometimes he even died out. And the Shadow Shaman cake. And those super cool Shadow Shaman Golden item for our anniversary (I told him I'd get him his long-awaited Wisp Arcana). You know what all of this is so fucking awesome and I'm feeling so fucking lucky because I literally went to hell and back (but not back to hell and back).  **All because I kept on playing Dota 2**.   I know it sounds cheesy but things **do get better**. It probably will not turn out great but it definitely does get better. For those of you who are for whatever reasons using Dota as a safe place know that it things do change and if Dota is the only thing that makes you hold onto yourself play the hell out of it. But also when you've got the bare minimum energy to survive for another day look for a change - anything anybody - that could help you.   To Glen and I hope you read this. I love Shadow Shaman so much that if you think he's off-meta you can go fuck yourself instead of me.  TL; DR: Bullied in school depressed self-harmed Dota-ed the day away made friend talked to friend turned out friend lived nextdoor hung out with friend things got better still playing Dota feeling thankful as hell.",personal
Arc Warden was buffed but it was too late,self.DotA2,I had a friend.  He was the best CK I have ever seen.  He used to play Arc Warden even after every nerf and still managed to win with it.  He used to do silly combos with me and my other friends.  As I said he was the best CK player I have ever seen.  He rode into the fights with calm.  He used to say he had a bunch of illusions fighting and one resting.  He was nice to his horse.  Lets go Armageddon he used to say on discord call.  A beast of farming.  A player who know when and how to end the games.  We played together 400 games in a short span of time.  He started playing two years ago.  But we were friends for nine years.  We played a lot of other games; we had a lot of fun.  I made videos with him and my other friend theyre still on YouTube.  We were the inseparable trio.  Were.  Was.  Used to be.  One day not long ago my other friend sent me a message.  He the best CK player I have ever seen was not with us anymore.  A note saying that it was fun and that he was sorry.  A note saying goodbye and with hope of seeing us again in the afterlife.  A final note.  I still remember the day he said that they would buff Arc Warden the day he died.  He died and later that day 7.12 came out.   One final joke.  Last online: 10 days ago.  And the trio became a duo forever.  ---  ^^^**Edit:** ^^^Thanks ^^^for ^^^the ^^^nice ^^^comments ^^^and ^^^also ^^^for ^^^the ^^^bad ^^^comments. ^^^I ^^^hope ^^^nobody ^^^here ^^^goes ^^^through ^^^something ^^^like ^^^this. ^^^If ^^^you're ^^^going ^^^through ^^^harsh ^^^times ^^^on ^^^life ^^^know ^^^there ^^^will ^^^always ^^^be ^^^someone ^^^there ^^^for ^^^you ^^^to ^^^talk ^^^with. ^^^Even ^^^if ^^^you ^^^think ^^^you ^^^have ^^^nobody ^^^you ^^^can ^^^count ^^^on ^^^me ^^^and ^^^even ^^^as ^^^an ^^^unknown ^^^for ^^^you ^^^imma ^^^still ^^^try ^^^to ^^^help ^^^you ^^^out.,personal

Every single player who copies the name of a pro player is shit.,self.DotA2,I've never seen a good Miracle- Ditya Ra Dendi whoever - they're all hysterically bad.   I wonder if this self-consciously a joke or if they actually think they're good.,personal
If Liquid wins TI7 I'll tattoo MinD_ContRoL face on my ass,self.DotA2,"MinD_ContRoL is someone I've followed and respected long before he became a pro player. Back when I was higher mmr than him and before NEL days (for him). He played his old classic Clockwerk in the offlane 1v3 lanes. DESTROYING HIS 1vs3 LANES. Killing my carries and supports under the tower while I little shit was jacking in the offlane. 1 VS 3. 1 VS 3 HE DID THIS.  I've been trying to find the game but I can't. I do have this though https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1313758781 (chat Oracle me)  I always get very emotional when I see him have success. Seeing him and @Liquid get to the final gives me a feeling I can't describe. It's weird cause it feels like I am there winning myself but it's them. I just love them.   I think it'll be worth tattooing (that a word? xdxdxDX) cause whenever I see his face I get happy. I like my fine ass too so don't worry a mirror will do whenever I feel lonely.  Now fuck off and release yalls energy!    () () TAKE MY ENERGY TEAM LIQUID ()()  --------------------------------------------------------------  EDIT: HOLY MAKAFUCKINGRONI LIQUID! I'm shaking so damn happy for the boys :O;zczxkckaSKDkas  It'd be awesome if some of you talented guys could make some sort of art I could use for the tattoo. I'm imagining something like a portrait of his face to under tits with stacks of money on the side of him. You guys go ham cause I have no idea how it should look :D  I'll update on https://twitter.com/ddsama910 when I go take it. I'll post it here aswell so hope yall like some booty. (If mods let it up)  Will do it as soon as possible. GG Newbee and grats to all Liquid supporters! This TI have felt so amazing. Not sure how much that's amplified by Liquid winning but great yes.   Gratz too all of Dota 2 community for making this event possible!  I love you reddit hope you all great and gl in your lives! Hope you all good.  aight i should shut hte fuck up cuz imma go of on some random shit stopping myself GRATS EVERYONE  ---------------------------------------------  Edit3: I'll be going to bed barely slept during all TI. If you have questions unrelated to the tattoo fire away and I'll answer them once I wake up. Not played Dota since december last year. I'm excited for the new season. Happy new year everyone!  ---------------------------------------------  Edit4: I will follow through with this but it's gonna take some time. The closest tattoo shop to me is 200km away. I'm not doing this just for reddit so to yall whos so concerned about this all being a mistake. If I ever get in an argument I can just shoot out the ""I have a Tea Eye winner on my ass"". If it becomes a problem later in life I can just taze it up and literally shit his face out. Also I've thought about how many memories I will forget once dota is gone. Maybe this tattoo will keep me in check.   I'm trying to figure out how much it will cost n get my dad on a roadtrip not knowing whats up. This threads done. Patience from Zhou.",personal

Today is my last day of Dota 2 and my last day with energy,self.DotA2,Edit: The GoFundMe is live. https://www.gofundme.com/2sce97qf   Also like I said if I was going to do it I'd also post my Steam ID to show I'm not here to scam people out of their hard-earned money. Here you go. http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathstrokedota - Feel free to shoot me an invite!  Also for further proof that the Facebook account associated with the GoFundMe is really mine [click here.](https://www.facebook.com/Highzenburg/posts/10209515573559188)  Thank you all for your very supportive comments private messages donations and generally having my back. I can't even put in words how grateful I am. I'm off to work now. See you tonight hopefully!   -------------------------------------------   Hello /r/dota2.  Today is my last day of Dota 2. For now. Probably for at least two months. Our energy supply is being cut off and I won't be able to play. Or use the computer at all. Or eat a warm meal. Or take a hot shower. Or use the heating during the cold fall.  I don't know why exactly I'm making this post. I guess I just wanna talk about it. As long as I still can.  Many months ago I lost my job which paid decently. I fell back into bad habits. I have been suffering from depression for at least the past 9 years probably way longer. And since I lost that job it's only gotten so much worse. Suicidal thoughts dictate my every day. Ever since I've been living on benefits while working a little in a small restaurant to help pay the bills. Which any person suffering from depression will attest you is very straining.  I still live at home with my sick elderly mother two of my sisters and my six year old niece. I come from a poor family. None of my ten siblings have any noteworthy education. They only speak their mother tongue and struggle with elementary school maths. Some of them work some like my two sisters here at home don't. We asked around for family and friends who could lend us some money just so we could take a breather catch up on our energy bill and get our shit in order. No one helped but one friend of mine. But it's not enough. By tonight I will not have energy at my house. I will only be able to charge my phone during my drive to work two to three times a week.  The best thing about all this: I'm being blamed for it. Apparently according to my family it's all my computer using the energy. Totally not the three very old fridges or the washing machine and dryer running at least twice a day or their three TVs running literally 24/7. Or the lights in the corridors being on every night because they're afraid of stumbling on their way to the toilet. Or their constant heating instead of maybe wearing some warmer clothes. Nope. It's all because of my computer which after five minutes inactivity turns itself off. My computer which only runs when I actually play Dota or watch some show. Which is maybe 20 hours a week at most. The rest of the day I'm either at work or in bed sleeping crying and trying to convince me not to kill myself. And certainly it's my fault for losing my job back then and my fault for suffering from a mental illness that we don't have much money. Can't possibly be the fact that my siblings refuse to work because they wouldn't have the time to care for their SEVEN dogs.  I'm sorry for ranting here. I'm just seriously pissed and sad because of this whole situation. I would LOVE to just move the fuck out but I'm literally the only one taking care of my mother. Everytime I talk about moving away she's emotionally abusing me talking down on me telling me how I'm nothing and will never amount to anything either and couldn't even afford living on my own. The thing is I'm literally the _only one_ in our family who could probably amount to something. I'm the only one who went to the Gymnasium which is the highest form of school education here in Germany. The only one who could in theory visit the university get a degree and a job that pays well. I'm just so fucked in the head because of my depression and anxiety issues. I have been raised into this state of mental illness and now I'm stuck with it. Doctors only offer appointments every six months or so and after every visit I'm on my own for another couple of months. This is all so fucked up.  Anyway I didn't mean to drag you guys down with me. I just wanted to say thanks for reading. And more importantly thanks for giving me something _to read_ and entertaining me everyday. I'm just sad I won't see the Journey Update and won't be able to play Sun Wukong the Monkey King for at least two months until we catch up on our bills... I've been waiting for this since forever. I literally cried during the hero reveal at TI6. I got some professional coaching sessions back when I still had the money for it and I was planning on really starting through on my journey to 6k and beyond. Then I lost the job. And all motivation to play and live.  I hope to see you guys again when all of this is over. Thanks for being you /r/dota2. Thanks for all the shitposts art interesting suggestions for the patch analysis /u/SirBelvedere funny videos cool gifs and even the complaints and frustrated rage posts.  Again sorry for this confused mess of a post.  I'll probably hang around for a while after this post if you wanna comment.    --------------------------------   **Edit**: Wow. I did not expect this to blow up the way it did. Thank you all for your very kind comments and private messages. It means the world. As you can see I still have electricity for the moment. They might still show up today but maybe I'm lucky and they have their hands full and won't make it before tomorrow? Who knows!  Either way I'll try to get back to most of you guys. Again thank you!  And regarding something like a GoFundMe or Patreon like many of you suggested: I'm not sure I feel comfortable accepting money from you guys. On the other hand it would be kind of irresponsible to not at least try. I'll have to think about it. ... And read up on how all of that would actually work.  **Edit 2**: We went to the courthouse the other day and the judge ruled in our favor with an interim injunction meaning the energy company can't cut us off _right now_. This is only temporary though. (I'm sorry for possibly using the wrong terminology here - I'm not too well-versed in law.) http://i.imgur.com/nUh3aka.jpg (Proof) So we're gonna be online over the weekend at least!  **Edit 3**: 101 in 9 hours. Wow. I don't know what to say. You guys have already lifted such a huge burden off my shoulders. I can't thank you enough. I promise I **will** try my best to return the favor. Just not sure yet how.,personal

The Dota Plus UI without buying Dota Plus makes me feel like I'm playing trial version of game.,self.DotA2,I'm not gonna get Dota Plus I'm not a fan of subscription services and it doesn't seem worth it.

After three weeks in the ICU a Cancer patient is asking for one favor.,self.DotA2,EDIT:UPDATE: Oh mai gawddd. Thank you so much /r/dota2 and Reddit for such a great response to my situation! Me and my family have been overwhelmed by the amount of people wishing me good luck and who want to help me out!  I've been contacted by a Valve employee a professional caster and a bunch of fellow Dota 2 fans and Seattleites who are offering me badges! So I am well covered in that department.  If you want to follow my journey through fighting Cancer you can follow me @Fduerme on twitter.   I plan on streaming later tonight (around 5pm PST) to answer some questions at [twitch.tv/ken_domo](http://www.twitch.tv/ken_domo)  Original Post >Hello /r/Dota 2. I'm a 23 year old hardcore Dota 2 player who has never missed an International since it's been in Seattle. A year ago I was diagnosed with Lymphoma in one of the roughest ways. I had to be rushed to the ICU a month after attending Ti4 via helicopter where I was put into a coma for about a three weeks.  >You can see a photo album of my journey so far [here](http://imgur.com/a/h5kuv). (Including a picture of me and purge)  >You can see a small part of my Ti collection [here](http://imgur.com/h1RThFA). Now I'm pretty much at the international. I am currently living in South Lake Union which is 15 blocks away from Key Arena. I unfortunately cannot go this year because of the two transplants I have to undergo literally today. I'm pretty much not going to have an immune system at the time of Ti5 so big crowds is a no-no.  >I love Dota 2 and have spent over a thousand dollars at the secret shop. Not pictured are the T-shirts plushes pins and accessories. Outside of Ti i have probably spent another thousand dollars on just in-game gear and compendiums. I also was an open coach who taught lessons for donations and even worked on an in-game announcer with Earl Alexander who was the voice of Louis from Left 4 Dead. The announcer was unfortunately rejected but that's another story.  >/r/dota2 Valve Gabe anyone. I need one thing from Ti5. A badge. I've worn every Ti badge to every single international and I'm going to be missing this years badge. I want to go to Ti6 and want to be able to still keep on this sort-of pointless tradition that I've been keeping up.  >If you can help a guy out please comment or PM me.  If you still want to donate to my fight go to my [gofundme](http://www.gofundme.com/francoduerme). Or just shoot me a PM.,personal
Open Letter to Dendi from a fanboy,self.DotA2,With all due respect i would like to state that after enduring much repression i decided to express my thoughts on your high-esteem career. I have been a fan of NaVi since TI1 and a proud one at that. I hold pride in stating that i witnessed your ridiculous RUBICK ravages and legendary FOUNTAIN HOOKS live. I have to say it broke my heart when Mr.S4 cancelled your tp. I almost went into depression after watching your street interview right after TI3 finals. These are only a few of the many reasons why it saddens me when NAVI losses a match even today. As a sincere NaVi fan I will forever owe NaVi for all those magical moments and will always believe in the team. However amidst the criticism and mockery I come out to tell you that you have been deprived of the platform that a player of your caliber truly deserve. On behalf of all the fans of NaVi i would like to thank you for your loyalty and devotion to the team but despite our utmost respects i believe it is everyone's view that you have served your time well enough to say goodbye to NaVi and look forward to greater endeavors. It is painful to see a talent like you fade away especially when it could very well be just because of lack of exposure. Having said all that i have i believe you know best for yourself and will support you through thick and thin. Sincerely tier 1 fan. P.S. i tried my best to sound professional..forgive my english.,personal
Enough Memes. I beat unfair bots 1v5 with every single hero (with match IDs),self.DotA2,EDIT: none of the match ID's work I think because I hosted on my computer instead of on valve servers.  Believe what you want : )    It took several months but I did it... I defeated the game 1v5 against unfair bots as every hero.   It started when I found myself in the situation of having copious unscheduled down time at work.  I was allowed to do whatever I wanted as long as I could drop it within 60 seconds to go on a call.  This combined with terrible work wifi made an actual game of DotA impossible.  I found myself playing bot games practicing heroes like invoker and earth spirit.  Eventually someone suggested to me that I try playing 1v5 as it was more of a challenge.  With all of the bots on unfair of course.  I initially thought that the best way to succeed would be to split push with radiance illusions so I chose Alchemist and went to work.  Success left me wondering... is this really the only viable strategy?  Or can other heroes succeed as well?  My next idea was to wait for all 5 of the enemy bots to push together and then destroy them all with one move... This led to playing a largely reactive game as Enigma waiting for the perfect moment to attack with Aghanim's Black Hole midnight pulse and radiance.  I wound up still using the radiance/manta combo to push out lanes.  Again having success with radiance/manta I thought of other natural Radiance heroes.  I chose Doom and then Abaddon and then Axe each time relying on Radiance to win.  The next game I chose sniper and simply rushed Rapier.  With two rapiers and two moonshards the bots couldn't even approach me as I destroyed their base.    At this point the games begin to blur together... some of the high points:  * Earthshaker one shotting bots with enchant totem attacks.  Game ended 62-0  * Realizing bots have no concept of how to play against Techies.  They never bought sentries.  * 1900 gpm as Bounty Hunter this was the only game where I did not lane mid.  This would be the highest GPM of any 1v5 game I played.  Track is the ideal farm accelerator when you get 59 kills in under 30 minutes.  * 64 kills in 26 minutes as Pudge.  This was one of the most fun games I played by far.  * Having 80+ Bloodstone charges on Lion with Aghanims and Octarine.  Being able to cast AoE finger of death every 14 seconds was very satisfying.  Other fun bloodstone games included Skywrath Mage and Ogre Magi.  * 3x rapier Ember Spirit.  3x rapier Nyx Assassin.  3x rapier Crystal Maiden.  * 17:50 win as Huskar.  This was my fastest win I ended 34-1 with 1415 GPM  * 4x Butterfly Mirana.  3x Heart Centaur.  4x Daedalus Kunkka  One Hundred and Eleven games later I can say that I have beaten DotA 1v5 against unfair bots as every single hero (except Pit Lord).  The hardest heroes were Wisp Ancient Apparition and Bane  A big lesson was that any hero can split push with radiance/manta/BoT.    Another lesson was that any hero can carry with enough rapiers and moonshards.  After playing so many Bot games I have some comments about the bots themselves:  As far as general bot behavior it's incredibly predictable and abusable.  * whichever bot is mid will go for the top rune ten seconds before it spawns... regardless of its health or your positioning or your ability to kill it.  In most matchups I would aim to kill the bot when it went for the 2 minute and 4 minute rune and after that I was snowballing so hard I would kill it easily.  * Bots have NO idea how to deal with aura damage (radiance ion shell).  If they are caught out in the open with this they will run away from the damage source rather than run towards safety.  It's easy to simply chase bots until they die to the radiance burn.  * AI breaks down when you break into their base.  Maybe they have a waypointing system that doesn't know what to do if an enemy is in their base?  In any case they will often rally to in between their T4 and T3 and just stand there while you kill their base.  * Don't care about protecting their throne.  Will literally run to lanes to farm while it is taking damage.  Same for barracks though they do tend to protect towers.  * Can easily be put into retreat! mode.  If they are taking enough damage they will run away rather than use abilities that would keep them alive.  The only exception to this seems to be shadowblade they love running away with shadowblade.  Some comments about the specific hero behavior:  * Axe: Generally useless.  Mostly spams battle hunger.  Every once in a while will farm a blink dagger successfully but it is rare.  * Bane: the single scariest support bot.  Unfair bots have no issue 5 man ganking you with fiend's grip.  Tends to farm necronomicon.  * Bounty Hunter: sometimes will just forget to escape with invis.  Generally useless.  * Bloodseeker: absolutely terrible at laning using bloodrage on himself at all times.  Rupture is still one of the better bot ultimates and will kill you if you don't expect it when the bots 5 man.  * Bristleback: his scariest tendency is to spam goo while tower diving you.  In a couple games he got truly out of hand with vanguard/blademail/heart.  One of the better bots.  * Chaos Knight: by far the scariest carry bot.  4 second stun enough said.  Also he builds armlet/heart and will destroy your base if he isn't kept under control.  The most important bot to gank mercilessly.  * Crystal Maiden: almost completely useless.  Occasionally she will disable you or use her ultimate but generally she dies too quickly and is just food.  * Dazzle: casts shallow grave effectively.  That's about it.  * Death Prophet: very bad at using spirit siphon.  But she will use exorcism to destroy your base if you let her.  She will also use exorcism immediately before dying.  Really bad AI on this bot.  * Dragon Knight: he will stun you and occasionally turn into a dragon.  But he never gets the items or the farm to make his hero actually matter.  * Drow Ranger: she will spam frost arrows on you in team fights and seems to use her silence more than death prophet does.  Always builds into shadowblade which is annoying.  Probably the best ranged carry bot.  Nowhere near as scary as Chaos Knight though.  * Earthshaker: he's good for a fissure and that's it.  Will sometimes echo slam but usually not.  * Jakiro: moderately scary just because he will use liquid fire on towers and push them faster than other bots.  He also buys a mek almost every game and consistently lands icepaths if you don't try to dodge them.  One of the better support bots but he's not going to kill you like Bane bot is.  * Juggernaut: He can be scary when he remembers to use omnislash but I still don't understand when he will/won't omnislash it seems random.  Never farms enough to matter outside of his ultimate and healing ward.  * Kunkka: He's bad at landing torrents but he's great at landing X.  X will get you killed more than any other non-ultimate bot ability.  With that said he never farms any meaningful items.  Just beware of X.  * Lich: useless  * Lina: VERY bad at landing her stun.  And she will use laguna blade.  Pretty easy to just kill her though and she never farms defensive items.    * Lion: when he remembers to stun you he's scary.  Most of the time his AI gets stuck on retreat! and he forgets to cast his abilities.  Never farms a blink dagger either.  * Luna: unlike Juggernaut she reliably casts her ultimate and will kill you.  Unlike human Luna players she never farms up big items.    * Necrophos: another bot that is basically a walking ultimate.    * Omniknight: useless.  Never uses his abilities properly  * Oracle: worse than useless he tends to heal you more than damage you and never uses his abilities in the correct order.  False promise always just delays death by 5 seconds as he never heals the target during the duration.    * Phantom Assassin: mostly useless but even without items PA can get some big crits and surprise you.  Best not to let her get to level 16.  * Pudge: he's decent at landing a hook and then dismembering you... if you're standing still.  He's terrible at predicting hooks like a human player would and is easily baited into missing his hook.  The most annoying thing about this hero is his ability to suicide and deny you kills.  * Razor: useless.  Is not aggressive in lane uses his ultimate randomly barely tries to maintain static links.  * Sandking: consistently stuns you.  I don't think he ever used epicenter properly though.  * Shadowfiend: I have never seen anyone miss so many shadowrazes.  He will fire them randomly and in the complete wrong direction often turning away from creeps to cast one.  I am literally shocked whenever a raze hit me.  Never buys shadowblade/blink/euls or any other item that would actually matter.  Never uses ultimate aggressively.  Definitely the easiest bot to lane against and the easiest to kill in the first 2 minutes of the game.  * Skywrath Mage: generally just a feeder.  Never buys any survivability.  Mystic Flare is a lot of damage if he manages to cast it while you are stunned otherwise he always misses it.  * Sniper: like drow he always buys shadowblade.  But he is much worse than drow incredibly easy to kill and to just keep too poor to matter.  * Sven: scary when he casts god's strength and then clicks on your base.  Mostly harmless otherwise.  * Tidehunter: rarely uses Ravage... I think his AI makes hiim want to save it for more than one enemy which erally hurts him in a 1v5 scenario.  Pretty much a fat melee creep.  * Tiny: does not know how to combo.  Doesn't buy blink or Aghs.  Just a walking stun for the most part.  * Vengeful Spirit: she WILL swap you into her team.  One of the scarier ultimates if the bots group up and push.  * Viper: moderately annoying to lane against but I think Valve toned down his aggressive last hitting because it honestly was never that bad.  Doesn't aggressively slow you like bristleback will which is weird considering he has 3 slows.  * Warlock: heals teammates throughout the game.  That's all he does.  * Windranger: easy to bait out windrun rarely uses focus fire on heroes occasionally lands shackles.  * Witchdoc: one of the only bots that casts his combo consistently will try to cask/maledict/deathward every time he sees you.  But never farms shadowblade/bkb so it's always easy to kill him.  * Wraithking: A stun that can't miss and a tendency to build armlet.

Dota 2 comes through,self.DotA2,Ive had a rough past couple of years. Parents died to drug addiction Fiance left me to chase better things joined the army to have a decent life but the one thing that has always provided me an escape was Dota 2. I see too many posts on here about how Dota is ruining lives well today it saved one. Not one single family member called me to wish me happy birth day or hell even post on Facebook but Ill always have Dota 2 mates that pull through.   Thanks for being such an awesome Dota 2 community. The content on here is what keeps me going   Edit: Im humbled by your response. Just to show how awesome r/dota2 is. Thanks for making my day Im gonna remember this one.,personal
As a thirld world gamer I've a very small feature request to valve,self.DotA2,Pleeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaase bring back net_graph. My internet connect is unreliable and I'm very reliant on knowing if I can play with my connection or not. Before reborn was released I had a simple method. I would spectate a live game and if the ping fluctuation was below 30ms (represented by ping  fluctuation) that means I can play properly.   The one option we have currently is way less detailed. It does not update properly gets blocked by the UI in some custom games (like overthrow). It also does not show the upload/download rate of the game.  I know most of you do not care about this and have no interest whatsoever. Maybe I'm the only guy who wants this. But please this means a lot to me. Very rarely my ping would spike for a few seconds during a game and I would immediately know that I've to take that into consideration in my decision making at that moment. (Btw this has not actually affected my skills a lot and I've adjusted to it. I'm 3.4k if it matters.)  Unfortunately this is not a shitpost. This is my humble request to everyone to not downvote this if you don't agree with me or are not interested in this (all my other posts have been).  I've been trying to contact Valve through the dev forums and other means but I've received no reply as of yet. Maybe this will get buried as well but I'm trying.,personal

I can't stand the treasure 3 complaints anymore,self.DotA2,Please give it a rest.  You aren't going to start a boycott reddit complained about the drop rates from last years immortals also this isn't new.  To all the people comparing their drops this year to previous years... 30-50 spins is not even close to a sufficient sample size!  The fact you didn't get what you wanted doesn't mean escalating odds are broken the odds don't magically turn into 100% after your 30 spins.  Also there's no rule that valve can't change their odds there are F2P/P2W games out there that have far worse odds and absolutely no information for drop rates.  These are skins/outfits they give no advantage or disadvantage in game by owning them and it seems extremely reasonable for a F2P game.   I buy the battle pass because the whole package makes the game more fun for me and makes TI more enjoyable skins are cool but I'm certainly not buying this just for the cool sword sven has.  Does everyone else buy their battle pass strictly for these immortal treasures? Most of these posts lately sound like they're coming from 13 year olds who just lost money at a casino asking for a refund because they didn't know the odds and didn't win what they expected.,personal
"To the pros who keep saying ""I'm sorry I let everyone down""",self.DotA2,"This keeps coming up again and again and I just want to say this.  How is it you think we see you? Why do you think we follow you? Only ever to watch you win?  Are we rats that jump ship the minute it starts to sink? Switch loyalty to the winning players?  I have a smile on my face to watch your amazing plays that most of us could only ever dream of making. Sometimes I smile so much watching DOTA that my face hurts. I get so excited that I shout.  I do not care if cynical people think this is kissing ass it's about what's true and I have never in my life lost love for my favourite pros because they lose games and tourneys.  If you sat on your ass if you didn't try that would let us down.  If you were too smug and thought you didn't have to prepare properly that would let us down.  But none of you do you strategise you work like crazy and you play like gods out of your mind and to me personally you bring nothing but joy.  I just needed to say this because every time I see someone who makes me happy just to watch them play say ""I'm sorry I let everyone down"" it breaks my fucking heart.",personal

Today a Crystal Maiden player donated me his Tomb of Knowledge,self.DotA2,"He innocently said in his SEA native tongue ""hayz!"" and called attention towards himself. Poor guy had been disconnected for half of the laning stage. He walked towards me wearing just some brown boots carrying a bunch of sentries and a tomb of knowledge. Took him a while to catch up to my Terrorblade speeding away using the Yasha and BoTs. He innocently handed the tomb to me and just walked away.  I was left speechless. This was the first time I had been given a tomb to use. A tomb that a guy bought using about a fifth of his networth. And I didn't even acknowledge him running after me since a minute I was too busy microing my illusions.   I just couldn't bring myself to use it. It felt wrong.   I went and put the item back into his inventory. He wrote a ""no"" followed by ""use it"" and again gave it to me. I said ""its just a game my friend enjoy it"". I dragged it over his hero and teleported away.   He stood there for the next 10 seconds. That was perhaps the first time he had been respected and treated as an equal. He knew he had fucked up he was more or less a liability to us in the laning phase but that tomb was a reminder of the fact that he too was a fellow Dota 2 player that too one from SEA where disconnects are frequent.   He never used it. It was in his inventory in the post-game screen. He kept it as some sort of a trophy which he had earned.",personal
For 905 hours my friend has played fully zoomed.,self.DotA2,"My friend has been playing for about a year he tends to be our 5th or 6th man when it comes to queuing due to his mediocre dota skills. Just today our stack was playing a usual pub and we dumped him on the support ogre role (his usual position). It was about 15 minutes into to the game and our ogre said in mumble ""you can zoom out!?!?!"". We replied by saying that you can only zoom out in spectator mode. Me and everyone else was a little bit confused with the zoom out discussion. Then one of our friends casually mentioned that you can only zoom out if you're zoomed in. Still a bit confused my friend asked if they added zooming out in 6.84 (He never reads the patch notes). Then realization hit him. He reluctantly brought up the idea that maybe he had been playing zoomed in for his entire dota career. Me and my entire stack were initially in disbelief about this. And as we started to look back at things it became more and more clear that he truly had been playing fully zoomed for all of his 900 hours. Here is a list of things we realized while playing the match.  - He calibrated at 1.7k solo mmr and has stayed their ever since - He is inept at last hitting (when zoomed in the creeps are clumped) - He often struggles at finding people in teamfights to stun - He has surprisingly good map awareness he mentioned that he uses the minimap a lot as a substitute to lack of vision. - He also has a problem where he doesn't like to buy wards. During the match he explained that he thought they were useless because he could not see out of his small area of vision.  If you haven't ever seen what being fully zoomed in is like it's kind of like playing smite but much much worse. We were still shocked amazed and yet still in disbelief about this so we asked him some questions for proof. We asked if he had ever watched any pro matches on twitch and he said that he thought that only spectator mode looked like that. Another thing we wondered about is how he had never accidentally zoomed out. Apparently his old mouse never had a scroll wheel and he just got a new one this week. Looking back on it he could have been a much better dota player. To us he just seemed to be on a slow learning curve. Now I wonder how many more matches we would have won if he was zoomed out. Here is his dotabuff if you were wondering -http://www.dotabuff.com/players/153051755  Edit 1 - There has been a lot of questions regarding on how he zoomed in in the first place. I just talked to him. When he first started playing he used on of those apple mouses that don't have a scroll wheel. Instead you scroll by rubbing your fingers upwards. So he believes that in one of his first games he scrolled upwards yet never changed it. He then later disabled the rub upwards scroll feature because it interfered with games like minecraft. And now he has a new mouse  Edit 2 - Thank you to /u/nihlushall13 for showing how zoomed in he played http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/522763483074623760/B9DC77E6BF1BC9B44F1D649EFF16A50EC67BB131/  Edit 3 - For those wondering how he has a 54% winrate we 5 stack all the time and he plays position 5 supports. We play fairly well as a team so we tend to win a bit ",personal
Casting your games to help afford my trip to TI,self.DotA2,With the announcement of TI this year and tickets going on sale this week I thought it was time to post this.  I am looking to help fund my trip to TI by casting your pub games (or maybe even your battles pass tournaments too!)  I have never been to TI and I am desperately looking to attend but it is usually too expensive for me and I just can never afford the trip tickets lodging food etc.  So what I'm looking to do is cast your games for at least 10 dollars a game (or any amount more if you want) or battle pass tournament runs for a different price but I haven't thought of it yet because it could be one game it could be three.  - Basically you email me at Bkopcasting@gmail.com tell me which game/s you want cast.  - I'll download the game so it doesn't dissapear on me and I can cast it  - Then you PayPal me as soon as you can doesn't have to be immediately just when you do is when I'll get to casting the game  - Finally I'll cast the game back and I'll email you a private listing on YouTube to the game and if you want me to make it public I will.  If you want me to stream it on my [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/bkopcasting) I can do that do and then post it to YouTube too.  So yea in conclusion I'm trying to afford TI by casting your pubs or battle pass games. Hope all is well and hope to see you all at TI  Edit: just wanted to let you all know that I will also most likely start casting requested games after DPL and possibly after passover(having a lot of family over doing a lot of cooking and well don't want to keep people up either) but there is a lot of time until ti and I work as hard as possible to cast every single game!

Battle Cup Revenge,self.DotA2,"So last night was my first crack at Battle Cup.  I started to frantically look for a team with an hour and a half until registration began.   I got invited into a party which was now full with the inclusion of me they ask what role I preferred and I said I play best in the position 1 or 2.  They all laughed at me and started being complete ass holes stating to kick me and that nobody with my MMR (which is 2.6k) will be carrying their team.   Mind you this is fucking tier 3.... so not the greatest skill level. They had high opinions of themselves shoving their high 3000s MMR in my face and putting me down. Then continued to complain and sook also stating ""if you don't kick him im leaving""   I just decided to leave and make my own team...   I'll try make this short I ended up constructing a team where everyone was suited to their roles and MMR was never even asked about. I captained this team into the grand final where we faced the ass holes that be littled me. I shared this story to my team as motivation and we slaughtered them claiming my first ever battle Cup and a bunch of new friends I can play with often!   I can't wait until next week and I am sorry if this story didn't interest you but I felt like instead of talking smack after beating these ass holes I'd come to Reddit and share a nice experience. (This can be my way to stick it up them)   EDIT: Ok so I made an error my tier was 3 not 4! Also we've found out that the plebs who abused me weren't even in the 3000s MMR they just lied about it for some reason.    https://www.dotabuff.com/players/84047410/matches   ",personal
I need help to get payout from sale of items in steam Workshop...,self.DotA2,Hello guys I was a Dota 2 amateur Tournament admin back in time once it was really a thing. I spent lots of my time and efforts and conducted some tournaments successfully. From sale of tickets of these tournaments I made some money (although it is very less but still...). I had to get that money out from my steam workshop account to my back account. There was no way (automatic) to get that money so I contacted steam support via a ticket. They generically referred me to a support topic. I replied to that topic and from then onward steam is silent. Here is a screenshot of that ticket;  https://imgur.com/a/8IZDJ  So now I cant open a closed ticket because its more than 30 days old and there is no way to contact steam about it. They say they automatically make payments but interestingly I have not received even a single penny till now.   So I would request help from community to please tell me how to proceed ? Specially ones who work with steam workshop that how do I get a payout from my workshop account.  Thanks a lot and sorry for bad English.,personal

This is coming from a former plat LoL player top 50 raid tank in WoW/2.2k arena rating winner of Super Smash Bros melee tournaments(TLDR;Nothing special but somebody who's done plenty of competitive gaming) and I can't get over how overwhelming this game is.  Like props to you guys I really wish I was younger(time) because this seems like so much fun to get into but something you just have to dedicate time to learning.  Like I start with EVERY CHAMP WHAT.  There's a courier?!  You kill your own minions and zomg secret shops and stuff.

Open letter to Valve & Dota2 Community | About Match-fixing and SA Scene,self.DotA2,Hello my name is Bryan Freddy Machaca Sia  also known as Smash. As many of you know I have been pulled apart indefinitely from Valves competitive scene. Up to now It's been almost two years since the ban was announced and I feel like it's time to write a letter explanining lots of details that are still unknown by many of the public. I'd like to clarify that this text doesnt meant to create feelings of pity towards me or my teammates nor even justify my actions. I just think that after two years its fair that you guys know the full story and that we arent really bad people.   First of all I'd like to publicly apologize to Valve. I'd like to sincerely apologize for any trouble that we have caused to their organization and for tarnishing the names of pro players everywhere with our actions. Valve has always seeked to promote sportsmanship and fair play and our actions didnt reflect those values.   Secondly I'd like to apologize to all the members of the Dota community. Players our fans professional players organizations and all of those amazing people that compose this beautiful community did not deserve the trouble that we caused them and for that we sincerely apologize. I hate and blame myself for being such a naive person and for not fully realizing the consequences and magnitude of our actions at the time.   Currently I have been banned for almost two years from the competitive scene. It is frustrating you know? Not being able to compete in the game you love the most. I dont wish this feeling even to the worst of my enemies; watching your dreams fell down because of your own dumb actions due to immaturity inexperience and the lack of proper advice. It stopped me from reaching my dreams and from pursuing a career that Im truly passionate in.   Maybe now its too late to be talking about this but I never had the space or the opportunity to do it before. I was always terrified of saying or doing something as I thought this would only make the situation turn worst and that people would not believe my words. Now two years have passed. Maybe the hardest years of my life in fact but a time that helped me mature in many aspects nonetheless. Living every day of your life acknowledging that you have been banned from your passion is a hard thing and it took me very long to accept this fact. Now though having fully accepted my current situation Id like to explain the circumstances that led to the events in question.   Back in the days we were a group of youngsters that had a common goal - being professional Dota players and playing against the best. Back then saying these kind of things seemed like a joke as everyone simply watched the videos posted by legengs like LodA Vigos or Yaphets (thanks to them I started professionally) and revered them as gods or something simply unachievable. However this view we had changed when we formed our first team. We wanted to improve to become as good or if possible better than they were.   For this common goal I dedicated years of my life to this game and made many sacrifices along the way to follow my passion. One of these sacrifices were the ties to my family. I lived in a province that is quite far from the peruvian capital called Tacna. Tacna simply did not have the players or the tournaments to sustain my dream so not even a decent internet connection. Because of this I was forced to move to the capital. However due to the lack of economic resources in my family I had to go there alone and sustain myself. There was simply no chance of playing from Tacna as the competitive level I was playing against was huge and I needed a proper training.   At first gaming in Peru was not easy whatsoever. In 2013 there were no organizations that supported players that wanted to be professionals; only cyber cafes/lan centers and small teams formed by friends. Nobody wanted to invest in Esports in Per and many players had to live off their own savings. However when I was in my first team Artyk Gaming we were lucky enough to get a small space to play lent to us thanks to a friend of ours. Many teams back then lived in deplorable conditions from little to no earnings but that did not break the passion and commitment we had with Dota 2. Everything was quite harsh for me and my fellow teammates especially since we all came to the capital from different parts of Peru. We were alone and we didnt use to socialize with other people either. It was hard as many days we were unable to fulfill basic necessities. There were even days where my teammates and I had no food to eat and no place to sleep. These kind of mishaps though helped us bond and created a very strong and united team. We survived all of this because we had a common goal - becoming a powerful team with global presence that could represent the Latin American community and further the improvement of such a community.   To be honest I regret not speaking about this before as many people believe that our actions held malicious intent or that we were attempting to take advantage of a bunch of people. Most people werent aware of our living conditions at the time or even now.   Two years ago our economic situation wasnt particularly great and that is why we decided to leave the Not Today organization to seek a better future. Before we left however the owner of Not Today asked that we return all the money that he had invested in us. I dont know how much he asked for from each individual player but I know he asked me that I needed to return all the money I made from the MVP title I won at The Summit 2 by Beyond the Summit tournament (10K dollars). I was very nave as I could only think about one thing and that was playing Dota. I was unaware of how a proper gaming organization functioned - how our earnings were handled how they dealt with sponsors etc. Its due to this that I was scammed many times maybe even more times and I don't know about it. But in that time I believed that it was all good that I could simply win more money by playing more - a big mistake. Even today I regret not fighting for that money I had to give.   After so many incidents we decided it was a best idea to play independently and a friend of ours luckily allowed us to use his basement to practice. Yep no fancy house just a small damp basement. On top of that due to Perus terrible and unstable internet we had two options - pay large amounts of money for a good connection or stick to a bad connection and somehow make it work. We obviously chose the second option as we simply didnt have the money and tried to make it work. Again the money was an inconvenience because the little money we had saved up from our trips was depleting and we were running out of money for food.   This is when we decided to seek a new organization to represent us so that we could at least have a stable diet (and by stable I mean eating every day). That is when we finally joined Elite Wolves and it was good for a while. I had a salary of $90 which was quite a lot for the time. Back then a peruvian proplayer earned between 30-90$ a month (and 90 was still a fringe value reserved for those that  were lucky enough to find a generous organization). Sadly with that amount of money we could not cover the basics. Especially regarding food. Most days we ate cold cereal or whatever we could muster. Most people thought that we made tons of cash but they are now starting to realize that this is simply not true and we did not live the lavish life that everyone said we did. It seems like a dumb clarification but it is important to note that it was a huge sacrifice to be a pro player in Peru back in the day. At the end of the day we kept at it because it was what we loved to do and the sacrifice was worth it.   Many organizations back in the day made a good amount of money and they took advantage of the talent and navete of many players. Nobody ever said anything because it might hurt one's career to speak out and they cant predict the communitys reaction but at this point I think everyone deserves to know the truth. We fought with tooth and nail to improve the conditions of pro players in the Peruvian community and we gave it our all so that we could accomplish our dreams.   This leads to another problem. When the match fixing scandal occurred it was our manager someone with whom we had had many problems in the past who spoke to Valve exclusively. He was one of the many people that took advantage of our lack of experience and we still had a couple unsolved monetary issues with him as well. To this day I am still unsure what kind of communication he held with Valve but we never had the opportunity to express our version of the story.   There were many things that motivated our team to match-fix. Theres a point when you are close to shutting down due to desperation that you start to make bad decisions. Some people in the team had no money for food or to live on and what little we had to share was not enough to help them. I was not the one who coordinated the matchfixing as I would have never been able to incite or motivate others to take such decisions. The truth is that I just followed my teammates even if I didnt agree with them. That was my worst mistake and it led me to being involved with something that ruined my career.   I have always been an introverted person but I was recognized due to my Dota prowess and the advancements I made in the community. That is why people started to follow me and the hispanic community gave me a lot of their love. Some people still hold to that positive feeling to this day despite everything that happened.   We have a great community that supports us not just from Peru but from many Hispanic and non Hispanic countries as well. The support from these people and their words of encouragement are what help me keep going as a competitive player in Dota 2.   I dont look to excuse myself in front of your eyes I am only writing this so that everyone understands the conditions that pro-gamers lived under in Peru. I want people to acknowledge that back then organizers took advantage of players due to their lack of experience and ignorance.   Recently this has changed but only slightly. Many organizations dont say anything but they continue to exploit players and those who seek retributions are quickly swept under the rug. We were at the forefront of the e-sports movement in Peru and we wanted to open a path for the community to follow so that nobody would have to live under our conditions or suffer the exploitation that we suffered.   We were also the first Peruvian team to gain international recognition. We hoped despite our failings that we could help our community grow to the point that itd be recognized as a powerhouse internationally for all the untapped talent that is still present here.   We are glad to see that new Peruvian players have managed to participate in big tournaments such as The International as it is a dream that we all share here but we also feel frustrated at our inability to complete for the same dream.    In case many of you are wondering we continue to play to this day and we compete in the few tournaments that allow us to participate. We dedicate ourselves entirely to these tournaments but every day there are stronger and better prepared teams as more and more teams are able to compete internationally.   These past two years we have fought against our own frustration for being sanctioned. Many people promised to help us like the organization Thunder Awaken (the last team we were a part of). In the end they were little more than snake oil vendors who did not stick to their word. We didnt publicly state this as some people still hope that one day our ban will be revoked. However I have to continue forward but my emotional stability is depleting. My skill level has decreased mainly due to the lack of motivation I feel due to being banned and I wish you guys understood how hard it is for one to do their best with that burden on their mind. Sometimes I even think that in our last tournament The Final Match we could have performed better. We did what we could given our situation. Recently though Ive met many people that been trying to guide me and that have cheered me on to continue improving and fighting for what I love.   Currently I stream daily on Twitch. When I stream I teach and share my experience to whomever wants to listen. I offer classes to casual players I share my matches ...  Essentially I do whatever I can to continue to support  the community that has given us so much over the years. I love Dota and it is my only passion. I have not stopped playing Dota a single day since I was banned.   My last goal was to achieve 10k MMR before the ranked system changed to the new one. I fought day in and day out to achieve this goal. I fought against myself against my own frustration and I just try to carry on with my life. I was really close to the goal buy I didnt make it. I would love it if you guys could continue to support me in my journey.   Finally before I conclude this letter Id like you guys to know that every word written in this statement comes accompanied with the grief that I feel. They are written from the heart and soul of a proplayer whose goals are no longer possible but who dares to dream and keeps his hopes up for a miracle some day.   Many people have told me to leave Dota aside. They said I should start a new path elsewhere. I dont know I love Dota and I dont think its possible for me to leave it. I will give everything I have until I am physically forced to step aside to continue with my life outside of Dota. Regardless I dont want anyone to think ill of me or my team.   For now we are young but in a couple years we will be old. Events like these are the ones that truly make you mature and realize that a single decision can drastically impact your life. I have many dreams and goals that have become unachievable due to this ban. This is why Im asking you if this letter reaches anyone from Valve please consider lifting or setting a time limit for my ban. I apologize profusely for all the trouble caused both to Valve and to the community as a whole and I will continue regreting my decision the rest of my life regardless of what occurs going forward.   With this letter I pray that those who know me and those who dont understand the reality of Esports and organizations in Peru. I also hope you understand the nature of my actions and what factors motivated me to commit them. More importantly though I hope that this letter reaches someone with dreams akin to mine and it motivates him to pursue them as we are all dreamers at heart. I know that with this letter we wont make all the hatred disappear but I hope that those who hate us blindly at least question their feelings before doing so.   Thank you   Bryan Freddy Machaca Sia SmasH  contact@smashdota.com,personal

'Free to Play' was on ESPN and my dad got curious,self.DotA2,"He started asking so many questions like ""is this the game you play all the time?"" ""How do you play it?"" and I had to think for a second on how I could explain about all the intricacies of Dota such as the heroes their roles farming and etc. Then I thought of a better solution. I said "" Why don't you follow me and watch it at one of the pubstomps this coming week?"" He said ""Won't that be weird since I'll be the only old guy there?""   I've been watching football with my dad since I was 7 but I can't believe I get to say I'll be watching Dota with my dad :')  EDIT : It was on Astro Supersport instead of ESPN my bad.",personal

6 boys from Slovakia looking for accommodation for ESL One Katowice,self.DotA2,Hello we are 6 friends from Slovakia and Katowice should have been our very first event. Unfortunately our AirBnB got canceled just now and we can't find suitable replacement (either very far away or too expensive).  We only want to go from 23.-25. february. We are all males from 21 to 23 years old. We can offer around 50-60 euro per night. (We have ranks from Archon to Divine 5 rank 900 if anyone is interested lol) If you anyone from Katowice could help us somehow we would very much appreciate it. You can coment here or PM me.  Thank you  Edit: thanks for the upvotes we didnt really expect it and we really appreciate it. Those of you who suggest that it is easy to find AirBnB or something else with 50-60 euro per night we would be really thankful if you posted link too because we really tried finding stuff before posting this here.   Edit2: Thank you guys for everything we tried most links you posted herebut most are full when we contacted them during those dates some are still too expensive and some have very strict policy (you need to come before 22:00 which we probably wouldnt be able to do). So the search still continues ! But we really appreciate all your efforts. Thank you!!,personal

Help! Disqualified from sea qualifiers for bizzare reason.,self.DotA2,We recently secured an invite to the LAN finals of the [New Blood Championship 2017(in Jakarta Indonesia](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/events/717-new-blood-championships-2017)). But got an email stating that we got disqualified for a bullsh*t reason. tl;dr at bottom   A bit of a backstory: We are Team Nomadic a young Mongolian team that competed in the NBC 2017 Rest of SEA open qualifiers and finished second place which directly qualifes us for the Main event as started in the rules.  The tournament itself is aimed at 'up and coming' dota amateur teams and banned tier 1 sea teams. It has several regional qualifiers for countries like Philippines Vietnam etc and 1 Open qualifiers for the rest of the sea teams.(Also note that those countries could enter the rest of sea Open qualifiers too effectively having 2 qualifiers)  [The admins sent an email notifying us of our apparent disqualification 3 days ago claiming that were not based from the Sea region](https://i.imgur.com/rcmnVLi.png) which is quite a ridiculous statement for a lot of reasons;   Firstly Mongolian teams have historically always competed in the Sea region of any kind of qualifers. Which is quite understandable for anyone with basic geography knowledge or when any Mongolian dota player opens the client and glances at the pings (fyi its~90 for Singapore ~120 Luxembourg and ~100 for the empty Japan server) Also they included The Mongolz in their banned Tier 1 players and teams section. which is a Mongolian team which they now claim is not a part of SEA. But it's most ridiculous when you realise that even Valve themselves invited Mongolian teams to the Sea regional qualifiers of their events!.  The rules never stated the countries that they deem SEA region their rules even included a mongolian team in their ban-list further confirming that mongolia is rightfully a part of the sea dota region.  [Last month we qualified for the Asus Rog masters Apac without any issues.](https://i.imgur.com/EJqk1ZF.png)  If we aren't a Sea team which region do we even belong to?  We are all young players(aged 17-23) that are sacrificing a shitton for a small chance of going pro and getting denied this huge opportunity is real dick punch for us. Especially considering that we qualified against a hundred+ teams fair 'n square and this tournament was supposed to be aimed at exactly players like us for aspiring Dota 2 players to shine and showcase their talents. taken directly from their website. http://newbloodchampionships.com  Please help us recover our hard earned slot we don't know what else to do now.  p.s english is not my first language(nor second) so please ignore typos etc  tl;dr Sea based team got disqualified after winning sea open qualifiers for not being sea based.  https://i.imgur.com/qKtQI63.png Chat with admin   https://www.toornament.com/tournaments/638474229924429824/stages/638474746528464896/ tournament brackets   https://i.imgur.com/beYrdfi.png Semi final win,personal

XiiTuzi blog @ Shanghai Major,self.DotA2,For those who dont know I am Helen XiiTuzi Xu and I work as a freelance translator for DOTA2 events. I worked at many events in the past few years including TI3 to 5 MLG Columbus Redbull Battleground Nanyang Frankfurt Major and more. I attended Shanghai Major as a translator but ended being a part-time host and helped with managing some of the issues later on. Things Im about to write are my first hand experiences of this event and I hope to share with you. Honestly its a scary thing for me to do because Im really afraid that tournament organizers will dislike me for this and wont invite me to future tournaments. Other tournaments had problems too but I felt the need to write about this tournament in particular because the problems are on a different scale.     Lets start with invites. People talked about talent invites so you can dig that up yourself but originally Jack and I were not on the translators invite list (this was confirmed by a Perfect World staff). It was bizarre to me that I wasnt invited because I have the most experience working at Chinese events. Jack was the on-stage interpreter for ESL ONE New York Frankfurt Major and the last MDL. Jack and I were added to the list later on after people from the community talked to PW.  When I saw the invite email it said my daily salary would be 500RMB/day thats a third of my normal salary rate and all translators were to be paid 500RMB/day. I ignored that because I was so happy that I can be a part of the event even if PW were to pay me nothing I wouldve still went considering that I wasnt even invited in the first place.     Upon arrival to Shanghai I was happy to finally land after a 12-hour flight from San Francisco and to see familiar faces. I arrived late at night to find out media days begin the next morning with first team leaving at 7:30AM. I was told that I would be needed to help with western teams but the managers werent even notified about this beforehand. The photo-shoot location was a 35-minute drive away without traffic (an hour during peak hours) but normally these kinds of shoots are done within the hotel where players are staying. Complexity was scheduled as the first team but they refused to go that early so they were scheduled to a later time of the day. MVP actually left the hotel at 8AM the next day. Information was given at a very slow rate and if information was wrong or changed we normally have to chase after PW staff for the correct ones.     Group stage matches were often delayed due to technically difficulties. The two incidents I remember very clearly were Secret switching rooms and Spirit audio issues. Secret had their gears in one of the battle room the night before and tested everything except audio. One would assume with gears already set up match would start on time but Secret was asked to switch to a different room for their first match because PW and production made a mistake of which game would be casted on main stream.  During the match Secret had audio issues with the intercom system where you can hear yourself talking or weird loud noises randomly. Window system for everyone was in Chinese but western players requested to have English versions installed so the tech team reinstalled the systems but with bootleg copies and no drivers were installed. The intercom system they used for the event was very faulty but even so most teams did not use Team Speak during the event because of Service Pack issues from reinstallation of Windows and no drivers were pre-installed. According to the tech dude the intercom system sometimes damages the files on SSD (hes really cool but I didnt catch his name everyone around just called him   shi fu).     For Spirit vs. Vici the game was already paused for 20 minutes by the time I walked pass their battle room and got grabbed in to help translate.  Under frustration with the intercom system Team Spirit switched to Team Speak and Iceberg had audio issues; it literally took 5 people an hour to fix the issue. Relating to the intercom issue Im sure many of you remember that loud screaming in the background during Mushis interview. In the middle of the interview someone screamed really loudly in Chinese and everyone just got startled. I found out after that it was one of the PW higher ups screaming at the intercom tech guy saying that he doesnt want to hear any more problems. Other staffs gave him the nickname Captain Useless because he gave 0 contribution to helping situations. The day after screaming he wanted to call all the team managers into a meeting at 11PM just so he can formally apologize some PW staffs talked him out of it because seriously who gives a fuck about him in the first place.     Before talking about English production for Shanghai Major I want to give you a background of KeyTV and Nanyang Cup English production. KeyTV consisted of Chinese speaking staff while talents only speak English. There were awkward transitions where the panel would say lets hand it off to the casters and the camera doesnt cut to casters until 5 seconds later. The reason for this was that whenever the production team gave a queue to the talents or vice versa a translator translated the message to the other party making communication extremely inefficient and confusing.     When KeyTV came in to the Shanghai Major they said the equipment provided was bad and so they brought in some of their own mainly wireless headsets. During the first two days of group stage there were already conflicts between KeyTV MarsTV PW and Valve. Person in charge of KeyTV refused to talk to anyone from the MarsTV production team and whenever a problem needed to be solved a PW or Valve staff would have to step in to supervise. Keep in mind that only the Chinese stream has immediate access to player camera feeds during matches so it was crucial that other streams keep in touch with MarsTV who was doing the Chinese production.     This happened around 8:30AM and streams needed to be live before 9AM. When KeyTV were initially told that they would no longer be responsible for English production around 7:30AM they lingered around trying to talk to Valve staffs ultimately KeyTV were told to leave and when they finally left they took all their equipment with them. On top of that the person in charge of KeyTV ripped some documents (mainly English versions of rundown and schedules) in front of us claiming that those were their work because Bonnie translated those and Bonnie worked for them. They were even pushing Bonnie to leave with them but Im glad she decided to stay and help. After KeyTV left English production team on that day consisted of Thad and Bruno from Valve Bonnie Rob and Bryan from BTS and a sound guy we borrowed from MarsTV. Talents and casters used worse equipment than what KeyTV had. The next day another group of Chinese production came in to take over and we got better microphones but that was pretty much it. Bonnie still had to translate for the production team.     During the two break days after group stage I was told that there would be rehearsal on the day before main event. Production teams were to go to the venue at 7AM to set up technical rehearsal at 3PM then general rehearsal at 7PM. It was around 6PM when I got notified that technical rehearsal didnt even happen yet. So guess what rehearsal was cancel all together.     First day of main event I showed up at the venue at 8:30AM but was told that I wont have a badge. A PW staff took me inside the venue and left me at the make up room. I was stuck there for at least 2 hours. Although there were several other translators available I found out I was scheduled for translating post match interviews the entire day while Jack were to sub in for the need of an English host also the entire day for the whole event. I immediately told whoever made the schedule that it was more reasonable to spread out the responsibilities amongst all the translators hired. He agreed and made changes only for the next days (a reminder that day 1 of main event ended around 2AM). Then not long after Jack told me that the stage host PW hired needed to leave after 5PM on weekdays for her radio job so I would need sub in as the Chinese host after she leaves. Due to heavy delay of matches she only did one post match interview that first day since the first series ended around 3PM. This was completely out of my comfort zone. I was extremely nervous about the job and felt very uncomfortable being thrown into that position on the spot. Luckily for me I had my buddy Jack going through this with me. Neither of us had any real hosting experience so I hope we didnt do a horrible job on stage. We tried helping each other with writing questions and watched out for each other.      Workday hours for many people this event was from 7AM to 3AM and on the first day of the main event after everything ended there werent enough shuttles to take all of us back to the hotel. The Russian production and some of us translators had to wait outside the venue at 2:40AM for shuttles to return from the previous trip to pick us up.     Even when Jack and I were asked to sub in for host and help with other duties that werent meant for translators to do we did those because it was an opportunity for us and we care about the event running smoothly. However that didnt mean we should be doing extra work for the salary we were going to be paid. PW never talked to us about a raise. I felt really abused during the third day of the event it was almost time to clear out the venue a staff came by the make up room to let me know that I was supposed to make the announcement of kicking people out of the venue. I was completely puzzled and had no idea why they would want me to make that announcement on stage right after the interview. A Valve staff next to me immediately said no and asked whose idea was it for me to do such a thing. The staff replied Anderson said Xixi (my Chinese name) can do it. I felt really abused that day but honestly I wouldve done what they asked me to if the Valve staff didnt stop them so Im really grateful to her for standing up for me.     Moving onto the stage. The venue was huge and the stage looked amazing but that didnt mean there were no issues. I remember after the first interview with Kuroky the lights dimmed so stage area was pitch dark I was wearing super high heels and I couldnt find my way down the stage in the dark because it was impossible to see where the stairs were. I waited for Kuro to finish packing then he tested for steps to get off stage and helped me walk down. The edge of the stage that lights up were plastic pieces glued together and whenever someone stepped on the parts that were glued together these pieces sunk in a little. I fell later that day and after that every time I get off the stage after an interview two MarsTV staff waited by the stage to help me down. On the fourth day of the event they waxed the stage. I have no idea why anyone would do that but it was extremely slippery and people slipping were a big concern.      By the fourth day of the event only 4 translators had badges that let you enter the venue. Having only a few translators at the venue also meant that our responsibilities got heavier. At this point translators were responsible for stage duties part-time hosting subtitling the videos for Chinese and English production and helping teams out when there are issues and there seem to always be issues.  On top of that the badges only allow access on the ground floor. What does that mean? It means we cant go up to the suites and we cant even go into the audience. I love watching games in the crowd with everyone else. I love the hype and energy. Jack and I used normal event tickets to watch 2 games of the upper bracket final between Secret and Liquid and we had to walk at least 10 minutes all the way around the venue to do that when there were elevators and doors literally a minute away from backstage. One of the translators Josh literally gave up on coming to the venue because he was sick of sneaking around. And on the last day I got stopped on my way to the stage area even though I had a backstage badge. Not to mention previous days I walked around without a badge why didnt these guards do their job then?      Despite all the things that went wrong for Shanghai Major it is a valuable lesson for everyone involved. The purpose of writing about it is to share with you what I saw went wrong from my eyes hoping for future events that everything will improve. Im not sure what Valve Perfect World or other tournament organizers will think of me after this blog is released but I think it is the right thing to tell the world my experience at this event. To everyone who worked really hard at Shanghai Major thank you for caring about the community and having passion for the game we all love. Lastly a big shout out to Thad Sharon Bruno from Valve Jasper ROC Peter Zeal from Perfect World Danny Azi Langzi Mien Yuan Director from MarsTV Rob Bryan from BTS all the English talents all the translators and team nannies Steph Ryan Sean and my buddy Jack. ,personal
I feel sorry for 1k and 2k players trying to get better.,self.DotA2,Almost 6k here. Was watching my little brother play today at 1.5k and it's a fucking head ache just spectating. I'm telling him to tell his team's to do certain things to go with the flow of the game and people even though they speak English refuse to listen. 3 people dead 1 support up and people just go farm and call my little brother wrong for wanting to push with a drowmirana and clinks after I told him to do it. Even when everyone speaks English trash at that mmr see that if it isn't 30+minutes they can't push for some reason. 4 games in a row watching him play he lost because his English speaking team didn't want to listen to basic Dota mechanics.  I'm sorry to all you 1k and 2k players who are trying to get better but get stuck with people like this. The next game i pick clinks and solo and win the game by myself to prove to him it can be done alone. But holy shit it's a headache in that bracket. ,personal

I miss my dota buddy. (and why we shouldn't take our friends for granted),self.DotA2,"""Come play a pub with me I'm bored!"" ""No I hate pubs"" ""Fine.""  So we played hard bots instead. He would pick the carry and I would pick a mid hero. I'd either get 30 kills in a row with windranger steal all his kills or go batshit insane because bane bot wouldn't stop ulting me. We tore those bots a new ass. This continued for weeks; we would practise on bots and beg each other to come on to play. Bots were an escape from the harsh reality of pubs.  But then my friends list was quiet. I hadn't played a bot game in over a month now. I checked his steam profile which simply said:  Last online: 28 days ago.  Was he hacked? No he would of contacted me by email if he was. Did he quit dota? No he literally just bought a legion arcana set.  I sent him a few offline messages asking where the hell he was. And one day I got a reply. The first message to him was:  ""OMG WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN??""  And then the kick in the proverbial balls came. He informed me he was diagnosed with cancer. Right in the feels. One day at university the next day in hospital. I'd gone a month without knowing my best dota buddy had gone close to a hair away from dying and that his cancer was discovered before it had spread. Currently he is undergoing chemotherapy and I haven't talked to him for about 20 days now (which is when we last spoke.  You've probably got a lot of friends on your list that play dota right? Do you play over 50% of your dota games with many of them? Have you actually played ANY games since you met? Your friends are people and you must cherish them. This applies to games too: behind every hero is a real person: with real troubles and a real personality.   Cherish your friends because you never know the game you just played with them might be your last together; and theirs too.  I miss my dota buddy.",personal
To the professional players who read Reddit,self.DotA2,An open letter to the professional DotA 2 players.  Earlier in my life I had aspirations of becoming a professional baseball player.  I wasn't highly regarded but I had good enough stuff for some coaches and managers to take me seriously.  As with e-sports baseball has it fair share of crony capitalists lurking for young talent to be taken advantage of.   Talking with other players and former teammates within baseball solidified a few rules which I live by not just in the sports world but in life: 1) ALWAYS get it in writing. 2) ALWAYS get it in writing. 3) Never work for promises.  The world of Tier-1 DotA 2 professional players has more bargaining power than they think they have. Team switching is a strong sign that owners can and will compete for top talent.  When discussing contract terms the most powerful negotiating tactic for a player to say is I liked what we discussed but I'd like to see it in writing before I play for you. This protects you the player and the company to make sure the expectations are well defined and fulfilled with the threat of a lawsuit if one party doesn't uphold their end.  Organizations don't want bad press and players want the security of being paid on time. Having a well defined contract increases the likelihood of this behavior.  I also think it is about time players hire an agent for themselves.  I will take baseball to be an example here.  When sitting down to negotiate compensation a baseball player has a few options. Does he want a no trade clause? Does the player want a long term contract or a short term one? Does the player want a low salary but have incentives (read bonuses) to play better?  All of these things the baseball agent knows well and can counsel the player in getting the most of what he wants.  While agents do take a percentage of your income (winnings sponsorships or otherwise) they give you the peace of mind that you're not being screwed over.  I never made it high enough in baseball to necessitate an agent unfortunately and my opinions are from stories from teammates who have and haven't had an agent when negotiating contracts.  One theme was consistent from these stories however; those players who negotiated with an agent obtained better contracts.  The last thing I must stress is that no matter how much help you get with the contract signing *YOU* are the one responsible for making sure all proposals are in the contract. Not your lawyer not your agent **YOU**.    The professional DotA 2 scene has survived a long time on trust between owners and players. Far longer than I would have imagined. The drama we are witnessing is much the same drama which made baseball players unionize. Owners were taking advantage of them.  Please players protect yourselves and your livelihoods.  You have worked very hard to get where you are in life don't let others be in control.  Sincerely --A DotA 2 Fan,personal

I was robbed and shot.,self.DotA2,About 3 months ago as I was walking home from going to the gym  was held at gun point shot about two times (one thru the belly and one at my upper right shoulder part) I was so close to dying and I became paralyzed from the waist down since of the bullets hit my spine.  Fast forward to today I'm still bed ridden and my right arm hasnt been functioning that well since thats where the second bullet entered I need to constantly move it to get it to atleast how it used to be so I recently bought a new gaming laptop and play Dota2 to atleast help me getting used to using my right arm again (dont worry guys ill only play with bots so i wont ruin your games)  Now the problem is that my steam guard authenticator was in my old phone. and since it got stolen I have no access to it. I already contacted steam but it seems like it would still take a long time can some one give me any tips or advise on what to do to speed up the process? thanks It really has been a tough couple of months and I believe a little bit of Dota2 would help me cheer up.  -Edit: Sorry if there are a lot of grammatical errors as english is not my primary language.

Dota2 from perspective of former master tier lol player,self.DotA2,Hello guys I have seen many posts like that I want to share me experience to about league of legends and dota. First of all sorry for bad englando as it is not my native language.  So as title says I was former master tier player (it's probably like 6k elo in dota2 I guess). I always loved league of legends I have been player of this game for like 5 past years. I started my 'carrier' around beta and sticked to it for next 5 years.   Competetive matches were so fun to watch there were a lot of tournaments in season 2 and season 3 probably best one was IPL5 but something went wrong and riot decided that agressive game is somehow bad for the game or for viewers and they cut it down.   Competetive games now are boring as fuck like seriously 5 kills in 20 minutes is typical teams are swapping lanes afk farming and taking dragons. In League of Legends there is one word that can describe this and it's called *rotations* (memed to death).   For like past year all I did was watching games and play like 2-3 games per week because I was getting nervous really fast after one lose dropped from masters to like diamond 5 and completely lost motivation to play or climb.  After riot introduced that solo queue will not be comming back I decided to switch to dota 2.  First this game stunned me there was so many things that I had to learn 100+ champions 500+ new skills so many active items and new items (I still don't know how to build properly and follow builds or my friend advices) but it was **worth**  I'm really amazed by this game I watched last major and competetive games looked so good although i didnt understand many things. I have been learning from watching and playing by myself (u guys even have replays wow) this game is everything riot would like theirs game to be. It's much harder  to learn than LoL but after all it's worth all you need to do is spend some time and don't get frustrated too fast I just started my ranked carrier and hit 25k (I think it's not that bad for new player is it?) and I hope that I'll be getting better and better.  I noticed things that riot 'stole' from you after I started playing dota so many similiraties in skills items or even champions.  What I wanted to write is that Dota2 is really good game much much better than other moba's there are a lot of unique champions skills that aren't in other games and I hope more and more players from league of legends will switch to dota as I did and let riot kill their game on their own.  edit: I know you guys are joking but I only spent 200 hours in Dota2 and hit 25k mmr compared to almost 4000 hours in league of legends so i don't think it's comparable ,personal

Recently decided to really put some time into playing Dota. After a couple of brutal games... no regrets.,self.DotA2,"This game is fantastic.   Early tl;dr I've come from League played it for years and only slightly dabbled in Dota here and there.  So I started playing Dota and the first thing I love every hero is free. Not only that but ""hey this character has a headpiece I really really love I wish I could have that. But eh I don't feel like buying a ski- holy shit it's only 7 cents? Alright yea. Let's go!""  The second thing I noticed when I started playing more heroes was that wow these skills and items are... well I guess I just have to say ballsy? Ballsy in that League would NEVER consider things like *stealing an enemy ultimate* or *becoming immune to magic and CC*.   And finally no runes and masteries? You're telling me that I can just go into a game choose my hero and my entire game will be based on how I adapt to who I'm playing against and not pre-setup pages of things I grinded out? Oh hell yes.   It really appeals to me how amazingly diverse and different every hero is and how at least in my experience so far every hero I play can be used to dominate instead of instantly being at a huge disadvantage. (Also can we talk about the hero pool used in tournaments compared to champs used in League? Soooo much more diversity everyone gets used!)   Your price pools are insane your heroes are amazing and delightful your abilities are unique and refreshing your items are HUGE crazy and you're all a bunch of assholes in game but for some reason it makes me feel all warm inside.   Big tl;dr go Dota.",personal
A message to OG from a fan,self.DotA2,Don't do it. Don't shuffle. Your fans are loyal your brand is strong your dota is masterful. So you lost 2 BO3s against arguably the two teams you were least prepared for. A slightly different playoff assignment would see you coasting to top 3.   Cr1t Miracle- Moon I know you guys are being courted and getting offers from every direction. Fuck that. Stay with the fam fam. Show everyone it's through the highs and the lows.

I stopped playing ranked. I don't remember the last time I had this much fun playing dotes.,self.DotA2,"I calibrated at 3.6k long ago and grinded my way up to 5555 MMR. The games were tedious. You could have a 1-hour long hard game and earned those precious +25 MMR points and the next game had a Peruvian kid at mid getting killed once tilting and feeding on purpose losing the MMR you worked hard to get in just a few minutes.  It was ok though as long as you won more games than lost. But if you wanted to win you had to reduce your hero pool to just the few heroes you really knew how to play and perfect your game. Want to play a chill game with a hero you never play? Nah! I need MMR.  Then you had bad days where you lost 8 games in a row and lost 200 MMR leaving you sad like a pepe. But it was all worth it right? You FINALLY reached 5k. Every dedicated Dota player's milestone. You climb your way up to 5.5k even. You finally get to play games with other high performance players and have epic games right? WRONG!   Valve's match making system doesn't work like that. Once you hit 5.5k 9 out of 10 games will be you + at least three people who are 1200 MMR lower than you. If you want to reach 6k you have to be SO GOOD and focused you can carry four 4ks all by yourself or else you get reported and called an account buyer. The trench never ends.  No thanks! I finally choose to have fun instead. I quit all of that and just play to have fun now. Last night I played Sniper went Desolator Aghs and rapier and was 1-shot killing both enemy supports with one spell. The other day was Aghs/Refresher Luna time. Orbital cannon! Dagon Techies is also a blast and I finally get to practice Terrorblade and Shadowfiend heroes I never bothered playing because I knew I was bad at them but was obsessed with playing ranked so there was no way I would try them.  I still get the ""how are you 5k? you suck"" comments whenever I try one of these meme builds and lose but it was k.",personal
Why this TI is important (to me),self.DotA2,"Sorry but this story is going to be a bit ""woe is me"" and such.  So growing up I didn't have any friends. I was bullied and sunk into gaming because I needed an escape. It wasn't till I came across DotA that I actually felt happy. I would play DotA every second I could for 4 years (2014 - now). Sadly though around this time my dad had begun to have a lot more work and travel on his plate. As I sunk more and more into my games he had more and more work to do. We drifted apart and it got to the point that I just disliked talking to him because we were so different. He would argue with me about everything especially how much time I spend on DotA.  Just recently I actually began talking to my parents about the friends I had made online from DotA. People I treasure so much. And as they found out more about them they began to question me more and soon realised that they know nothing about me except for the surface level.  So my dad asked if I wanted to spend a week with him somewhere so him and I could reconnect and be father and son again. Seeing as I always hear about his day at work and when ever I would talk about my games it would just spark an argument about health and such I thought that him and I could go to TI so he could understand not only what game I play but also the community around it. The people that although can be toxic in the end are some of the loveliest people you can meet.   This is my first TI ever and although I am sad that I won't see the final live. I'm happy that I will finally get to show my dad what my life is like. Show him that games aren't just some mindless button spamming and yelling. I will finally get to connect with someone who should have been there for me through some shitty times and I will get to see a bit into him that isn't just arguing with me and being a doctor.   TL;DR - Me and my dad will be reconnecting after years of sinking into our own separate lifestyles. This will be my first TI and a chance to show my dad what my life is like",personal

Life of a Korean Dota 2 Tier 2 player.,self.DotA2,"   Hi. I'm ghettokid79 a.k.a Bangfish probably known as that guy who plays with sing (or used to ) or that guy who writes blogs about proplayers once a year or so. I was gonna write something about the MVP players before TI to bring up the hype and shed some light on my beloved players but this letter which was posted on a korean dota forum just seemed much more urgent. It ticked something inside me. A mixture of regret anger and all sort of animesque emotions started bursting out of me. Reminding me of my old days when I used to dream of being a top tier dota 2 player which I gave up rather quickly. Maybe I wasn't desperate enough maybe I wasn't talented enough maybe I wasn't diligent enough maybe I didn't have the guts to do it. Or maybe life as a tier 2 player just fucking sucks and its not worth trying at all. Personally this memory of givng up your dream haunts me rather frequently and its god damn fuckign annoying. On top of that it feels amazing when it's not the game itself that made u give up on your dreams but those exterior life factors that kicked you in the ass strangled you to give up.      This letter reminded me of that moment when I first thought 'man. fuck. gaming as a career this shit ain't worth it' after meeting the owner of FXO(famous for it's rather huge and successful sc2 squad). Dude was suspicious as fuck and had this vibe that i didn't want to be related in anyway. His whole business and korea e-sports in general is just a huge shitshow based on abusing young naive talents to make some money and not share them. Since I didn't wanted to be part of this shady organization and March did this resulted in me and my team(March Sagun Ranto) to part ways. After that I kinda gave up on becoming relevant and headed on to college. And it haunts me until today. (OH GOD WISH I TRIED. FUCK. BUT THE SYSTEM WAS SO ASS.)  Well this is another story so let's move on. You will probably catch more about this in my stream which is probably gonna happen later in this year!! Also my steam is offline for like 200 days. plz dont delete me my fellow steam friends. I'm coming soon.     In this thread I will translate something written by shuma a 7k support player who used to play in the MVP teamhouse which accuses the reality of a tier 2 player in Korea. Some might say ""they didn't win anything why do they deserve anything"" don't know about you guys but to be honest I'd rather not dip my feet into this exploitation structure in the first place even if I have the talent and will to success. I wish to share this piece of information with you guys to help people protrait how the life of a tier 2 player actually is. Also wish you can understand about the ecosystem here and we can start making the scene more player/talent friendly than it is now. Also hope people would be more aware of how dangerous it is to fantasize about this whole scene.     Fyi Shuma() streams and he is a pretty talented support player who plays mostly on china server. One of my personal favorite streams nowadays. Not sure if he speaks english tho. He probably reads and types decent english since hes korean. go check him out. https://www.twitch.tv/skk974  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 	[Current Status of Korean Dota. ]         -Writer Shuma   Korean Dota consist of only 1 team and I guess y'all know which team it is. Imma gonna write only about 100% pure facts about this team.  I was a abid fan of MVP aegis and MVP hot6 and also part of it as a player.  My personal belief about a 'team' is that 'team' should grow and increase in potential via scrimming in regualr schdules. There are other stuff(personal talent amount of practice and positive feedback environment) that are important but scrimming hard should have the utmost importance. Frankly speaking you are giving up your whole youth to be a pro this should be basic stuff. Disappointingly this was not true.  My first impression of the MVP teamhouse was 'ah just a lan cafe huh' It was nothing of a try-hardy environment even to the eyes of a newcomer like me.  This was around september 2013 when both teams(aegis and hotsix) were active. Since I didn't know every personal circumstances of the palyers and maybe it had a more free environment I just let it through.  Time flows and nothing imporves. Not a single thing. (I was a sub-member outsider solo-rank warrior. Hence I could observe this in a rather rational point of view.)  Frequent fights among players. Pathetic amount of practice. Is this for real? are they even trying to go pro? MVP phoenix players and a few diligent players talked about this issue to the coach but till 2016 nothing really changed.  Could really tell that everyone was annoyed and no one could maintain a positive attitude. After scrims players always argued with each other. Feedbacks? LOL nice joke. It was a fucking disaster. I heard MVP had interviews before they recruit trainees. Did these guys really pass the interviews? holy fuck.  Everyday there are these trival torubles everywhere and no one trys to fix that. Players and staffs both. This escalated to our tournaments and MVP A was almost on the verge of disbanding. So the staffs put up a deal at 2016 that every player should at least reach 6k mmr to stay in the team house. I thought this was a chance for me even though I was kicked from the main roster twice i had 6.5k mmr  I had no doubt that i was gonna be on the main roster. I didn't even thought about how much of a bullshit deal this was back then.  2017 everyone under 6k mmr went home and the rest of us becomes MVP hot6 No one on our team could play carry so the youngest of us(who was me) played carry.  Our scrims were pretty good. We would win against execretion and signiture trust. We weren't exactly the worst team in the universe. We even won against Youngminds 2:0 at the Mr.cat tourney It seemed pretty good we were becoming a solid team.  And suddenly someone who left the mvp teamhouse comes back the staff insists that we should swap out someone to make this team better and I was forced to become a sub in this team.  During a scrim game I kinda gave a few bad orders which resulted in a loss and right after that game I was forced to sub for this team. Like seriously? I had the 2nd highest mmr I have the longest practice hours. And I'm just kicked? oh well  After that I couldn't help myself on thinking negatively about how this whole mvp thing thinks about their players and player's future. You let someone who left come join a team and kick someone whos been working hard. Great stuff. Is there even a point to try hard in this place? The new Hot6 eventually blew up in a bad way and around april 2017 it was worse than ever. And to your surprise not a single coach gave a fuck. fights gets worse and no one takes control of this situation.  At march the few leftovers who are staying here make the last version on hot6. Honestly scrims werent that bad. We had potential and shit. Thought we had a chance if we just had some time. But shit happens.  Our most quiet player got mad and was raging. And the Coach just comes up and tell the player to go home. Like seriously? go home? where in the world does a coach just tells a player to go home. did he even think before he said that? i doubt that.  he literally didnt give a single fuck during the few years and randomly comes up and says fuck off. what a joke.  After that hot6 disbands and the rest is left alone all playing solo ranked. the coach came up with a brilliant idea that players should climb 350 mmr points every month and at the end of 2017 everyone should get 8.5~9k mmr.  This is the facts about my time during MVP. From now on i will talk about my personal opinions.  MVP A scrimed RRQ and won 2:0 at 2016.6 They actually played pretty good even had a good run at open qualifiers but no one from the mvp staff gave a fuck.  well i guess the coach was busy with MVP phoenix and i thought that the the players individually didnt try hard enough.  But while i was playing in the 2017 MVP hot6 I felt something. 'youngminds' who we won against last year alwasys climbed to top 16 consistantly in the TI OQs 'ulrica' a chinese team we never lost to climbed to top 8 in the TI OQs  before i joined MVP when i was on team 3154 we used to scrim 12 hours a day after 2 weeks we could win almost every tier 2 sea team and stand against WG pretty evenly I strongly believed that if someone could lead us to have proper scrim schdules and practice regulary we could do better I told this at out monthly meeting session and no one actually gave a fuck. If you(MVP STAFFS) aint gonna take authorization and help us get better at least give it to us so we can actually try. If you actually cared we(MVP A MVP 6) could actually be a decent team. But u didnt care.   Besides all the trainees were given a bed to sleep and food and a additional 100 bucks every month for allowance.  Like during weekends no one cooks for us so we have to buy food at weekends. I thought of this 100 bucks as the magistrate for my life standards. But they kinda didnt believe that was our right and started to not pay us that 100 bucks everyonce in a while. so oh well...  btw the coach havent been on dota ever since 2017.5.23 i dont even know the purpose of all this MVP dota thing I dont know anything I kinda wanna talk more but dunno i guess i gotta go.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  well thats it. Shuma's rant about his run to go pro in dota in some raw language.(kinda lost interest in translating it into edible pieces. Can feel that he just went down with rage. gotta respect it and go with it.) I doubt that even mvp phoenix didn't got the respect and care they deserved ever since March left. March was basically everyones big bro and made sure everyone was treated well and paid well. After March left you can see that the whole squads all over the world like dragon balls. Like how does a TI6 top6 team just evaporate in thin air.  I wonder why.   TLDR : life sucks life of a tier 2 dota 2 player sucks more. edit: some typos some formats some stuff",personal

Thursday patch true story,i.redd.it,,personal
An update on my situation - Chessie former player for [A],self.DotA2,Hello guys!  I'll try to keep this as short but informative as possible. As some of you know I transitioned to Dota from Heroes of Newerth during the summertime -14. I had been playing high level matchmaking for a few months already by then so there were some offers from various teams after TI which was when I wanted to go competitive because top-tier teams will reshuffle and have spots available. Anyhow I ended up playing for Alliance. After a few weeks my problems slowly began first with pains in my shoulder-blades but shortly after the pain started spreading to neck and shoulders. I immediately started visiting a well-known naprapath for treatments but with no effect. Having constant pain even when I'm not on the computer is not a fun thing and it had a big impact on my social life. I tried to keep playing with experts telling me that I should get rid of this injury if I just changed my daily patterns and started going for walks stretching doing physical therapy and so on. But nothing worked the pain was always there. My situation was really bad because on one hand I wanted to start winning tournaments and prove myself but then again my pain was getting worse and my gameplay was so poor. I was always the guy playing matchmaking all the time when not scrimming but during my time with Alliance I couldn't play matchmaking at all so I was limited to play scrims and officials. We managed to qualify for WCA in China ESL One New York and Starladder season 10 but I wasn't feeling like playing at all at this point. After consultation with my naprapath & chiropractor as well as my psychologist I still went to China to participate in WCA even though I wanted Alliance to go with a stand-in instead. This did not make things better and my trip just wasn't enjoyable even though we had great results and it was a fun experience outside of the pain I experienced. I decided before we went home that I wouldn't keep playing before this injury had fully healed so Alliance went with Hanni and Apemother instead for the upcoming LAN-events.   &nbsp;   After this I went kind of underground didn't want to log into Steam because everyone was always asking me how I'm progressing when I can play and so on. I started experiencing heavy dizziness and other symptoms which my doctors thought were related to anxiety and stress so they gave me useless medicines which made things worse. And even though I have done every single treatment possible probably visited over 10+ different experts nothing seems to be working. I was asked to stop playing games and focus on other stuff in my life and so I did only play about 1 game every 2-3 days for quite a while. But living a life with constant pains and without my passion which is games is not a fun thing to do.     &nbsp;  So now I'm beginning a new kind of treatment which seems very promising and I am also taking a different direction and approach towards my problems. As long as I take breaks between games live a generally healthy lifestyle with a lot of exercise it is not believed that my injury will get worse while playing. My mental state of mind might be very important to begin healing so writing this post is my first step in the right direction talking about it openly instead of just playing games on my sub-account in secret.    &nbsp;  Anyhow enough with that. As of today I will SLOWLY begin playing more games and stream my rehabilitation on twitch.tv/chessie. The first few days I will only play 2-3 games each day then I will take it from there and see what happens. I barely made the 15 games necessary in the past 21 days to show up on the leaderboards and I've got a MMR of 7100 right now so that's a start. Going on various treatments every week is expensive so this is my way to try to both get an overall higher quality on life to be able to heal and also make myself some money as I cannot perform a regular job like this.     &nbsp;  If there's any questions you got for me I will try to be active with my chat in my stream as I do not expect to hit high viewer numbers from the beginning and thus it should be easy to answer whichever questions you may have.  Thanks for your time! /end rant  &nbsp;  Quick update thanks for everyone tuning in to the stream and thank you for all your kind words! I didn't wanna go too in-depth on every specialist I've visited but I've been to multiple doctors done various scans and tried every treatment I've gotten recommended. Doctors physical therapists therapist naprapath chiropractor acupuncture the whole charade. This is high-end specialists in Sweden who I have full faith in alot of them who are working with Swedish professional athletes in regular sports. I will be back with more streaming tomorrow! ,personal
I'm a bad player,self.DotA2,"Today I was in a bot match practicing my early Lycan jungle and I looked at the map and saw that my sniper was alone in the safelane going against a dual lane without a support. I said to myself ""Why is sniper alone what retard decided to jungle."" It was me. I was in jungle. I'm a bad player",personal
As techies my primary objective is to mine and defend. My secondary objective? To tilt the enemy.,self.DotA2,"It's two minutes in. We've collected the rune from the already disgruntled juggernaut in the top lane. He hopes he will regain his lost bounty with the warmth of a fresh creep wave and a pushed lane. Think again juggernaut. First blood rings across the screen as the juggernaut explodes his mask tossed asunder as my mines have their righteous way with him. I've already collected what gold he's mustered I am growing more and more powerful.  I reach level three as he reaches lane. He's already frustrated my lane mate goes to fountain I'm weak a vulnerable little techies left to be mercilessly ravaged by juggernaut's superior strength and right click abilities. Once again juggernaut your actions betray you. I've planted yet another mine stack my swiftness and discipline paying off. He's been left with 20 health a calculated maneuver as I perform the rigorous math theorems to measure each stack's damage after reductions. Death crawls upon him and gives chase with the sound of the techies attack animation. He is running as the burning projectile flies through the air streaming for his blood in the cold air. As it collides I've collected my prize and I type into the chat a single solitary question mark.   He's angry - He thinks he can still win the lane. Nay poor juggernaut. I have won the lane. I have won the game. He finally reaches his level six and his teammates are furious. If he loses against me again he will certainly be flamed. His arms quake as he readies his ult. Juggernaut you've activated my trap card. As you attack me with your ult I dash with the added speed of my wind lace soon to be turned into a euls with this time's feed into a mine pile. He knows it's the end of his pathetic life and he is destroyed instantly. I already hear the gnashing of his team's teeth. I've thrown him to the wolves of his own pack.   Axe comes to gank. They coordinate an attack on me those poor souls. Axe calls me catching me still with only half of my health. He thinks me a fool but little does he know that I've activated my greatest ability I have just enough mana for do my power as I detonate my mines. Axe is obliterated by my swift talons of justice and juggernaut is once again left with 100 health. I use my euls. As he turns through the air feeling the breeze on his skin as the cinder of his teammates brings a sting to it the techies loom below him a shark in the water. I explode in holy fire as I cleanse this lane from this cabal of unworthy ones.   First objective? Successful as every rat attempt by the pathetic juggernaut is met with swift fiery justice my boots enabling rapid speed across the map to mine my towers. You think you've got our t2? I draw it out. With every attack you bring the tower closer to demise. You think they're there you for a fleeting moment of clarity among the ashes that you'll be spared my obliteration but you're wrong. I take your tower from you I steal it as swiftly as the owl severs the spine of a baby bird.   Second objective? As we take the throne among the ruins of what may have been the enemy team's friendship flaming erupts. Blaming reporting hating. Before I leave I type a single sentence. ""Ez"". As I leave from the immolation of the enemy team's unholy rage I smirk. Objective two accomplished. My techies winrate ascends to 79.6. I've failed. I must train harder. ",personal

Goodbye DreamLeague /Producer,self.DotA2,Hello all   I think most of you don't know me which is in place. Despite this I just wanted to do a post here since today was my last day of producing DreamLeague. I've been working with DreamLeague since season 3 and it's been quite a journey.   Browsing reddit after each broadcast and listening in to your continuous feedback has been a daily routine and since I'm not a regular writer here I just want to take the chance of saying thanks. You've all had great input throughout the years and many times been a great inspiration to all the buttons that we've been doing in the broadcasts (which is like way over fifty or so).  Also I would like to thank all the great people involved working with DreamLeague since this has been a huge team effort. Especially all the talent that are doing an amazing work in front of the camera. Sheever Slacks Draskyl ODPixel Shane and all the guests and other talent that been guests in the studio during my time with the project.   It's also easy to forget all the other extremely talented people working with this project. Not only in-house at DreamHack but also freelancers like Marcin Edje Skruff Weppas and the guys over at datdota. You're all a big part of the (in my eyes at least) great success of DreamLeague during the seasons. Thank you too.  I'm now moving on with other projects and leaving DreamLeague feels a bit weird. But just like Ricky told Bubbles in TPB after he resisted to let go of that Puma (which they fed with weed if I remember right); If you love something set it free. Thats kind of what Im doing now after nurturing DreamLeague with memes (better than drugs yall).  I hope you enjoy this season to the fullest and that you're ready for some Stranger Memes (which goes with our new video design if you've seen it).   Thanks for watching and keep on doing so!  /Martin Edsman,personal
Games on China servers are what dota 2 should be like.,self.DotA2,So im really Only here to show appreciation to any of you Chinese redditors. I've recently moved to China and playing on Chinese servers is a blessing. Random draft is amazing! Good on you guys for keeping it alive!    I'm 4.5k and when I first started playing in China I lost a lot I found myself not being on the same level as people here. They had incredible team play. They always tp counter gank Always work together to secure objectives and very few players play selfish.  In my last three months of Dota I can count with my fingers how many griefers I encountered. And every time I report someone action is always taken.    I barely speak Chinese I have basic understanding though and can figure out what the team is doing and it really hasn't slowed my team down the slightest. Regardless of language barriers dota is still dota and people in the same mmr usually have similar instincts.   The greatest thing about games here Is nobody flames nobody blames you for making a mistake and rarely do teams harm each other by stealing farm or fighting over courier.  So you don't feel under pressure and best of all you get this feeling a very special feel that you have 4 allies. It's like back in the US id always feel like I'm about to join a game with 9 enimes 4 of which who have a shared goal with me so we work together only because we want that +25. However over here in China I feel like these guys are actually my allies people you can trust and even fall in love with for that 40 minute game.   I know this is a blog post but truly thank you very much China for allowing me to experience Dota in an incredible way. I hope we can learn from them. Let's start with the man in the mirror.,personal

I am retiring from Esports after six years,self.DotA2,"Most of the folks here are unfamiliar with me but a decent amount should be familiar with the site GosuGamers.net which is an Esports portal covering games with news match tickers betting and database. I am currently operations manager there and the database (specifically for DotA/Dota 2) has been my passion for six years. Earlier this year I decided to retire from Esports due to various of reasons (going back to university bad personal habits depression change of scenery and so on) and this upcoming week will be my last charted time at GosuGamers and within Esports. I hope you have enjoyed the work I have done and the things I have been building at GosuGamers and the work they will continue to do after my departure.      I started out volunteering because I loved Dota and I loved the feeling of making others happy by providing coverage of the competitive scene. Later that passion turned into a full time paid job within Esports. So to everyone out there who wants to work within Esports; go for it. You will probably have to spend a bit of time first at low pay (or no pay at all) to prove yourself make people reliant on you and such. After that you might get offered salary or at least have build merits to prove you're valuable in Esports.    Not going to lie it's a lot of hard work. My time volunteering was like a part-time job counting the time I spent and the responsibilities I had. Worth noting is that mostly I took on responsibilities myself when something we did was unsmooth or wrong I would feel terrible and would have a hard time sleeping afterwards. I'd feel like I had failed myself and the community even if it was just some ""whatever""-scenario. As it became a full time job there were almost not a single month where I didn't spend over 200 hours working. This was because I wanted to prove my worth and also because I had a hard time letting things go unattended. But at the end of the day it was my choice and my passion.      Esports is growing so much it'll be amazing to see what the next year is like with the majors and all the change they bring. And for the first time I will now be following it as purely as fan.    ---    Over these six years I have;  * been responsible for Dota/Dota 2/general match ticker and database at GosuGamers since 2009 my ambition was always to provide users with an updated and accurate database. Some minor detail being wrong could bug me for days so in the end I had to fix it. Hardest part was to track Chinese tier 2-3 players and their frequently changed nicknames.  * been head admin for Dota 2 at Dreamhack Winter 2011 Dreamhack Summer 2012 and Dreamhack Winter 2012  * covered numerous of matches ""gosubets"" and teams at GosuGamers. Added numerous of replays and VODs.  * published over 500 article pieces as well as close to 100 event coverage hubs (along with updating them)  * attended TI2 TI3 and TI4 for live coverage. Did some interviews at TI3 due lack of an interviewer. In general I'm not an on-camera or interviewer personality at all but I remember [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Tj0baTFXV4) with Alliance.s4 going quite well I had to wing every single question as I was expecting an interview with Loda and Akke and the questions I had prepared were very specific.    * been involved in the running of various online events such as GosuLeague (five seasons in 2012) Corsair Gaming Summer Tour (2013) various GosuCups (2012-2014) Awesome Cup (Awesomenauts) Enter the Storm (Heroes of the Storm)  * for those who remember GarenaTV and WaaaghTV (it's a bit like DotaTV today and is what was used in Dota1 there were no livestreams people only watched it this way or downloaded the replay afterwards) I streamed heaps of matches there on both platforms for events such as GosuCup MYM Prime Defending CM Storm Razer Global Challenge Dota League Balkan League and plenty I don't even remember the name of anymore.    ---    **SHOUT-OUTS TO**   my girlfriend GosuGamers Banos Club Skim MarelePisoi Angel Nydra ReiNNNN everlast dopeshow Trisnt drouks klyte01 ISB Raistlin MrBlue Zeyall KongoTime NiNCOMPOOP BlueKnight Sheever x3m4eg Fantasy malnor Hellspawn Nukes Greykarn Dreamhack Tobiwan Mooseman Wilco Whatiship Ren Sun_Tzu Wagamama v1lat glen.84 Eresea Geffo jhoves DreXxin Heflamoke couchor Danny89 VioleN Dorazion exlbrs Ikarus synergis Shark0killer marCoon ANdre Black^  Dendi NS Baja Mantis kurtcos      ...and everyone who loves Dota!

Played with a new player today. Felt damn guilty,self.DotA2,"I started working a month ago so I don't really have time for some rank games. If I have some time I would play Turbo matches instead. It's very fun btw but that's another topic.    I queued SEA server teammate picked normal heroes. Our first pick magnus wanted the mid lane so fine no big deal. It's just Turbo game anyway. I picked storm and laned with a Huskar in top lane.    Me and Huskar were against void and sniper. Huskar max third skill. Seemed pretty normal build. However whenever sniper or void hit him first thing he did was running away. He would have 10% hp pretty much guaranteed he's dead and still he chose to run away. I was pretty sure he would have killed them both if he stood there and right click. He proceeded to die 4 times in 10 minutes.    I then triggered my inner keyboard warrior I flamed him. ""wtf you max third skill why did you run?!?!"" ""damn noob"" and so on. He never said anything. He was quiet the whole game. Once in a while he would use the in-game phrase like Push now. Get Back!   15 minutes in. Since it's a turbo game the game is pretty much decided at this point and my team was winning anyway. Out of curiousity I clicked his dota profile.    - Profile Level 8.  - GPM 233 - XPM 254.    First thing came to my mind shit he's a new player? Then I opened his steam profile.    - Dota 2 is the only game with 71 hours played.  - He played 5.2 hours the past 2 weeks.  - He has 3 friends in the friends list.    I don't know whether he's a smurf or legit new player. From the game we played together he's clearly someone that didn't know what he's doing. He bought Desolator as huskar. He was going to buy Satanic and had already bought Morbid Mask and Reaver. The thing is he has 2 mangoes in his inventory so both his Morbid Mask and Reaver are in the backpack. He didn't know what is backpack.  I tried to teach him to swap the items and mangoes by dragging the items. He stood there for few seconds probably trying to do so. But he didn't manage to put the Morbid Mask and Reaver back to the inventory. The game ended right there.   Sorry for the long message. I felt so damn bad for him also guilty for what I have done to him in the beginning. I commended him told him I'm sorry in steam message. I also sent him a drow set with the message ""This hero is easier to start off with"". I went back to his steam profile and saw he's offline already.    Seriously fuck me man. It's only monday and I'm treating people like shit already. Sorry huskar and sorry to all the new players that just joined this game. Heck it doesnt matter whether they are new players or not I should probably use my brain more often and treat people nicely. Sorry for the long message. ",personal
My thoughts on DotA addiction and personal life,self.DotA2,There is a vice to every fascination and an Achille's heel to every joy.   Take note of this [demographics survey](http://imgur.com/a/gpfME) by /u/electricf0x. I'm a 23 year old male currently in college which is very similar to most of you and these are my thoughts:  DotA 2 is a wonderfully complex game that appeals to my competitive nature love of fantasy and action and respect of a well designed game.  Quite simply I love this game and perhaps a bit too much.  This is an odd thing to say but for some reason boredom can be a wonderful thing.  I don't like going out to social events to meet new people; yet when I am bored I tend to do that.  I don't like studying for my college classes; yet when I am bored and motivated I do that.  DotA has the ability to remove any boredom or want for adventure or something different.  The game is too enjoyable and that scares me.    When I play this game I don't care about my girlfriend I don't care about meeting my parents I don't care about going outside to go hiking or floating or drinking with friends; I simply want to play this game.  That sounds a lot like a drinking or drug addiction which does not help you in the adventure of life.  Whether its a game or drugs or drinking or travelling its good to keep in mind if your current fascination is a benefit or detriment to how you are living your life.  Some of us have been there: you wake up and play this game for 8 to 13 hours until you go to bed while ignoring all texts calls and other opportunities while your grades social relations and fitness suffers.  I want to be a person who is well versed in all aspects of life rather than just one hobby.  If DotA is affecting your academic or personal life do take a break and focus on other areas of your life.  The focus of life shouldn't be around one game.  So just keep in mind that there's more to how you are living than just this game and if you feel addicted to it to the point where you can't give attention to anything else that is good for you it is a good idea to temporarily uninstall the game and find joys in other parts of life. ,personal

Ever been harassed in a game of Dota? These guys have reached new levels of assholery,self.DotA2,"[Was just told about this group of people by a guy who played with one of them.](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/KILLSELFPLS)   In his words: ""A guy on my team just now added me to tell me to go kill myself. Which is actually pretty typical of the average Dota player but this fucker goes a step further. He has a Steam group where he digs up and posts the names and the Facebook pages of people who somehow wronged him in Defense Against the Ancients 2. Does Valve just kind of go along with this level of harassment and general toxic behavior?""  Both me and him have reported the group and the people who are posting this stuff but this just goes above and beyond other stuff I've seen from some people. Is there anything else that can be done about these guys other than just sit around and hope Valve decides to actually do something about this?  **edit:** just got home saw this really blew up. Nice to see that all those groups those guys had up that did similar stuff got taken down. Good job valve but it really shouldn't take a reddit post to bring your attention to things like this.

Hey r/dota2 a man needs your help for his undergraduate dissertation.,self.DotA2,Let me introduce myself first. I'm a 21 y/o college student from Uruguay doing a major in Communication and specialized in advertising and branding. I study at Universidad de la Repblica and I've just entered the final year of my college career which means I have to propose for an undergraduate dissertation on my area of interest to conduct research through the year.   As a Dota and esports fan overall one topic that I'd like to research is *advertisement and sponsorships in the world of esports and how that works for all the different actors involved*. Now that comes with a couple of difficulties for me. First I need to gather sources of information and second I need to convince the head of the research department that the topic is worth investigating. The latter is completely up to me but the former is the reason I came here for. Here in Uruguay there is no pro scene so I have no representatives from organizations I can go to in order to get some info.  Now we all know r/dota2 is a place that players organizations tournament organizers and other actors frequently visit so what I want to ask from you is to help me get **visibility** so that they can see my case and if they are willing to help communicate with me. In order to make a good case on why this matters as a subject of research I'm gonna need to prove that I can gather good sources of information and as many as possible. So please help a man raise awareness of esports and maybe even help to the development of the industry if the research comes through.   *TL;DR* I'm trying to conduct research on advertisement and sponsorships in esports but I need to contact players orgs representatives please help make this visible.    **EDIT** Wow this got big faster than I expected. Thanks guys! I will get in contact with the people you've suggested altough I'll wait till major is over so people are not so busy and I don't bother them. Really appreciate your help! You guys are great.,personal

League player plays Dota 2,self.DotA2,"Hello Redditors of Dota2. I'm a top 5% player in LoL and have recently decided to give Dota2 a try with my brother. I would like to think that I am unbiased and came in with a very open mind.  After downloading the game. My brother and I quickly completed the first part of the tutorial which was essentially telling you how to move and take towers which is very simple considering our previous moba experience. We then decided to move to some bot games to learn the game. The queue was 15 minutes which is very long compared to LoL bot games which has very short queue times. A quick google showed the essentially no one in Dota plays bot games so we switched to normal games.  Very first game we got the shit out flamed out of us for taking heroes into wrong lane and doing things I apparently shouldn't be doing or not doing things I should be doing. Thankfully after thousands of hours of toxicity from LoL we were able the laugh if off. After playing for over 15 hours now I would like to share my thoughts and provide some meaningful discussion about Dota compared to LoL.  The graphics of dota is much more dark and less cheesy characters. I prefer Dota graphics over League however I've played Runescape over 10 years graphics to me is so insignificant compared to game play.  Dota 2 has many more mechanics compared to league. The tutorial barely touches the sea of information you get once you load into a real game. I was very overwhelmed with the new concepts - including secret shops couriers and trees. I don't hate new mechanics which some of my friends have voiced their opinions to me about. ""Why does this stupid game have turn rates"" To me this screams of ignorance different games different mechanics you have to learn it. I didn't even try to deny in my very first game and as I played more and got used to things I could start focusing on the smaller intricacies.  I love the fact you don't have to grind over 30 hours to own one hero and everything impacting the actual gameplay is unlocked from the beginning. (Aside from the fact you can only play 20 heroes in your first 25 games). This to me is one of lols worst things. Therefore having the opposite makes this one of the best things for dota for me.  Matchmaking is god awful every time I finish a game and I view someones profile they have more wins than me and my brother multiplied by 25. I don't understand how this happens when I'm level 1 I should be playing with level 1's. It's different if you're smurfing and you stomp me but when I clearly see you are way higher level than me and dota clearly knows level 1 + level 1 <<<<<<<< level 50 + level 50. It was off putting. Can't imagine a completely new MOBA player starting his first dota game.  No one is helpful. The amount of times me and my brother ask beginner questions only to be replied with the words ""gg noob team"". It's staggering. We learn fast but the toxicity can really put new players off. Distinctly remember first game TOXIC GUY : ""Buy smokes"" ME : ""What are smokes?"" TOXIC GUY : ""Are you fking srs?"" ME : ""Yes"" TOXIC GUY TO ALLCHAT ""OMFG idiot Sniper pls report"" Thank god for this other toxic game I played for many hours and have thickened my skin.  To me multiplayer games don't have a difficulty factor. This is why in multiplayer games you don't pick a mode at the start of each game ""Novice Normal Hard Extreme"". The difficulty of the game depends of the opponents. You face the best players the game is difficult beyond belief. You face the worst players the game is easier than tic tac toe.  A proportion of players think that complexity adds to difficulty. Which I believe to be false. Think of a game like chess the rules are simple yet the skill cap is infinite. Now some people may have heard of a variation of chess ""Crazyhouse"" where a player can introduce a captured piece back to the chessboard as his own. A more complex ""chess"" but a better ""chess"". Debatable.  In my quest to learn Dota I watched a video where a master tier lol player (top 0.2%) plays Dota. Apparently he wasn't very good. The comment section had some quite pitiful remarks. ""Master in lol = 1k mmr in dota"" ""dota player plays lol carries lol player plays dota feeds"". Drawing again on my chess analogy. Crazyhouse is harder to play than normal chess it has more mechanics just like dota has more mechanics than league. Of course when you remove mechanics and have less to worry about you can transition better than adding mechanics in which you have to learn.  I like Dota. I like lol. I don't understand why the two communities are at each other throats all the time. If you play a game you don't have to hate the games competitors especially as a gamer where you can play both without any repercussions. You're not the gaming company you're not in direct competition with each other they don't take your profits.  My thoughts are all over the place I just wanted to get them down and start a discussion. Sorry for writing a very disjointed post. ",personal

I made a website that automatically generates highlights using data from twitch chat. What do you guys think?,self.DotA2,http://skip2.tv  **Here's how it works:** Click on a broadcast to load up the VoD. Click on the red and blue bars to scrub the video.  Each bar represents 15 seconds of chat data and a click will take you to the point in the VoD when those messages were sent minus 30 seconds. Usually this puts you right about where the highlight begins but not always. For cases like these there's a 10s rewind button.  The idea here is being able to watch long VoDs in a short amount of time.  ------------------------------------------------------------  There are still a lot of aspects about the website that need improving and I'll be making changes to it every couple of days. But I think it's time that I opened it up to the community and made this a collaborative process. Any feedback you might have is welcome and appreciated.  In any case I hope skip2 proves to be super useful for everyone trying it out. I'll be here answering questions in the comments below. ,personal
I play DotA2 since 6 months and god why did I wait so long ?,self.DotA2,"So. I'm currently 31 years old and I've played A LOT of videogames since I'm 5. FPS MMO Strategy RPG Indies... Everything was good for me.  The only type of game I didn't tried was the Moba. I wasn't interested in it how can we be ? Always the same map always the same strategies the same heroes etc... I know what you think "" god what a fool "". And you will be right !  My brother-in-law spoke to me about DotA for 5 years since the release always trying to enroll me.  In the end I said yes just to confirm to myself than it was lame.  I WAS WRONG   Since 6 months I've played more than 200 hours. I like this game A LOT. Even if it his very very very VERY ( add more if you want ) hard for a noob.  I've never played any Moba before so the learning curve was... like this :   - "" Don't go that way  you will be killed. See told ya !""  - "" Why didn't you go that way ? You may have survived ! NOOO NOT THIS W... You're dead.""   - "" USE YOUR FUCKING STICK ! USE YOUR FU... You're dead.""  - "" Why did you go so close to him ? Hopefully I've saved you and... Oh you're dead.""  - "" Please put some wards. Not there. Not there either. There is useless. Don't go th... You're dead goodbye""  - "" Now it's time for your ult... Oh you're dead""   I play mainly CM and support roles and I like it a lot. I see than in every game I play I become better and better I learn stuff everyday about other heroes and theirs capacities. I was told than I must know all the heroes and all theirs spells. Oh and all the items.  It's true. It's damn true. I didn't fully understand the game was so difficult and deep. You must play it to understand.   So there is no main goal in this post just some things I wanted to write and some advices I thought of :   - Find people to play with you alone it's very difficult to understand the game.  - There is no stupid questions only stupid anwsers.  - Wards.  - check your settings there is a lot of nice things you can turn on.  - Sentry.  - Even if the game is about to be lost try harder. Try things try objects and new technics.  - More wards & sentries.  And I also want to thanks my ""teachers"" who gave me the opportunity to learn at my pace this wonderful game and their patience with my stupid noob mistakes.    And you . Why did you start ? Was it hard too ?  EDIT : Wow I didn't think it will generate ""so much"" comments :D Nice to see that the community can have nice conversations sometimes haha ",personal

Update from zoomed in guy,self.DotA2,In case youve never heard of me I played my first 900 hours fully zoomed in. Throughout the past year my friends have shown me several references to the original post about me. [Heres the original  post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3a8179/for_905_hours_my_friend_has_played_fully_zoomed/). I thought it was about time to share how Im doing now.  Back when I played zoomed in I calibrated at 1.7k mmr. After getting a new mouse and realizing you could zoom out I asked my friends if it had always been this way. They told me it could only be done in spectator mode. However after a few more minutes of questioning we realized that I had been playing fully zoomed in for 900 hours.  This enlightenment began my climb to 5k (lol). That summer I climbed to 2.4k and fell back to 2.1k. I stopped playing ranked for a while because of school and not enjoying solo queues. However this summer the International Battle Pass was announced. When I heard that you could receive a new mmr and replace your original with it I immediately purchased the battle pass. I played my first 10 solo games and calibrated at 2.5k only 400 higher than my actual solo. Playing the required 40 games was a nightmare and I legitimately ran out of reports three times. After playing all 40 games I ended up at mid 2.6k. Although this mmr might not seem very high to all of you 9k redditors its a big step forward for me. Climbing almost 1000 mmr from where I started was not easy and seeing this progress motivates me to climb even higher.  If you have any questions feel free to ask them and Ill do my best to answer them. To anyone else trying to raise their 1 or 2k solo stay strong and keep climbing!

Dota has taught me how to be a man,self.DotA2,"What are the most important lessons a father can teach his son? Being a man isn't about muscles and beer instead it's very similar to a set of values. Dota rather than my actual father has put more hair on my chest than any amount of whiskey I've ever consumed.  1. Patience It doesn't matter if your support feeds because your offlane is constantly flaming him for not buying enough wards or if your team picks offlane medusa into an antimage. What matters is that you look at their decisions with calmness and poise. After winning numerous games from refraining to flame and instead being the patient friend who slowly suggests the right path.  2. Strength Strength isn't picking sf mid everygame regardless of any outside circumstances. It's having the courage to adjust to your team's needs. Someone pick lc jungle AND you have a safelane luna? You know there isn't enough farm on the map for your preferred hero so pick something safer.   3. Lovemaking I never recieved the ""birds and the bees"" talk from my father. Instead at 3am on a US west server I encountered a nice canadian man who picked techies. He narrated his entire journey and while the rest of my team muted him I continued to listen. He told me that pleasing a woman is very similar to playing techies. You must know exactly how many mines to place not too much not too little. You must know WHERE to put the mines (he placed a lot of emphasis on this). The most important thing he said what that it isnt all about placing the mines its about looking at your game and seeing how best to change your gameplay to suit that game in particular since every game is different and beautiful in her own way.  TL;DR - im not drinking enough alcohol",personal
With all this hype about Techies I just found out I was the one who gave them their apparently awesome third name 8 years ago. Story time!,self.DotA2,"I don't really know how to prove this as this was a long time ago. 8 years ago when I used to play DotA Allstars on Warcraft 3 in my high school years I posted a suggestion on the forums about giving Techies a third name ([archived forum post here](http://da-archive.com/index.php?showtopic=77704)). Unfortunately the archived forum doesn't show the screenshots but basically I pointed out the third goblin.  Back then Techies were named ""Squee and Spleen"". However the unit model actually had three goblins - the [third one was literally a barrel with two legs running underneath it](http://www.terrariaonline.com/attachments/goblin-sappers-png.8711/) in obvious comedic fashion. Three goblins were even acknowledged in the hero's description/lore but why was there no name? Thus my juvenile self decided to post up a suggestion.  I suggested a list of names and ""Spoon"" became the most popular choice. I pointed this out and waited for ""Squee Spleen and Spoon"" to become a reality.  Fast forward 2.5 years later (2008)...At this point I had stopped playing WC3/DotA for years and was completely unaware my suggestion was finally implemented in [version 6.58](http://www.playdota.com/changelogs/6.58). Notice in the changelog the numbers listed in parenthesis matches the url of my forum post.  Fast forward again almost exactly 8 years later (I actually posted that suggestion July 19 2006! Dang!). By now I have graduated from university. The imminent release of Techies for DotA 2 and realizing that they had a third name made me ponder if I was responsible for giving them their full name. A little bit of research allowed me to find out I was a part of DotA history after all! Even better in one of the Techies dialogue/responses they actually poke a little fun at this: [""They call me Squee!"" ""They call me Spleen!"" ""They don't know I'm here."" ""Who said that?""](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/d/df/Tech_spawn_06.mp3)  ~~The funny thing is I don't like Techies that much - I think their design just doesn't fit into DotA and they're kind of toxic rather than enjoyable/adding to gameplay (Pain in the arse for new players easily counterable for experienced players completely defensive based style leads to annoyingly massive turtling and extending match length).~~ Actually since it's been a very long time since I've seen Techies in action in DotA my opinion is pretty outdated as the game has changed massively over 8 years. I still enjoyed playing them back in high school though. Regardless it's absolutely amazing DotA is still living on throughout all these years. Heck I wouldn't have believed an almost $11 million dollar tournament could even happen with this game (I suppose no one did...truly amazing stuff).  So not that exciting but still cool to me nonetheless. Do you have an interesting story of how you made a suggestion that was actually implemented?   **TLDR:** Almost exactly 8 years (2006) ago [I suggested giving Techies a third name since there's 3 of them](http://da-archive.com/index.php?showtopic=77704). It took the DotA Allstars staff 2.5 years later (2008) to implement this in [version 6.58](http://www.playdota.com/changelogs/6.58). In 2014 I decide to look into my past and found out my suggestion actually did get in and that I'm a part of DotA history woot woot.",personal

EE and Machine - a study in heartbreak and compassion,self.DotA2,"I always have a tough time watching losers interviews especially at highstakes tourneys like TI - and especially with emotional people like Jacky.  But while this interview was short it might have been my favorite that I've ever seen. And here's why:  1) Machine begins with a sincere acknowledgement that he's got a shitty job to do right now. He doesn't shy away from the fact that asking ""what's going through your mind"" is cliched. I really believe that you get what you give and Machine sorta lowering his guard and recognizing the difficulty of the situation helped bring out the most heartfelt response from Envy. Speaking of which -  2) Envy's response. Jesus. One thing that made it incredible imo was that it was clear that he never prepared a statement for this scenario - his singleminded goal is winning every Dota2 game plays. It says fuckton about the type of person that he is. And the response that he DID make in the moment was bracingly honest - getting kicked out of TI is always a career changing moment for a player; as he meandered between his career now his past accomplishments and his future with his team you could almost understand what it feels like to have your whole professional life flash in front of your eyes. I don't know if many of us will ever have an experience as dramatic as that - and especially not live in front of an audience of thousands.  And with all that happening ""I'm not going to quit"" was his first (and INSTANT) reaction. No matter what you think of his play the man is an inspiration.   3) This may be a less significant thing but amidst everything the interactions between EE Machine and the audience really stood out to me. When the cheers came out as EE announced that he wasn't going to quit it was a really touching moment and I'm glad Machine acknowledged it as well. There's no doubt that Envy is a supremely self-motivated person; much of his career has been proving people that didn't believe in him wrong through his own isolated hard work. To see the fans come through especially in a low moment - I'm sure it meant a lot. Just because you're good at struggling alone doesn't mean you don't need love. I hope he gets to hear those cheers as often as he needs - and hopefully under more happy circumstances.  I might be over analyzing this guys but it's just my effort at picking apart why this moment hit me so hard. Good luck Envy. We've got your back.   ~EDIT~ Here's the link for those who missed it - and it's worth rewatching even if you didn't! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL53KAQxdEo",personal
From a New Player -,self.DotA2,>Before I start off this post from the bottom of my heart I really want to thank all of you. I know this sub has it's ups and downs but thank you all for helping my get my footing in this wonderful game.   Last month was not the best for me. I found out that my job was closing down. My son was sick and in the hospital with pneumonia. My wife and I were so stressed that she left the house to stay with her parents so we both could have some alone time from each other and re-center of sorts. I had never felt so alone in my entire life. I felt like everything was crumbling around me and all I could do was watch it happen. I decided to hop on to Reddit for a bit of a distraction and wound up here. I'd played DOTA a little bit when it came out while I was stationed in Korea but not a whole lot since then up until a couple weeks ago. I started looking through some of the posts on here and decided to redownload the game. Hopping into a few bot matches to relearn the game and grab my favorite character (Slark). I decided to pour through the new player posts as well to get as much information as possible so that I could really grasp the game and it's given me such a great escape for me right now. There was a point in time after I redownloaded the game all I did was come home and hop into bot matches and play to get over all of the bullshit that was going on around me. I had recently quit drinking and I'm glad that DOTA grabbed me before the bottle could again which was pretty tempting considering everything else that was going on.   So thank all of you for taking the time to help new players and returning old players alike with this game. It really means the world to me that you guys are such a great community. Sure like any community we have our ups and downs but thank you all very much for being great players. I might still be terrible but DOTA 2 has given me an escape for my PTSD and an escape for when my world was crumbling and giving me something else to focus on. It means the world to me and I'm sure the other new players in the sub as well.   Now a couple of weeks later and I am happy to say that I have found a new job my son and wife are back home and everything is getting patched up nicely.   Thank you guys so much for being a great community and I look forward to playing some of you guys when I finally make that leap into online PVP instead of the kiddie pool with bots!,personal

Guys I need help.,self.DotA2,"So here is when it all started and how it started. On August 12 after Liquid won the Internationals there was a huge surge of people from China/Sea flooding the Toronto Public channel. I don't know why probably to get NA perspective/reaction. They were literally spamming the chat in Chinese. I told them to stop spamming the channel. Next thing I know is I get this notification - ""No one hears you. Your account has been flagged as disruptive and your public chat privileges temporarily revoked."" I got mass reported by Mainland China. As you can tell there's no timer I assumed it was a bug my public chat privileges would come back after a week. It is currently August 23 well over one week. I noticed something was wrong. I decided to investigate and stumbled on this thread http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=282806 -.  Following the instructions the Epoch Converter revealed when my ""temporary public chat ban"" would be lifted: Monday 11 December 2017 01:26:34. My eyes almost popped out of my eye socket.  TLDR: **I've been banned from public channel for five months.** because all of China reported me in a North America public channel. Currently I opened a steam ticket but please keep me in your prayers and donate me an upboat so Volvo can send halp. Please mr /u/DanielJ_Valve  /u/JeffHill Valve I need halp.

Dota 2 Health PSA,self.DotA2,"I don't know where this will end up but I feel the need to say it.  I'm nearly 26.  After about a decade in the military (most of which was sitting down on planes or flying a desk) and the constant draw of playing video games I found myself having quite a bit of a pain in my ass.  Literally!  I went to the doc and they said: ""Well let's do some PT.""  A few months later I'm still in (worse) pain and it turns out I have a bulged disc in my back.      Many injections later and a lot of physical therapy I'm back to relatively normal life but there are some things I can't really ever do again.  I'm paying to get my stuff moved into our new house instead of moving it myself because I don't want to risk another month of excruciating pain.  That's money that could be spent on better things.  Why am I telling you this?    One of the main reasons I think that this happened to me is because I spent a lot of time sitting.  Granted much of that was part of my job but a lot of it had to do with being such a regular PC gamer and not sitting in a good position even after work was over.  I was in pretty decent shape being a Marine and exercising regularly but it was not enough.  So as an old fart with a bad back I just want to put this out there: **take care of yourself**.  Eat well.  Get off TS/Skype/Jabber/Jibber/Yahoo Messenger!/ICQ for a few minutes and stretch.  Tell your buddies you've got something you need to do before the next game or recommend they do the same.  It's not good to sit there bent over the keyboard for hours on end.    I know this all sounds obvious and a bit silly but the fact of the matter is that we have a whole generation that is really into games.  Let's not end up with broken bodies because we were too stubborn to put the next round of *mid or feed* on hold for a few minutes of stretching.  I went to bed last night with the same old pain I have at the end of every day; despite taking far better care of my back now I'll have this pain forever.  I fell asleep thinking of anti-gravity chairs that let you play Dota for as long as you like and never incur injuries that creep up on you like this one.  I'm not smart enough to invent that so I'm making this post.  **TL;DR** Remember to take a break when you're playing Dota eat well stretch and don't let the game run your health into the ground.  **Edit 1**: Wow I did not imagine this would get so much attention!  I am very thankful that the post has brought this subject to the forefront for many of you.  I am also very appreciative of the gold so thank you for that as well!",personal
Fuck you Chinese Dota: To the Shameless Pro Players,self.DotA2,"This is a translation of [the post by  on SGamer](http://bbs.sgamer.com/thread-12870339-1-2.html) posted after the elimination of the Chinese teams in [the Shanghai Major](http://liquipedia.net/dota2/Shanghai_Major/2016).  The post is now under spotlight again following the defeats of three Chinese teams in the DAC breakout round. I thought it would be interesting to share the perspectives of the hardcore Chinese fans here.  ---  ""**This is not funny at all.**"" -- EHOME.GIGABYTE.820.CN  ---  **Day 1**  LGD called GG against MVP in 20 mins.  This is what Zou Yitian said while watching a Dagon Invoker and a triple Vitality Booster Io.  820 was the captain of the legendary EHOME lineup that won 10 championships including the first Dota championship in 2007.  To be honest it was not a surprise that [Newbee](https://i.imgur.com/6D32mPS.png) lost.  The aging Chinese General Hao wasn't even good at last hitting with Spectre his signature hero.  The Immortal God Mu who played RPG all night long was making terrible decisions left and right that led to the crushing defeat.  All the other teams were at best tier 2.  ---  **Day 2**  All the Chinese teams have been eliminated.  **This is so funny.**  Pro players who play RPG all night long   Pro players who ask whether the fans have been given the face to criticize [0]   Pro players who ask whether their professionalism is delicious [1]   Pro players who practise with the fans' moms [2]   Pro players who go doglike whenever playing top ranked games   Pro players who don't know how to play yet refuse to learn [3]   And pro players who get dumpstered in 5000 avg MMR games.  ---  **I am fucking asking are you worthy of anything?**  [This](https://i.imgur.com/eJB6XFj.png) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/kKhO40L.jpg) was the venue after the elimination of both LGD and EHOME. Almost 10 pm at night the audience congregated near the casters to get closer to the stage. No early eviction from the venue today and everyone staying wanted Newbee to win: the majority had already left after the shameful defeat of these two teams. Despite that the crowd that remains was cheering for Newbee when they stepped onto the stage. But **are you worthy of these fans**?  LGD you four **are you worthy of Sylar's form**? Invisible supports talentless mid Batrider that got himself initiated on. Do you know you are playing in a tournament? Facing the Complexity that got dumpstered by EG every single time? Sorry I've forgotten that you've never won against EG in elimination matches. That said as a team that slept until 9:05 how could you even be worthy of a victory over coL who woke up early went to the opening ceremony?  ---  When the MVP players woke up to play ranked games at 6 am you have just gone to sleep. Right? Chinese teams?  While the MVP players were playing solo ranked you were playing and laughing with your girlfriends. Right? Chinese teams?  With what you are gonna win? With an attitude like this?    Of all the teams only \[A\] [did the signing session for the fans](https://i.imgur.com/ZudBRJq.png) that's the attitude of Loda.  Asking (the fans) whether he was performing well as a carry that's also the attitude of Loda.  ---  What in the world are you even practising?  Strategies that can't even win in pub games strategies that make your [carry player play an offlane hero](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2193658590)?  EHOME the ugly performance put on with your Ember during the Radiant Dire Cup. How confident you are!  Pro players who dare not play in high MMR games. Closing your door and building a cart at home is the name of Chinese Dota.  Once known for the strongest mechanical skills what now?   Miss your CS   Lose your lane   Game over in 20 mins!  **Old burdens your skin so thick that no one can even break it!**  ---  [These](https://i.imgur.com/Ev3mddH.jpg) were the boards that I brought to the venue. I held them up for around 20 minutes. Wasn't in a good position to be captured by the live camera. Only a camera guy and a couple random people took pictures of them.  **Chinese Dota you aren't even ashamed of yourself.**  After the elimination of LGD I thought about moving behind the casters (to be captured and streamed). There a VP fan was holding a VP sign. Not wanting to disturb him I decided to stay where I was.  Now that I've thought about it again I gave you you trash pros face by not doing this.  ---  [This](https://i.imgur.com/hCQhkP2.png) is when Newbee called GG after stubbornly fighting into Sven at his peak.  A girl wearing a Newbee jersey was crying.   Countless fans with accents from all over the country were sighing.   And someone on the zebra crossing just outside of the Mercedez-Benz Arena said  # Trash.  ---  [0] When Cty was criticized by some fans he asked ""did I give you face?"" meaning whether he has permitted them to criticize.  [1] When asked by a fan why EHOME didn't go to the opening ceremony and that whether their professionalism had been fed to the dogs Cty replied ""was it delicious?"".  [2] When a fan left a comment under ChuaN's weibo for him to practise more heroes ""I'll practise [with] your mom"" was the reply from ChuaN.  [3] When Maybe was asked whether he plays Meepo he said ""I don't"". When asked whether he'll learn he gave the same response.",personal

Real life tragedy can happen at any time even during Dota,self.DotA2,Last night before bed I usually play a couple of matches of ranked and every once in a while I have a few groups of guys on my friends list that invite me on discord to play if they need to have an open spot filled. I dont know them in real life but we laugh communicate and usually have a solid time whenever they need me to play instead of their main friends.  In the middle of the match one of our teammates said he would be right back so the constant pausing by us and unpausing by the other team ensues with the typical trash talk that we all have grown accustomed too when a pause drags on. His absence grew to a weird amount and we became quite anxious as our lead started to slip away.   He returned to his mic as a barrage of allegations were sent at him as to for why he was gone for so long and why he asked us if one of us could take over his hero disruptive. He then answered in a sullen voice that his wife had a miscarriage and he couldnt continue the match.  To hear of such a horrific tragedy from someone  in real time that Ive never known personally really struck my heart and reminded me that even though video games are  escapism for many users real life can come at you at any moment. I feel terrible for this person Ive only known as a steam username and I hope his wife and family will be able to recover from the loss of a child. I hope this story will motivate everyone to treat people in Dota a lil bit better since you have no idea what they are going through or what can happen to them in a moments notice.  Edit: Hey its great to see people being able to open up about hard topics that have happened in their lives.  As a community that is interested in dota its only right that we can care and show support for people we know and strangers online if something happens big or small.,personal

Valve will you please open your eyes to the relation between losing monthly active players and the performance issues?,self.DotA2,It's pretty clear to me after some topics here on this subreddit that one of the major reasons behind Dota 2's number of players been decreasing is the recent performance issues and the frustration of the players for not having the same FPS they had before.   I'll take my country as an example: Brazil is a shit country and he wave very little money to buy eletronics they're really expensive related to some average income of the population. Eletronics here have really huge taxes and stuff like that... It's kinda rare when a person actually have money to play on 5-core 3.3GHz processor with the latest dedicated video card... most people actually don't have money to own a desktop AND a laptop so they go just for the laptop instead.   I would say that out of 100 people that play games here in Brazil we have **at least** 60 playing League and like 10 playing dota TOPS. And what's really interesting behind this approximated number is that League can run on a steady 60fps without drops on team fights all options to medium on a i3-6100u laptop (as confirmed by myself). While dota *barely* goes higher than 50 dire base is like 35 and team fights i have 25 or something and it's impossible to actually click and stun a weaver with her new shukuchi movespeed talent.  I can guarantee at least in my country that performance is a major reason why people pick valve's number 1 rival instead of Dota 2. **EVERY** laptop can run League not every laptop can run dota 2 and the higher you go on the laptop specs less people can play the game,personal

So I bought the Winter 2017 BP yesterday (laugh all you want),self.DotA2,Hi guys Before you down vote me for being a mentally retarded f** please hear me out.  I know that technically Winter ends in February so I was worried about buying above pass and I did a quick google search to be told that the next battle pass would be coming out in time for the TI7 meaning that I would have roughly 3 months to do all the good quests that are included in the BP.  Unfortunately after buying it and activating it I'm helpfully told that me pass has expired.  Three days before it was bought in fact.  To be quite honest I find this unacceptable.  There was no indication on the store page that the pass had expired or indeed any mention of when it was going to expire.  I contacted valve in order to get a refund but apparently because I've activated it I can't get a refund. I don't know about in the US but in the EU it is illegal for a supermarket to sell out of date products and that is essentially what Valve is doing here without any warning of such.  Nice one Valve.  If someone can help me out tell me what I can do with an expired BP and not laugh *to* hard.  Thanks  EDIT: fixed formatting  EDIT 2: Big thanks to everyone who up voted this!  I managed to catch Valve's eye and get a full refund so all is good.  Also a big thanks to the Dota 2 team.  You guys rock!,personal
SirActionSlacks owes me a Jugg set.,self.DotA2,On December 13 of 2014 back in the days before SirActionSlacks was a some Big-shot host of dota I decided to watch this pug filled stream with around 350 viewers. Low and behold near the time that I got on a giveaway was happening. SirActionSlacks said that his random name generator wasnt working so instead he randomly picked a name from the list of viewers. Low and behold I won! I was overjoyed - never did I win such things.   &nbsp;   He said to message him and he would give me the set. Of course I did right away. I was quite ecstatic as you can see in the [message](http://imgur.com/gallery/rrPdw). However I recieved no reply. Disappointed I gave him a few days to respond before trying again.  &nbsp;   On the 17th of December I proceeded to send Mr. Slacks [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/2HkNq) in the hope this was all some misunderstanding. Again no reply. I decided I was never receiving the Jugg set and moved on with my life albiet my hopes in the goodness of the world crushed. Never again did of think of that silly jugg set.  &nbsp;   That is until I had the unique opportunity to attend The International in the year of 2016. There I saw the same man who never gave me the fairly won Jugg set bouncing around on stage looked upon as a pillar of the community. Not only that but he the team which he subbed for ended second place - his moment of triumph only made my moment worse.  &nbsp;   I returned home after said International and after a few waning weeks of summer I could stay silent no longer. I'm allowing the whole community to see the man for what he really is - A person who does not give out sets to people who improperly contacts him using the shitty twitch messaging system.  &nbsp;  EDIT: I don't want a jugg arcana please don't give me one. Mr. Slacks I quite appreciate the reply. For full disclosure me winning the jugg set was something I felt quite guilty about. It was the first and last time I ever went on your stream and the only reason I won was because when you said the random user thing doesnt work you decided to scroll down to the bottom of the viewer list and pick that person. I was at the bottom because I believe I may have been one of the most recent people to join the stream. Hence why I also didn't know any of the rules for how to get an item when you win - I didn't come to your stream to read I came for some 3k Dotes Kappa. Anyways you just said message me so not knowing Twitch messaging was absolute dog shit (The two messages I sent to you are the only two I have ever sent or received) I didn't know to message you anywhere else. I am just a lowly pleb with no knowledge of such things. I fixed my above post to better reflect the current situation.  &nbsp;  EDIT 2: I have an idea if slacks is agreeable. I have no interest in any actual item or set at this point - Slacks recognition that I did indeed win was enough for me. I feel validated. However Slacks if you would agree perhaps to do another giveaway and give away the item that was one day meant for me I would be much appreciated. Glad we could both make sweet and non-aggressive ^^kappa posts to get to the best solution possible :D.,personal

Want to surprise gf by quitting DotA how hard is it?,self.DotA2,*Actual edit*: Yo I'm not quitting Dota I thought this was pretty obviously a parody / shitpost of the other post about the gf wanting to start Dota for her bf. If anyone is actually finding it difficult to quit Dota scroll to the bottom of the comments. There's a shit load of advice. I'm just a single dude that is happily playing some dotes.  _____  Hi  Just a trashy pub player here with plenty of Dota 2 experience since before TI3 4 years ago. However my gf is a regular person and hates DotA and so Im always sneaking twitch streams and ranked games from her.  I kinda want to try to quit playing so that I can surprise her as well as be more productive so that I can work a normal job and finish my degree. I just feel tentative to quit because I understand how normal human beings don't talk to each other in twitch memes and Im afraid that Ill be so awkward ( haHAA *cringe* haHAA ) people will hate me. It also looks like a fun time not playing Dota 2 all day so Id like to try but I know I will just reinstall it again so Im worried about that too. Any advice?  Edit: Thank you for all your advice and input I appreciate it so much! I will definitely give uninstalling Dota 2 a try and keep to regular social situations at first until I can stop talking like Arteezy (wE acUTALUY fCKHing LoST gET ME OUUT). Then over time when I can talk to people confidently Ill tell her and I think it would be a nice unexpected surprise. Its really way out of my comfort zone. My hobbys gaming and hers is makeup so I think shell have a good laugh.  Edit 2: Wow I woke up to this which blew up more than I thought it would so thank you! Ill honestly give quitting a try from this post alone because the community has been much more open to the idea of me leaving Dota 2 forever than I thought. And to answer some of your questions my gf doesnt reddit! So she wont see this post. See were opposite in the way that Im on reddit when Im on the toilet and what she does is just take a shit wipe her ass and leave like people have been doing for millenia.,personal

I believe in Alliance.,self.DotA2,EHOME vs Alliance for their next match. Ehome is unstoppable most wins out of any team on either group. So many people believe this is the end for them that Alliance is surely to fall into the lower bracket.  But I believe in Alliance.  My boys have been through too much after TI4. EGM leaving S4 leaving even the Dongmeister taking a break. The Swede Stack looked broken; but here they are in their full might. Group stage was shaky; they were on the verge of being in lower bracket.  But I believed in Alliance.  And as if to answer my prayer they pulled off the craziest comeback in TI6 as of yet and managed to secure Upper Bracket; only to now have to face Ehome.   But I believe in Alliance.  I'm too invested in this team to give up. My life expectancy probably has gone down by 10 years because of this but I'm in too far to pull out now: it's balls deep or nothing.   I believe in Alliance.  I always tell my teammates this when they start calling GG 20 mins in: The game isn't over until our Ancient is dead. How can we win if we don't believe that we will?  So I believe in Alliance.  And I'll keep on believing until my last dying breath. Alliance will win TI6. ALLIANCE WILL WIN TI6. And even if they don't I'll be damned if they don't provide us some of the most interesting matches of the tournament.   I BELIEVE IN ALLIANCE.  Loda Akke S4 EGM Bulldog I believe in you. Never give up hope for you'll always have ours. I'm an Alliance fangay and I'm proud of it. There are thousands of us proud to bear the Alliance flair. And although I believe you guys can win that's not why I root for you. You are my favorite team not just because of skill but because you care about having fun because you care about why we started playing Dota in the first place. I never have as much fun watching other teams play as I have when watching you guys.   I believe in Alliance.  In my heart Alliance was never back. Because Alliance was never gone in the first place.   I believe in Alliance.,personal
I am the support. I am the Captain of S.S. Dumbfuck.,self.DotA2,"For the first time in four days I decided it's time to play ranked again. I queued up Europe West/East. Almost 5 minutes huh? I am this special? The bans begun. I ban Tinker as always because FUCK Tinker. Picking phase. My hopes to play Omniknight got dashed enemy instalocks Enigma first. I go for Rubick. Mostly because it's a direct counter but this is the hero I know the best and played the most. Enemy goes for Slark Clinkz and Bloodseeker. Wow this is gonna be hell of a ride.  The game starts. I tell my teammates on voip to be careful this game since the enemy has 3 strong ganking heroes. I lane with Void against the Clinkz. My partner last hits alright but I am unable to zone the enemy since he beats the shit out of me with Searing Arrows. I gave first blood because of that. Quick TP back warding the jungle and securing the 2:00 rune but soon I realize I won't be able to do much in this lane and that Void is doing his passive farm alright without my help. I grab the haste rune and rotate top where Drow Ranger feeds regularly to Slark Lion and Bloodseeker. We kill Bloodseeker. Top lane becomes much more quiet since I'm there. I remind my teammates using microphone that our plan this game is to survive and wait for the late game. I decide to build Arcane Boots and Mekansm since I am the only support in my team.  Minutes pass by with me trying to stop Slark from free farming top as unexpectedly everyone else left the top lane. 4 enemies devour our safelane Void. Then things go fully haywire. A real clusterfuck on bot while I lane top against the alone Slark. Wait a minute I think as a support I should be there even though this lane is deserted by our team. I TP bot we take the tower. Things start to look good to us Invoker is getting the kills and he pushed mid tower already too. We look at enemy top T1 and move there. We start pushing together against a lone support then Enigma with Bloodseeker rotate and gank the shit out of us. Not good. Invoker dies. This is about 15 minute mark. He disconnects. First thought - Ragequit. I check his Steam profile. Mongolia. Maybe the electricity died in his entire village I say to myself. We pause. The enemy unpauses and starts throwing insults in Russian. We pause again and I ask them to wait using the very basic Russian I learned in school back in the days. ""Podozdi on vyernulsya"". They don't want to pause and insult us again.  Drow feeds some more. I tell Void that he's the carry now with Invoker out and Drow not showing much promise. He farms safely bot and in the jungle while we are being punished very hard on other lanes. Good the late game will come and that's where he's going to shine. The guy who plays Spirit Breaker starts to play Invoker too now that the other guy has abandoned the match. He isn't doing well. We start to lose the territory and being ganked every time. Things are getting worse every minute.  I maintain the vision with observers and sentries on two lanes and defensively in the jungle and tell my teammates that this is where we have to stay. For the next 20 minutes. We need to survive till the late game while carries will get the farm. We need Drow and Void to get so big they will stomp the enemy. Meanwhile the Drow is dying again. Void is getting impatient. He writes: ""REPORT DROW"". All in caps someone's upset. ""Why is that?"" I ask. ""0/8"" he types. ""This is not a valid reason for report"" I reply calmly. ""Look I know you are angry but she's doing her best okay? Things are gonna be good. Just wait for the late game but this is not going to happen until next twenty minutes"". The guy playing Spirit Breaker asks me if he can play Invoker too. I tell him it's okay as long as he knows what he's doing. I finish Guardian Greaves. I know we're gonna need them.  We play defensively and occasionally kill Slark or Clinkz when they try to attack alone from invisibility. We have sentries no way they are gonna succeed as long as we stick together. They finally try to push the highground. We wait it out and pick them one by one when they do so. When my guys are trying to chase I use the voip to call them back. This is not safe with invisible enemy trying to lure us in an ambush. They listen to me and we feed a lot less from now on. Drow Ranger reminds us to save some money for buybacks. I ask Void can he buy me sentries since I want to have money for buyback. He gets me like 20 of them. The Spirit Breaker guy plays Invoker very well and his Tornado - Deafening Blast - Meteor combos help us a lot!  The things are getting more intense. The late game is getting closer and their assaults are getting more fierce. Enigma uses Blackhole a few times but he has no BKB so I interrupt it easily then steal it. One of such attacks I catch 4 of them in a stolen Blackhole then Void uses Chronosphere. Epic and easy! I am able to buy the Scythe of Vyse thanks to the money we earned by defending.  The game goes very late. After 50-60 minute mark Void and Drow are much stronger than the entire enemy team! We wipe them out a few times. I command who has to stay and who pushes (we lost mid racks and bot highground tower already). We get their racks one after one during such wipeouts. We play safe because nobody wants to lose. Finally we got megacreeps. The tension is huge. We kill them. They buyback. We kill them again. We get to the ancient!  I shout ""We did it! We did it! Wooooo!"" on the mic while the enemy ancient crumbles. Void types in caps: ""ALL COMMEND RUBICK""... The proud of myself and my teammates is overwhelming me.  Thank you Slacks for showing me how important the communication using the microphone is in this game. Thank you the Spirit Breaker player *seekm3* for playing two heroes at once (I checked his Dotabuff and it turned out he plays mostly Invoker). Thank you my team for trusting me and believing in the victory!  The match on Dotabuff: http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2704789550  TL;DR: I won the ranked game 4 vs 5 because one guy played two heroes because I led my team using the microphone because we waited til the late game and because the enemy was a team of tryhard CIS-countries ragers and I wanted to share my story.",personal
The most adorable thing happened today,self.DotA2,"I wanted to play a little with 2 mates that havent really played a lot of dota so I logged into an alternative account to play some unranked with them.  In this game however there was a little ukranian kid he sounded like he was 11-12 years old or something in his mic and he instant picked pudge and wanted to go mid. He had Dendis set also. He was so happy that he managed to pick pudge so he went nuts saying ""YES"" ""PUDGE)))"" ""IM PUDGE"".  At first I thought ""ohgod.jpg"" because that dosent usually end up very well but we let him go mid because whatever he actually tried to communicate in english with us the best he could.  He did actually very ok from himself rotated a lot and got some great hooks everytime he got a hook he cheered ""YES"" ""HOOK"" ""DENDI HOOK"" and wrote ""hooks)"". ""OPA)"". ""OYOYYOOYOY)""  His joyfullness of getting a good hook with pudge made him so happy everytime.  It was actually a very fun game to play. I then looked at his steam profile and his profile picture seemed to be a photo of him holding a photo of Dendi and that was so adorable. I dont remember what he nicked it was something in cryllic letters so I cant find his profile.  But that was so adorable meeting such a fan from Dendi like that in a pub totally killed the CIS-player stereotype.  I just wanted to share this story. Peace.",personal

Everything I know about Dota is wrong,self.DotA2,"I just played a low priority game on US West English where I was literally the only English speaker in the game. Everyone else was speaking spanish or not talking at all.  We had an insta-pick invoker who called mid and someone who picked meepo. We also had an ogre magi who was constantly DCing  They were all good. I can't believe it but they were good. Our invoker did his best to communicate with the team and plan out what we were doing even using broken english to try to include me. He and ogre magi made my tiny so powerful by keeping alacrity and bloodlust on during teamfights. Meepo didn't feed and in fact ended the game with the best score of anyone.   At the end invoker said ""commend tiny"" and I swear I almost broke down crying guys. My world has been turned upside down.  edit: 627705010",personal

I've been playing for 3 days. I'm a total newb but I'm getting there. I'd like to thank all the people who helped me.,self.DotA2,"A couple of days ago I created [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3akp50/im_new_how_do_i_find_people_to_play_with/) asking for people to play with.  Well my inbox lit up and I have over 20 friends now.  This game is amazing.  Until the last game I just played I'd probably say 'this game sucks.'  I kept dying and people kept flaming me.  Well one of the people from the thread decided to coach me and well... jeez was that fun.    I picked a core for the first time Viper and he was giving me tips.  I was following his instruction but I still ended up dying in mid lane.  To make matters worse they had a Riki who knew what he was doing.  I didn't know what I was doing.  I just remember at one point my coach saying:  ""If Riki attacks you step out of the smoke and turn and ult him and you can take him.""  ""Riki just bought item A you're going to need a monkey king bar.""  ""You can't turn and face Riki anymore if he attacks you just shadowblade away.""  ""Riki just bought a Rapier this game is over... you don't want to be out on the map.""  As soon as Riki got the Rapier they 5 manned us and attacked us mid lane and that's when something spectacular happened.  As they were raxxing us Mid lane our Doom went out and pushed their base and took out two sets of rax.  Before doing this Doom left a gift at the base he bought a Gem of Truesight.  Upon respawning I picked up the Gem and went on the hunt for Riki with my monkey king bar shadowblade and gem.  I ran into Riki right at the river in middle lane and he was all alone.  I ulted him and spammed Q and he died and dropped his rapier and I picked it up.  All of a sudden the Rapier is on our side and now they're on the defensive.  I was so scared.  My heart was racing.  I didn't want to lose the Rapier or the Gem.  Everytime I saw someone I shadowbladed and ran away.    We ended up winning the game and my coach was stunned.  He was sure we were going to lose.  Riki went 36-8 or 38-6 and we still managed to win.  Never did my heart race so much during a video game.  This game is amazing.    **edit: thanks so much for the replies my inbox has exploded.  I can't add you guys because my steam account is level 0.  I'll try to buy a compendium tonight so I can add people.

Dota 2 never cease to amaze me! Tricks that blows my mind!,self.DotA2,There are always new things to learn even after 3000 hours into the game.    Just last week i learned about Chen send back creeps trick and it blows my mind. Chen can send 3 melee creeps back for the offlane at 0 minute mark. The offlaner can get solo exp of full creep wave and reach level 2 before 1 minute mark. This trick works so well in current meta. Some self-sufficient offlaners such as timber/weaver/lc benefit so much from the early level advantage against enemy tri-safelane.    And last night while watching singsing stream a techies player in his team use a very interesting trick that i have never think of in my whole life of doto. Offlaner Techies use suicide at level 1 to kill creepwave and gain level 2. TP to lane use proximity mine on creepwave and then proceed to stand ON TOP of the mine. Enemy melee carry can't right click the mine due to techies hitbox is protecting the mine hitbox. Besides who would have imagine that a carry will lose laning phase 1v1 against a techies. Normal techies will just plant mines on trees and feed extra gold to carry.   How the hell people keep coming up with these neat tricks? What have i done with my life? ,personal

I respect Valve so much,self.DotA2,I don't think there is any other company which deny possibilities to earn a lot of money just by copying their old work.  They could just do similiar battlepass as each before and they could earn milions $ easly they could just give us weekly BattleCup even with small rewards and i think they still could earn a lot from tickets.  But this is Valve. I trust them so much that they will release when it's done which will be much better than any other battlepass before.  Some may say that this is laziness but i am sure that Valve has greater plan about their games what we don't know now.,personal

I introduced my 11 yo niece to DotA,self.DotA2,And her 15 yo friend at the same time. I was visiting my hometown for Christmas and I saw them playing the game that should not be named. We reminisced how she was watching me play it (yes dark times) in the past and I suggested that they try out DotA. So they download steam and the game and the ~shit~show began.   They have never used steam so partying up  was the first hurdle to overcome. We tried adding via steam profile links (I taught them how to use Discord but that's a different story). We tried a local chat channel in DotA a user channel even a PRIVATE channel (where you have to specifically add the person in question via a command). None worked because their accounts were obviously restricted. Really Valve? Okay we even somehow managed to find each others DotA profiles though I'm not sure how. Honestly at that point I was on the verge of giving up and assuming that Valve considers new Steam/DotA players so irrelevant that they don't give a damn about those 2 unlikely players. BUT it turned out you can add a player via DotA ID... to friends. It obviously didn't work but we managed to party up with that feature. So... all this was nothing compared to what happened afterwards. It's hard to put into words but I'll try my best.   We kicked off with the tutorial. They have both finished the first part albeit cluelesly even though they play the L game. Then came the DK game and oh boy... I can't remember the last time I felt so helpless and ashamed about something. The tutorial is GARBAGE. A big stinking pile of crap. It's like being praised for graduating kindergarten as a kid after the first mission followed by solving damn integrals in the second. Honestly what the hell? They both lost interest immediately after being thrown into such deep water. Two new fresh souls young eager grills beaten by a frigging tutorial.  My niece said that it's hard (no surprise here) and that she will maybe play when I visit again in the future but she'd much rather only watch. She also said that her biggest problem was with a lack of camera lock on your hero.   Valve please you can do better than this start from allowing players to add each other to a party at least! followed by a community-driven arcade based tutorial contest for eager modders. If you didn't mind dumping 30k on Frostivus surely you can spend as much on a proper tutorial with basic concepts and mechanics explained? You can treat it as an investment into new players. For all those that lasted till the end thank you for reading. Proof here: https://imgur.com/a/VMoE1   TL;DR New Steam/DotA players can't party up easily and are being discouraged by the garbage quality tutorial.,personal

It's a problem that is beyond Valve and contributing to ruined games. People who play frequently will inevitably experience this unfortunate circumstance where an individual pulls out his credit card because he feels ""entitled"" to a higher MMR bracket. It's affecting players who are genuinely good but can't break the impenetrable doge shit barrier because a simple 4000 MMR account costs you between $10-15.

The Manila Major: A thank you to the community,self.DotA2,Hello everyone  After months of planning designing building and tinkering The Manila Major has reached its conclusion.  We've had 8 days filled with amazing moments. The close calls incredible comebacks flawless executions and flat out brawls showed us that Dota 2 is in a very good place right now.  We were fortunate enough to have an incredible crowd here in the Mall of Asia Arena as well as some very vocal fans online that pointed out the things we could improve on.  Thank you Valve for trusting us to host an event worthy of your expectations. We had a blast here in Manila and we hope everyone enjoyed The Manila Major as much as we did making it.,shoutout

Valve Event advertising - THANKS GABE,self.DotA2,First of all thank you Gabe.  Thank you for keeping the advertising out of Valve sponsored events.  I know that must have been a hard decision.  In my mind I can see the decision polarize your team but my god it is THE BEST way to go.   You have no idea how great it is to be able to watch TI6 without constant advertisements.  To be able to switch streams without twitch advertisements.  To be able to watch highlights on YouTube without watching a 30 second commercial.   To not have to hear the casters say Purge what are the Monster Energy statistics on that game   Thank you for not charging for this  for not making Valve events a Pay-Per-View | MAIN EVENT.   And thank you for giving us hats to pay for the privilege of having an advertisement free event  wow. You may not hear it enough from fans but this means the world to me.  Corporate sponsors distract and cheapen sporting events.   Thank you Valve Thank you Gabe  Edit value for valve ,shoutout

Came from /r/all - Never watched or played DOTA2 before - That was some Olympics-level entertainment...,self.DotA2,I've heard about dota2 and LoL but I've never played either.  I'm 30 years old and haven't played a serious game since WoW's Lich King expansion.   The most hardcore game I play these days is Clash Royale on iOS lol  Anyway I stumbled into that championship tonight via front page and this video linked on the side was INCREDIBLY helpful: [First Timer's Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_L4Q_FRcyY)  Even though I only discovered the video to help me understand what I was watching mid-way through game 2 I had a **blast** watching and will definitely watch more in the future.  COOL STUFF! idk \\\_()_/   *Big takeaways (maybe y'all will find these fun?)*:   - Twitch chat is God awful.   - I think people hate Void? Whatever that is? OP? idk   - I basically just spent the whole time watching health bars at the top of the screen rather than the action in the middle.  It was giving me seizures and I didn't understand the chaos anyway lol   - THE FANS ARE NUTS!   - Lastly you have something like 100+ characters? wtf is wrong with all of you that you subject yourselves to this kind of chaos?  I can't imagine trying to learn the ins and outs to be prepared to fight against them all.    **tl;dr**: Came from /r/all watched a good newbies guide to watching dota2 had shittons of fun.  *Edit*: Dang and I wake up to 2.4k upDOTAs front page of your sub and a ton of return love.

Appreciation post for Kaci Aitchison,self.DotA2,I personally believe such a post should be here because Kaci Aitchison has been absolutely fantastic to watch over the past few TI's. I'll try touching on some of the things she has been doing for the viewers and fans alike.    From being an unknown backstage host without any prior knowledge of the game  due to which she got trolled by all the casters (especially Iceiceice) in her first gig to being one of the most hyped up cheerful and pleasent personalities of the International talent Kaci has definitely left a mark on the Dota2 community.    By no means am I implying that the other talent has not been outstanding but this TI I realized  that she has been a DotA outsider who gave up a great chunk of herself to assimilate into this community all the while being excellent at the way she has handled her interactions with pro players the crowd and the fans.   I can't begin to imagine how tough backstage hosting would have been at this year's International given she has been pregnant for more than a few weeks and she literally used that fact to make people laugh numerous times which is a wonderful and heartwarming thing.  Kaci if you ever read this I really wanted to give a shout out to all your contributions and how terrific you have been over the years and I believe the DotA community feels the same way. I wish you the best of health in the coming years and hope I somehow get a chance to meet you in person. You are an absolutely wonderful personality to watch :).,shoutout
The Boston Major: A thank you to the community,self.DotA2,Hello everyone  After an incredible six day journey The Boston Major has come to an end. We witnessed epic teamfights outstanding solo plays insane team coordinations and almost sacrificed ODPixel and our hearts on the altar of the 3rd game of the Grand Final.  Post-Manila the expectations for the next Major were sky-high and the pressure to deliver higher than ever. There were some missteps along the way but we learned a lot in the process and we're grateful for the support and feedback we have received during the event.  So thank you Boston for having us and thank you Valve for trusting us again.  We hope everyone enjoyed the show and we'll see you again in April 2017 in beautiful Kyiv (Kiev).,shoutout

Dota 2 has the best sound design of any video game ever made,self.DotA2,"I want to bake a cake and give gifts to the sound engineers who work on Dota. Can someone help me find out who they are? Do they still work at Valve? If so I could just send gifts to the Valve office addressed to ""Aural Geniuses"" and I'm sure they'd figure it out...  Listen to some of hlgf's amazing Dota 2 sound effect remixes while I rave. [Witch Doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZYgqBp1gI) [Cogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEX0s6weKA0) [Enchantress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80pBvl_gPI4)   &nbsp;  As a fogie way too old for this subreddit I have played thousands of video games. I cannot name a single game that comes remotely close to Dota's calibre of sound design. It is in a class of its own.  Almost every interaction has a unique distinguishable and memorable sound effect. You can listen to a teamfight like a radio and identify every hero involved. You can use the clear sounds of enemy spells to mentally mark them as on cooldown. You can use the clear sound of your ally Io's spells to identify when they are attempting to relocate-grief you into the enemy fountain allowing you to quickly -disablehelp.  Other games have homogenous sound effects for movement attacks spells. In Dota the scant few homogenous sound effects are *jarring* when they occur because the user expects uniqueness. For example: Have you ever flinched when your ally Dazzle walked by thinking it was an enemy Pudge? The jingle of the chains is the same. That we even notice this ""bug"" is a testament to the value of Dota's sound.  When Iron Talon was first released on the test client it went through three iterations of its sound effect before going live. Items like Buriza which previously had no unique on-hit sound effect have had them added in. What game company *does* that?  The product director who set the principle of requiring unique and melodious sound effects for each interaction is a genius. Who is responsible for this glory? Is it Icefrog himself?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I will now proceed to list sound effects which you will subvocalize whether you like it or not.   * Clarity Potion * Unstable Concoction * Darkness * Omni's hammer autoattack sound (hint from Icefrog to only play him as a carry) * Sniper's memetic voice * Tower autoattack * A melee creep scraping its shortsword on your 1k MMR flesh * Sanity's Eclipse * Refraction blocking a damage instance * Bristleback procing 322 simultaneous Quillspray instances due to a damage loop bug * Mango * Mask of Madness * Timbersaw whiffing Timberchain ^""They're ^gonna ^get ^me"" * Requiem of Souls * Axe's Culling Blade (*We've recently taken action against one or more players you've previously reported for bad conduct. You have received an additional report submission to use. Thanks for your help in making the Dota 2 community a friendlier place.*) * The ""Three Two One"" Respawn Hymn * Meep Mop   &nbsp;  Thank you.",shoutout
20 Billion Trees? Maybe this is about raising awareness,self.DotA2,According to [this](http://time.com/4019277/trees-humans-deforestation/) article we cut down about 15 billion trees every year (someone already posted it 1-2 days ago). There are somewhat 400 billion trees on our planet according to recent estimates.  Maybe not intended but looking at this from an environmental perspective the current tree challenge actually shows how much 20 billion is. It's a huge number! And yet we as humans almost are able to cut down 15 billion trees a year. That's a huge ass pile of trees.  So while enjoying the virtual deforestation maybe spend a few minutes a day and try to think about how you could actually lower the number of trees cut per year.  Maybe you want to support financially helping out great projects that support reafforestation or help save certain regions on this planet from overexploitation or even illegal depletion.  Maybe you want to support this cause by looking at your everyday consumption of paper-based things like packaging printing paper etc.  Maybe you want to contribute by simply raising awareness.   **Here is my challenge for you**: as a species with common interest in survival and conservation of wildlife respectively nature itself: help to cut down less than 15 billion trees per year.  Save the trees save lives!  Make the world great again!   ,shoutout

The Kiev Major - A thank you to the community,self.DotA2,"Hello everyone   The Kiev Major has concluded with yet another trophy is in the bag for OG. Anybody start to see a pattern here?   Going into the event we knew that this was going to be the most challenging one that we've done on this scale mainly due to the fact that for the first time our production team was going to be split between Kiev and Bucharest.   And while some of the things that we were expecting to go wrong actually didn't the technical side ended up rougher around the edges than we would have liked.   That said one of the things that **did** go according to plan were the Mischiefs at the Major segments. The concept behind them was to have enough content so we wouldn't have any breaks whatsoever during the main event.   Which is why the Kiev Major has become the first in history with no breaks during the main event. That's over **60 hours** of broadcast over just **four days**.   Speaking of which... what the hell was up with those series? Best of 3s for all their money's worth right from the group stage 60+ minutes games... seriously?!?   After day two the callouts in the production room devolved into ""*Yo let's get ready with the cameras they're pushing high ground! / What's the in-game timer? / 28:15 / GTFO of this channel call me again when we're at around the 55 minute mark*"".    And sure enough 30 minutes later we were getting ready for the end of the game. Nostradamus would have been proud.   Not that we complain. If long broadcast days are the price we have to pay for series like Secret or EG vs SG e-sports and this Grand Final so be it. We can take the heat.   So thank you for being patient with us for the support and the dedication to follow the event all the way through the late hours of the night both in the arena and online.   You're the reason we do what we do.",shoutout

Torte De Lini Appreciation Thread,self.DotA2,The highly anticipated In-Client Hero Build system is almost upon us and it is a feature that we have been sorely missing as a community for a long time.   In the dark and harrowing times where making Hero Builds for the current patch was hard and tedious we had one particular individual who has led us through the years. A shining beacon of knowledge in the guide tabs a man who has dedicated so much of his time in order to bring us up to date hero builds every patch as the seasons have come and gone. Yes I am referring to the one and only /u/TorteDeLini.  Torte has been making hero builds for years that have helped guide players item choices and to formulate how a hero is played with his helpful notes on the items and skills. He has even participated at the recent TI7 and was in charge of the Newcomers Stream that helped to foster new interest in our game and community.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank /u/TorteDeLini for his reliability and his dedication in making hero builds every single major patch for the past few years. He has done so much for our new players and even experienced ones alike and now with the coming update to the Hero Build system we will probably see a rise in many different builds once more.  Ive read the patch notes and I really love the changes that are coming and I am also excited for the professional Dota matches that are to follow.  The future looks bright for this community! Even brighter than KoTLs Blinding Light  Edit: Torte also loves feedback so feel free to check out /r/HeroBuilds or his Discord Server: https://discord.gg/fQmUjGU,shoutout

An icefrog apriciation thread,self.DotA2,I only started playing dota about a year and half ago but in the last few days i went digging into the history of dota and i would like to thank icefrog a TON.  When pendragon and guinsoo left DotA-allstars to work on LoL Icefrog stayed and managed the game with Neichus and a bit later alone for about 5 years even thought he couldve PROBABLY gone to work on LoL. After pendragon closed the Original dotaallstars site down icefrog created a new site (playdota) for the people playing dota so he can continue taking ideas and feedback from the community. There were a LOT of attemps to get icefrog to stop working on dota so LoL would have a monopoly but he didnt give up on the game.  All in all i would like to thank and appriciate icefrog for all the dedication he has given dota and dota 2 in the last decade and cannot wait for his future work!

TI5 - Anyone else notice the lack of commercials? I think it has gone unrecognized and IMO i am happy they are not around.,self.DotA2,"For everyone complaining about valve and just taking our money. I am sure they could have a great opportunity to put out mad amounts of commercials and in between sponsors. But they haven't. The content is all there and they are just talking about dota. I am sure this is a luxury of having a major tournament put on by a massive corp.   Please note: This is nothing against tournaments that do have commercials or ""words from our sponsors"" moments. Since they most likely require the revenue to put on the event. And it most likely isn't feasible to put on an event without support from sponsors.   Just a thought. So in a way props to valve.

Dear people of Manila,self.DotA2,I traveled from Adelaide South Australia and have spent the last 10 days in Manila attending the major for the last 6 of those days. You have been so welcoming so nice and so fucking hype it's unbelievable.   I had people stop me in the street and ask if I was here for DOTA and when I said yes they would talk to me about favorite heroes mmr and best teams. When done talking about DOTA you would then tell me all the cool tourist things to do and where to eat.  So from the bottom of my heart thanks for 10 of my best days I hope you get another major next year because I'll definitely come back.,shoutout
Midas mode is one of the best additions to DotA,self.DotA2,Thank you to all of Moonduck for this amazing experience.

Fear Appreciation Thread,self.DotA2,It seems fairly clear the Old Man of DotA is retiring after the 'Legacy' tweet. 1x Aegis 2x 3rd will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest players of all time for consistency and dedication. Show some love for the living legend.   Edit: ~~May take the thread down soon as Charlie has tweeted 'Just fucking wait'. May just be that EG the Org disbanded and Zai/Fear left due to the team no longer having that name. Shall wait and see.~~  Yeah I think it's real as no personalities or Fear himself have said anything otherwise. GL Fear BibleThump  ,shoutout
Thank you to Valve and the Make-A-Wish foundation,self.DotA2,Hello /r/dota2.  I'm a 17 year old Dota enthusiast from central Missouri USA.  In November 2013 I was diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma on my left hip. For those of you who don't know that's cancer. That completely freaked out my family and I and we did not know how to react. That was the start of  25 doses of radiation seven multiple day hospital stays for chemotherapy and two major surgeries. As of a month ago I'm officially done with treatment and now waiting for my hair and eyebrows to grow back.    It's taken a long time but it has been a lot easier with all the support from my friends family and people I don't know who have heard my story and wanted to help. People brought me gifts provided meals for my family and donated items like a new laptop to keep me from being bored in the hospital. My oncologist being the great guy that he is referred me to the Make-A-Wish Foundation and I applied for a wish. The Wish Granters (yes that's what they're called) granted me my wish to go to the International.  It was great that Valve helped out by donating passes for my brother and I to go to all 4 days of the tournament in KeyArena. I wanted to post this to publicly thank Valve and the Make-A-Wish Foundation for giving our family a great way to celebrate the end of my treatment and hopefully my cancer. If you see me at TI4 (I'm the bald kid with no eyebrows) come say hi.  **tl:dr** I had cancer Valve and Make-A-Wish let me go to TI4 for free.  **EDIT:** I would really like to thank xCesme for giving me a Dagon for Nyx Assassin. What a nice gesture.,shoutout

This Summit feels like a love letter to the community.,self.DotA2,I just wanted to write about how impressed I've been by this tournament. Even as a European who has only been able to watch about half of the streams live I feel like I've seen about three EU hubs' worth of dank memes and quality Dota.   The chemistry of the panelists has been incredible. From Jack to Lacoste from Charlie to Grandgrant from the Salt Lord to the Swindlemelonzz celebrity phone-in special everyone's been great value. It's always a joy to see a more relaxed atmosphere in which people we know from so many  professional events hanging out.   And the skits - Jesus Christ. Hotbid everyone take a bow.   The whole thing just feels like a collection of incredibly smart passionate and talented individuals - not least the players - coming together to celebrate the game and the people who play it.   I guess you could also say that the Summits of past years have been the same. But in the context of the game's mooted decline much discussed on here lately and BTS beginning to branch out into other newer e-sports scenes it seems all the more poignant.   For what it's worth I've always felt like reports of the death of Dota 2 have been greatly exaggerated. I'm surprised by the strength of opinions that seem to run hot on this subreddit. It seems like every other thread has a string of upvoted posts declaring Valve a greedy and lazy developer uninterested in the game beyond its ability to render them profit.    Conversely in every *other* other thread the prevailing opinion will be that they're the best custodian Dota could have hoped for in contrast to companies such as Blizzard and Riot who would have been *even more* greedy lazy and profit-obsessed.    Surely the answer lies somewhere in the middle. Valve have done a lot of good things for the game. They've carried it a long way. In the pub scene Dota is still a joy to play. Even after 6.88 widely hailed at the time as the best that game's ever been improvements have been made. Shrines backpacks talents and even Monkey King have all added something new and exciting to the mix even if it took a while to get them to a place where they were considered strictly enhancements.   In the professional scene people who accuse Valve of smothering the scene with too many majors and an over-reliance a small number of production companies are quick to forget the dire days of the Shanghai major. In a lot of ways that choice was made for Valve by the failures of Perfect World to hold up their end of the 'CS:GO model'.   But it's clear they've made some mistakes along the way. When we moved from the old client to Reborn quite a lot of features fell by the wayside. Third party compendiums crowd-funded prize pools and creator-friendly workshop policies are just some of the problems that Valve seem to have pushed to one side and forgotten about.    I imagine that because freelancers and third party orgs aren't strolling into Volvo headquarters in Bellevue every weekday their problems don't seem as immediate to Valve employees as the things they talk to each other about. But that doesn't mean those problems can be safely ignored.   I'm neither smart nor clued-in enough to know all the ins-and-outs of what's going on. But third parties have clearly been alienated by some of the decisions Valve have made and the breakdown in communication that has followed.   Yet in spite of this BTS go ahead and put together what for my money at least is one of the greatest events in the history of professional Dota.   I guess I'm writing this because I desperately want Valve to wake up and realise the value that these people are contributing to the scene surrounding the game - and how much they deserve to be rewarded and encouraged to continue.    Workshop artists casters broadcasters observers tournament organisers hell even Slacks - beyond the core of the game which is obviously fundamental it's the people around it and the work that they do that grows a scene and sustains it.    It's almost like Valve has the perfect gf/bf: supportive dedicated funny... but because they're so damn busy all the time they've lost sight of what's important and how much they're getting out of the relationship. I'm not sure they realise how damaging it would be to let all this slip through their hands.   Or maybe this is all way off. It's late I've had three glasses of wine and the heat is making it feel like six. All I know is that I've never felt about a game quite the way I feel about Dota and watching this tournament makes me feel like there's a group of incredibly awesome people who feel the same way. Valve shouldn't take that for granted.  TL;DR: Kappa Keepo 123,shoutout

The Bucharest Major at its end - A thank you to the community,self.DotA2,Hello everybody  While we are still loading up the production PCs and rolling up cables like the aspiring pros we are we wanted to take a moment to thank the community the talent the teams and everybody else involved that helped make The Bucharest Major come to life.   For this event our first Major since the inception of the DPC we wanted to go back to the basics. The focus of the event would be on starting the matches on time and moving seamlessly through the different series. While this may mean we had to make some compromises the results speak for themselves.   The Bucharest Major wasnt perfect by any means. There are lots of things we still need to work on but the fact that we had almost NO technical pauses for the entire event and that we finished ahead of schedule rather than behind it on most days gives us a sense of accomplishment.   We did try some new things. For a substantial part of our crew this was their first esports tournament. And we believe all things considered they performed exceptionally.   We worked with new talent that had never crossed our studios carpeted no-shoes-allowed floors. It is in part because we were so impressed with their skill and professionalism that we wanted the BO5 finale to include all of them.   Thank you to the new friends we made and the original friends that always had our back. Heres looking at you Redeye. And thank you to the friends that made us laugh but did so in a professional manner while the cameras were rolling. I mean of course Slacks and Maly.   We are also grateful to our friends at Imba for not only being our co-organizers but also for transmitting our work to an audience that is hungry for quality games and quality production. We cant forget how much help we received from partners and sponsors Twitch Telekom Romania HyperX Red Bull SecretLab and Omen by HP.  And of course thank you to the teams who trusted us to uphold a certain standard of competition and hospitality. We hope we didnt disappoint.   Lastly thank you to the Dota community. While you may be a diverse outspoken bunch we know that whatever comes out of your mouths and keyboards is first spurned by a love of the game and not maliciousness of spirit. We hope our Bucharest Major helped you love Dota a tiny bit more than you did before it.   That is or should be the real objective of any organizer.

Dear Artour B.,self.DotA2,Hey man what an outstanding performance this TI. Arguably a top performer throughout the group stages and one game that was hard fought. Despite all the criticisum you've received and will yet to you are still an inspiration not to hundreds or thousands but hundreds of thousands. Such myself an older (28) and later comer to Dota(2) and the competive scene.   Like many greats winning did not come easy. It takes failing to be a champion and many can tell you the failure can only fuel the fire. Your time will come and i'm sure of it as long as you continue to keep your head up. You inspire many such as myself to continually learn the game and enjoy its entirety.   Your streams were great too not only from your playmaking but from the music and vibe as well as I enjoy the same genre. Hope you get back on again some day. If youre ever back in the IE (BTS) hit me up! Drinks on me.  Whatever you choose to do please continue to inspire the many people you do and chase your dreams. Wherever you are i'll always root for you to bring it all home one day. Best of luck to you and your future endeavors.   ,shoutout

EPICENTER XL: you did it Reddit!,self.DotA2,It's probably a bit late for this as you've already covered each and every aspect of the event we've just hosted. Nevertheless I still want to say a few words.  This has been by far the most difficult event in my esports life. We faced all possible kind of issues along those insane 10 days and I am extremaly grateful to all the teams and all the talents for their patience and understanding.   Paul has taught us a lot about the small production bits that help make the show more enjoyable to watch. Kyle proved himself as a great panelist. Cap rocked it in his shorts while barely able to walk. Bulldog turned out to be not just a meme master but a Major Finals caster able to work in front of an almost 10k live audience speaking a completely different language. Grant and Breaky Pidgeon and Bkop Nomad and Mofarah they all brought something new to the Major scene (oh my word) and I really wish we will see them more in the next season. GoDz and ODPixel who seem to be around since forever yet never cease to amaze us. I salute all of you gentlemen!  This year we've tried to do the things differently and not all of them worked the way we expected. And our team is grateful for all the feedback you provided. It will help us improve our next events and make them even more EPIC! Tank you all!,shoutout

A thank you letter to the community from the guy that made the Sven & Dazzle comic,self.DotA2,Hi people I'm the dude that made the [Sven and Dazzle](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6fmkg6/experienced_player_gives_helpful_advice_to/?st=j3o7y02a&sh=ef8eab44) comic.   I just want to thank you all for the reception. I've been making comics for a short while but oh my god were you guys nice. Seriously it was amazing. You made me feel like a super star. You made that simple comic the 4th highest post in r/dota2!   I got so many replies and PMs. I took allot of time to answer as much as I could at least upvote every single comment. You people really like to present yourselves as a pure salt mine but that wasn't my experience.   The number of compliments and nice things you said was insane. I was sure to keep making comics but now I'm more pumped than ever.   I just wanna thank you for everything to everyone that commented and the silent majority for enjoying my content and telling me to do more.   You made such a commotion that I even got to talk to the creator of Extra Fabulous Comics (my fav. webcomic artist)!   You're all 6k in my eyes.   Cheers  PS I want this to be a pure thank you letter but there's an update on my stuff in the comments since I know people have been asking about it   PPS I'm 2k trash ,shoutout

Dota's Lore in a Nutshell,self.DotA2,So a super long time ago Elder Titan made EG.Universe and everything came into existence.  It was super chill because all of the forces of the universe existed together as one being that sort of composed everything.  Then one of the four fundamental forces decided to be a total asshole and split everything up.  This was KotL KotL is actually the ultimate evil and bad guy of the Dota EG.Universe.  The Fundamentals got split up into four different beings.  First was KotL who decided to celebrate his freedom by going on a rampage and slaughtering Night Stalker's people.  He also is a huge pervert but gets away with it by pretending to be an alzheimers patient.  Chaos Knight was another Fundamental who dedicated his life to chasing down the batshit crazy KotL; yeah CK is actually the good guy trying to track down the insane madman.  Enigma was another Fundamental who decided to start fucking with people and grow in power while the last Fundamental Wisp just sorta wandered off one day.  Meanwhile a bunch of vague shit happened and our world was made by Earthshaker.  How did he do it?  Nobody knows except for ET and he's out of the meta so nobody is gonna ask him anyway.  Even Earthshaker doesn't really remember how it worked.  Tiny was born when the world was made he was a little pebble who just sorta rolled around on the ground slowly growing up.  The world existed in peace and harmony except not really because a lot of crazy unimportant shit happened like Lycan's dad getting shanked and Axe going hard as a motherfucker on literally everything.  Then shit got crazy and the Moon split in half.  Yeah apparently there were two Gods or something living in the moon?  Or something?  They didn't like eachother and fought endlessly  I dunno but the moon kinda exploded and all the pieces of the moon fell onto the planet.  The two gods or whatever were the ancients one that was Dire and one that was Radiant.  When the pieces all fell to earth they became the Ancients that people defend.  Getting too close to one of the shards makes you go bananas and convince yourself that you're in an endless war just like the two gods in the moon were and you turn into a creep.  Slark snatched a magic chalice from under Naga's nose and Naga got exiled because of it while Kunkka got the Gem of True Sight from the evil Kraken god Maelrawn.  Kunkka ran away but Maelrawn sent Tidehunter after the Kunk-ster and Tidehunter blew up his ship.  Kunkka is probably a ghost now but who fucking knows anyway the two are at eachother's throats forever now.  Rubick and Invoker knew eachother or maybe not but Rubick knew OF Invoker or something.  Invoker used to be called the Arsenal Magus and everyone thought he was top shit so a bunch of cultists did some selective breeding eugenics to try and make another Invoker only they ended up making Silencer instead who told them to shut the fuck up.  Invoker also knew Undying back when he was alive but Undying is now a zombie who serves the Dead God which sent its army to kill all of Antimage's people.  Antimage somehow blamed this on magic instead of zombies even though Antimage is the biggest hypocrite in all of Dota since he uses fucking Blink as his main tool.  Some Goddess somewhere named Nyctasha had a really fucking bad dream about Faceless Void and it came to life as Bane and killed her Outworld Devourer came to earth to warn us about some REALLY BAD SHIT that's coming from outside the galaxy but nobody seems to listen Tusk and Bristleback had fisticuffs in a bar and a bunch of other wacky shit took place.  Now people are basically fighting eachother because they were driven crazy by the ancients and transformed into creep armies to try and kill eachother while the heroes are just people who have enough Purity of Will to not go batshit crazy.  But none of this fucking matters because it's a videogame.  And no I'm not saying that to be a smartass.  It's literally a videogame.  The Dota universe takes place in a computer program with the inhabitants unaware that they're just programs.  The only one who knows is Leshrac who figured it out by peering into the heart of creation and discovering that everything he's doing is nothing more than participating in a game called Defense of the Ancients.  And it really really really makes him sad.,shoutout

Thanks for the early patch release,self.DotA2,"Hey valve   I tried sending you an email not sure if it went to the right place so here is a message about your early release of the new patch.   To a lot of people releasing a patch one day or even an hour early is just a nice thing that makes their day slightly better and gets them off the edge of their toilet and back into their gaming computer for a fun night. For me this patch release was different. My mother suffered an aneurysm into a stage 5 bleed on October 30th. She hung on until about 8AM on October 31st after I spent the whole night with my family literally watching her die.   Still in shock I finally got home and crashed after being the last bastion of wakefulness my family had keeping things organized and held down so when they woke up she would be peacefully breathing and they would be somewhat rested.   When I finally got to my computer to sit down and chat with my best friend who refused to play dota til the new patch came out I said ""please play some dota with me. I need to take an emotional and mental break from this. I don't give a shit new patch or not lets just play."" So I opened up my Dota client and while I was gone it had downloaded and installed the patch. I was shocked to see two new heroes to play and some neat new items to fiddle with (I had read the patch notes before so I kinda new they were coming just not that day.)  It didn't fill the void I now have it didn't stop the crying but what it did do is give me a very pleasant surprise one day early and on the day I watched my mother pass away to distract me for a few hours. I know most people probably won't care and I don't really care if you upvote or don't I just want someone at valve to know that them releasing the patch one day early made a positive impact in someones life no matter how small in the grand scheme of that day it was.   Thanks. ",shoutout

Can we all really appreciate Icefrog and Valve for the current patch?,self.DotA2,I personally found TI5 matches really boring due to the small hero pool in the meta and the farming heavy strategies.  This patch has been incredible. We've seen everything from 5 man deathball to 10 man team wipes thrilling base races unbelievable comebacks slippery rat strategies tense extended roshan fights huge number of viable heroes in the meta more blood shed in a match than the entirety of game of thrones--sometimes with whole team fights starting and ending before the creeps have spawned matches that flip back and forth throughout games that showcase and reward both individual skill and teamwork--allowing both cores and supports to shine nail biting jukes and blink-and-you-miss-it surprise kills it has been wonderful to both watch and play dota.  Dota will keep changing and getting better but right now we're in a super sweet spot and I couldn't be more excited for TI6.  We give you a lot of crap Volvo but we really do love what you've done with this game. Sometimes it's difficult to hear the lone voice of praise amidst the Tsunami of criticism but I hope you see this and know that all of us really appreciate your passion and dedication to Dota and to us.,shoutout
Can we have Moonduck organizing more tournaments/events?,self.DotA2,First Midas Mode and now CD 4.0. Both have been fucking awesome! The light-heartedness of these tournaments make it really enjoyable to watch and I sincerely hope we get to see more from them.,shoutout
Midas Mode is exactly the type of show I hoped to see when Moonduck announced founding of the studio,self.DotA2,"When the announcement came in 2015 I couldn't have been more excited about who is involved in Moonduck and what their ""mission statement"" as a studio was. Then when they announced Midas Mode earlier this year I thought ""yes! finally this is it!"" and I'm glad to see I was right.  While Elimination Mode was really fun to watch and a (very clear) glimpse into what the studio is about Midas Mode just knocks it out of the park. The idea and realisation of the game mode aside everything else around it has been absolutely on point as well. The people the dynamics between them and the overall vibe coming out of that. Even the ""we barely know what we're doing but let's go!"" approach to production.  The whole thing is just oozing charm and genuine personality. I love it. (also Trent has become my favourite dota-Canadian next to Arteezy)  It's so awesome to see the result of Moonduck's hard work over the last two years. And with Captain's Draft becoming an actual LAN (and Minor) in its fourth iteration I can't wait to see what's next for them.",shoutout
SyndereN really is the perfect english dota caster,self.DotA2,"He has a good english voice he can play-by-play he's super knowledgeble in analysis he not biased to any teams he never trashtalks or says stuff like ""this draft is so bad i dont know how team x is gonna win"" minute 1 he always takes it as both teams are not bad and really are trying to play/draft their best.  He says that he still wants to try play competitive but imo he is THE BEST caster of the scene and I think the community would miss him dearly if he stopped casting for some time.  He reminds me a lot about Anders from CS:GO who is also danish.   God this country is producing good english casters.",shoutout

We got it.  * We wanted parties of 5 to be able to select captain in ranked captains mode. We got it.  * We wanted bans in ranked all pick. We got it.  * Many bugs that have popped up over the course of the last few weeks such as CM aura not working. Fixed(mostly).

MiSeRy appreciation thread,self.DotA2,This guy was flamed to be the weakest link in Secret during Shanghai major. At some point I agreed. However as he gets comfortable in the offlane role he became a beast and instrumental in Secret's run at Shanghai. Right after winning he was kicked together with w33ha. w33ha received more sentiments from the community and MiSeRy was just left hanging around.

(*It sparked some top notch memes though!*)  This time around however Mercedes listened to the criticism and created something more fitting which I admire.   Although no one likes advertisement it's a vital part of any entertainment business today and the E-sports scene needs big sponsors to keep growing.   _Therefore I want to thank Mercedes for taking E-sports seriously!_  **link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5Z4doe1x2g**",shoutout

Something I've always appreciated about Blitz's casting.,self.DotA2,"When something bad happens to a team Blitz always finds a way to describe it without criticizing players too much.  If someone misses a skill shot Blitz will say ""Kunkka guesses wrong on the torrent"" where other casters might just say ""Kunkka misses the torrent"".  It's minor but when these add up it helps make Blitz seem more impartial and more respectful.  So thanks Blitz and Synd (who is also good about this) it's refreshing to hear.",shoutout
Props to Sonneiko only 8k+ on leaderboards that only picks supports.,self.DotA2,Went through all the dotabuff pages of people 8K+ Sonnieko seemed to be the only one that picks support only would be awesome if we could convince him to stream.

Can we take a moment an honour the production team that there are no boring breaks and flawless transitions?,self.DotA2,"TI5 was the only one I didn't watch so I don't know how it went last year. But let's be honest. When was the last time we saw a huge tournament that goes serveral days and has no boring downtimes breaks commercials graphical placeholders that say ""Upcoming match X vs Y in 30 minutes"" with a looping melody in the background and so on.   And the variety in presentation each day. Muppets commenting from outside Kaci of course (she's awesome as every year). AR stuff. A draft panel a pre/after match panel commentators Purge MrActionsSwags.  That is some high level production right there compared to other big esport tournaments. They don't even need to raise the bar next year. Just do the same stuff and I will still be amazed.",shoutout

A message to Bulldog and his plebs.,self.DotA2,I am just a Scottish boy that enjoys playing the Dotes and sticks on a stream from time to time for little to no viewers. Last Friday when Bulldog ended his stream he decided to host me.  My channel was held captive by his plebs! I had a great time and there was some good laughs.

Official announcement from the teams of Midas Mode,self.DotA2,We the participating Midas Mode organizations and players of Evil Geniuses Immortals Mid or Feed Na`Vi OG OpTic Gaming Team Liquid and VGJ.Storm have come together this holiday season to take a stand against the tyrannical Grinch going by the name SirActionSlacks. We reject his philosophy of greed we reject his corrupting mentality of more and we most definitely reject his lackluster memes! So we are hijacking his tournament for good.  [In all seriousness we want to thank Slacks and MoonduckTV for being so willing and excited to help us hijack their tournament and its meaning for a bunch of good causes.]  In the spirit of the holidays the players of all eight teams have pledged to donate all of their prize winnings from Midas Mode to a charity of their teams choice listed below.  We believe that giving back to our communities is a responsibility we all share in life and we are inspired by other gaming communities who have long been supporting charity and uplifting others. Having the bright lights of Dota upon us the time is long overdue that we as a Dota community come together to set an example. Gamers can be a positive force in our communities and this is one small step in the right direction.  We ask that all of our fans join with us and support these and many other great causes this holiday season. Please donate a bit of whatever you have to give to help lift someone else up: money time canned goods or a beloved game gathering dust because you spend twelve hours a day grinding for badges now!

ESL: We were wrong.,self.DotA2,I`ll get straight to the TL;DR here (and then add more details and context after it):  Over the last few days we were wrong in how we acted in multiple instances and this post is to apologize to you fans of esports and community streamers affected.   We were wrong in how we kicked off streaming on Facebook and we were wrong in handling the follow-up with the community the communication here and the DMCAs which we have since retracted.  The introduction of Facebook as our new broadcast platform did not go as it should have. Instead of focusing on ironing out the kinks engaging in the right kind of dialogue with you and incorporating your legitimate feedback we were busy following protocol and defending our actions. We should have simply let the community streamers do their thing while focusing on getting our end right. Regardless of having or not having the right to do so taking down streamers that provide a good experience while we arent is not the way to go about things.  We were in the wrong. We will learn from it and go forward.  Now Im not going to try to defend it but since the platform and streaming of the game is a topic which will resurface I`ll try and add some details and context which are important to consider for the broader picture:  ESLs goal is to elevate esports. Its been that way for the past 18 years and many of the same people that started the company in 2000 are still the same ones working behind the scenes at ESL today. Were not in it for short-term profits but want to help build an industry. Helping to create esports is not only the core of our efforts it is all we do. Our mission is to give players and teams a platform to create big moments that you enjoy talk about and remember.   Expanding the amount of streaming platforms which show and promote esports and building an environment where platforms compete to show esports is part of that process. Working with companies that can help us bring esports to the mainstream is part of that process. Yet if the things we do come at the expense of our relationship with the audience we need to critically re-evaluate our approach.   We acknowledge our mistakes and we apologize.  What we got wrong last week we want to get right for the rest of the year.  That means learning from what happened working with Facebook on improving the experience as well as changing the way we talk with you.  All things considered thank you for watching ESL One Genting whichever platform you did it on. I'll be here to continue collecting feedback as I have been for the last couple of days and trying to continue the dialogue. ,news

Dota 2 Reborn - The Beta Begins,dota2.com,,news
So The Workshop tools isn't just a modding platform. It's Source 2. And it's running Dota 2.,self.DotA2,Everything in this package is a new game.  It's all the Dota assets and code ported over to Source 2.  That's why Hammer is different.  That's why the console is different.   Guys.  Valve just soft launched the entire Source 2 engine.    EDIT: Because people are asking for proof.  Everything that would share a name with Source is named '...2'.  That's 'engine2.dll' 'vconsole2.exe' 'vphysics2.dll'.  When you go to open a map in Hammer it asks for .vmap files.  One of the other options is '.vmf (Source 1.0)' files.  [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/HElcsOu.png) (thanks /u/darkmio)  The fucking console is redone.    There is a new Key-Value like format (~~that i'm gonna call KV2~~).  It is type safe.  It looks like this: http://pastebin.com/RVQtkv1j.  EDIT: Looks like my name isn't going to stick.  The engine calls them 'Schema Files' written by CSchemaTextWriter. (Voided found this)   EDIT2 (Probably the strongest evidence): That script also allows for different dlls to load and render different assets (vmaps are rendered by worldrenderer.dll etc).  This is quite a bit different from Source 1 as they had a large number of things in the engine libraries.  This bit alone would indicate a significant amount of engine work has been done to split these bits out of the engine and into their own libraries.    ^^EDIT: ^^hey ^^RPS ^^i ^^changed ^^this ^^paragraph ^^so ^^you ^^guys ^^should ^^probably ^^use ^^the ^^updated ^^paragraph ^^as ^^it's ^^more ^^correct.       EDIT3: ~~lol source2 apparently support fax machines.  (VoiDeD found this) (source: http://privatepaste.com/513891c5dc )~~ Looks like the Tiff Library  EDIT4: from /u/nellody: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/w/images/3/35/Tileset_new_outliner.png notice the 'source2' in the path.    EDIT: the general consensus around the source reverse engineering community is that this is really source 2.    EDIT: hi neogaf.   EDIT:       3:01:56 AM <@VoiDeD> there's l4d3 crap all over the vscript code  EDIT: 'CSource2EntitySystem' is a class name.  (thanks Netshroud),news

Lets now stop speculating...Wait for EU shuffle... #dota2""    **4\.** [Charlie officially confirms.](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sn8s65) -           Rather than have people speculate or message players for answers I'm going to go ahead and announce the new EG Dota 2 roster: Sumail Universe Fear PPD and Arteezy.                   Yes Kurtis was removed from the roster. The rest of the players decided that the above roster was what they wanted to go forward with.                   Personally I'm deeply affected by this and I'm very sad to see Kurtis go. I've known him the longest out of anyone on the team. He was the one that originally asked me to be the manager for Potm Bottom years ago and I cannot state enough how depressed I am to see him go. I cannot imagine how much worse he feels.                  Professionally I trust the judgment of the captain and the other players. I will not make roster decisions on their behalf and I will not force players to play on rosters they don't want to play on. EG is deeply grateful to Kurtis for what he has helped contribute and will continue to support him in whatever he decides to do and wherever he decides to go. I say this both for myself and on behalf of the organization.                  -Charlie Yang  #[](/pennant-secret) RTZ Kuroky and Team Secret * [Day 1 Stream Transcript by /u/Clasp](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3h26ir/transcript_of_arteezy_comments_from_stream/) * [Day 2 Stream Transcript by /u/Clasp](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3h5fll/arteezys_from_stream_day_2_comments_about_kuroky/) * About Team Secret's problems - ""Everyone had fucking egos.

Stretch Goal #13 Unlocked: Prize Pool is now $6 Million. Well Played!,self.DotA2,Every goal struck out in just over 10 days. Insane! We can rage at each other as much as we want in-game but as a community we are so damn strong and I loved every moment of being a part of it for nearly a decade now.  The big question - are we done yet though? :)  P.s: Buildings hats. Best hats.  ---  **For the non-Dota 2 folk from the Frontpage** | - via /u/suttin  For those of you coming from the front page Valve hosts a yearly tournament for Dota 2. They sell an in game item called The Compendium [all you need to know found here](http://www.dota2.com/international/compendium/).  Whats so crazy about this is that 25% of Compendium related purchases go to the prize pool. Valve seeded the prize pool with $1.6 million. The community has raised it another $4.4 million* to a total of $6 million.   We have already doubled the biggest ever video game tournament prize pool set by last years International and if the prize pool is split the same way as last year the first place team will take home $3 million split 5 ways across the team.  **Related Links**  - [Tournament Information](http://www.dota2.com/international/announcement/) - [Liquipedia](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/The_International/2014) - as of right now it's not all the way filled out because qualifiers are still happening - [Prize pool tracker](http://dota2.cyborgmatt.com/prizetracker/international2014) - At the bottom it compares last years to this years prize pool Distribution is not confirmed yet.   **How To Watch?**  The Qualifiers for the tournament are currently going on and you can watch it for free.

Dota 2 Beta is now OVER!,store.steampowered.com,,news
May 31 2017 Update,self.DotA2,###Matchmaking Changes  * As an experimental change for a few days All Pick will now have **25 heroes randomly removed from the hero pool at the start** of the draft before the ban phase. *This change only affects Ranked Matchmaking*.   ---  ###Other Changes  * In today's update we are changing how commands are processed in Dota to address some user input contention and improve responsiveness. Previously if you cast a spell and before it finished casting you cast two spells afterwards only the last spell would be cast. The order queue was only 1 deep effectively. This usually has no practical impact except for things with really fast/instant cast time done in sequence. Here are a few examples of how the behavior would be different:  **Example 1:**  Axe casts battle hunger. While the cast animation is playing Axe quickly uses a Blink Dagger and then Berserker's Call.  - Old Rules: Only Berserker's Call is cast. The blink dagger order is ignored. - New Rules: Axe will use the Blink Dagger then cast Berserker's Call.   **Example 2:**  Puck casts Illusory Orb. Puck then casts Dream Coil. While the cast animation of Dream Coil is playing Puck quickly casts Ethereal Jaunt and Waning Rift.  - Old Rules: Only Waning Rift would have triggered and Puck would not have teleported with Ethereal Jaunt. - New Rules: Puck teleports with Ethereal Jaunt and then casts Waning Rift in the new location.   This change applies generally to all orders that are issued when your hero is in another action (like during a cast animation or while stunned) and the order needs to enter the queue. Issuing a movement command or stop will still empty the queue same as before if you decide you no longer want to issue the orders in the queue.,news
Dota 7.11,self.DotA2,7.11: ==  * This version is focused on changing how the gold and buyback formulas work.  * Buyback cost changed from 100 + ( Level * Level * 1.5) + (Time * 0.25) to 100 + Networth / 13 * Buyback no longer reduces gold earned after respawning  * AoE gold for the losing team no longer scales with the overall team networth difference just the individual networth of the dying hero. Previously a core on your team doing really well meant that a support on your team dying gave an increasing amount of gold to the enemy.   - The comeback component is now just: ( DyingHeroNetWorth * 0.026 + 70 ) / # of killers      This takes the place of the components below that considers Networth      For example in the 1 killer case it replaces (NetWorthEarlyFactor * 90 + NetWorthFactor * 0.03375).      Like the previous formula it is only given to the losing team.  * The gold multiplier based on the dying hero's net worth rank changed from 1.2/1.1/1.0/0.9/0.8 to 1.2/1.05/0.9/0.75/0.6  ---  For reference the previous AoE gold formula is listed below:  **Terms:**      NetWorthDifference = ( EnemyTeamNetWorth / AlliedTeamNetWorth ) - 1 [With a min of zero and a max of 1]          NetWorthFactor = NetWorthDifference * VictimNetWorth          NetWorthEarlyFactor (for when Enemy has more NW) = ( EnemyTeamNetWorth - AlliedTeamNetWorth ) / 4000 [Has a max of 1]          NetWorthPoorFactor = 1.3 - 0.1 * NetWorthRank (dying's hero's networth rank)          NetWorthRankingFactor (hero's rank amongst allies involved in the kill): For 1/2/3/4/5 from poorest to richest are: { 1 } / { 1.25 0.75 } / { 1.25 1.0 0.75 } / { 1.25 1.08 0.916 0.75 } / { 1.25 1.125 1.0 0.875 0.75}  **Formula:**      1 Killer: NetWorthPoorFactor * NetWorthRankingFactor * ( 126 + 4.5 * VictimLevel + NetWorthEarlyFactor * 90 + NetWorthFactor * 0.03375 )          2 Killer: NetWorthPoorFactor * NetWorthRankingFactor * ( 63 + 3.6 * VictimLevel + NetWorthEarlyFactor * 67.5 + NetWorthFactor * 0.03375 )          3 Killer: NetWorthPoorFactor * NetWorthRankingFactor * ( 31.5 + 2.7 * VictimLevel + NetWorthEarlyFactor * 45 + NetWorthFactor * 0.03375 )          4 Killer: NetWorthPoorFactor * NetWorthRankingFactor * ( 22.5 + 1.8 * VictimLevel + NetWorthEarlyFactor * 31.5 + NetWorthFactor * 0.027 )          5 Killer: NetWorthPoorFactor * NetWorthRankingFactor * ( 18 + 0.9 * VictimLevel + NetWorthEarlyFactor * 22.5 + NetWorthFactor * 0.02025 ),news

E-sport is going to be registered as official sport in Poland.,self.DotA2,"It looks like next country decided to do this. Poland can into the Major?  [Source](http://www.dota2tv.pl/threads/e-sport-w-polsce-oficjalnie-uznany-za-sport.1076/)  Translation :  It seems that in our country soon we will speak without hesitation that e-sport is registered as an official sport. All thanks to the amendment to the Act made by the Ministry of Sport and Tourism which changes the broad importance of sport.   A few months earlier a similar law adopted Russia so that it is possible to obtain the official title of ""Champion of Russia"" or ""Honorary Champion of Russia."" Even before the decision was made by the Australian government. So all indications are that soon all over the world will be signed similar legislation. Someone could ask but why?   Well if the country to which you need to enter a visa athletes receive it almost immediately. As you know the scene Dota 2 always struggled with the problem of visas the best example is the Execration which therefore had to give up slots at major Boston. Therefore the more countries recognize e-sport for the sport the better it is for professional players  Many people both older and younger think that eSports has no right to be considered as a sport because it is ""simply clicking the mouse."" Supporters of the recognition of electronic games as a sport also have a pair of arguments but the argument on the forums and in comments is not extinguished. Let us hope that this law will change.  Full text of the new law is not yet known but to expand the concept of ""sport"" in Article 2 of the Act 1 learned from the Bulletin of the Public Information Office of the Prime Minister. It was announced there include ""extending the definition of sport which from now on would also include mental activity whose aim is to improve the overall efficiency of intellectual property including cause-and-effect thinking and concentration."" Currently the passage in question of the Act is as follows:  > ""Sport is all forms of physical activity which through casual or organized participation affect or improving physical fitness and mental social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels.""

Matchmaking bans are being issued against these types of players.   ---  ###Economy Updates  **Treasure of the Emerald Revival - UNRELEASED**  - Store banner strings have been added for this treasure.

Official Punishment - regarding uG vs Ehug,self.DotA2,"After deliberation we have reached a decision regarding the punishment of Union Gaming for unpausing in game 4 of the Grand Finals which resulted in first blood being spilled.  Our admins watched the replays from player perspectives each teams fog of war and of course also took the entire series into consideration as well.  We cannot prove that Union Gaming intentionally unpaused the game to gain advantage but we can see that it was beneficial for them to do so.  They say it was a misunderstanding maybe it was but even as a mistake this is unacceptable in the situation where it happened.  If a football player accidentally grabs the mask of another player in a game he will be penalized as if it was intentional we must penalize Union Gaming for their actions.  We did not have a rule in place at the time and our mod was not sure what to do so we decided to talk after with the counsel of more experienced community members and try to reach a fair punishment for the infraction an infraction which would fall under our ""Sportsmanship"" clause.    With all of this said the official punishment for Union Gaming will be a 25% monetary fine and no invitation to Season 3 of DOTA Regions.  This may feel heavy handed to some of you but to us we cannot tolerate even the suspicion of cheating.  To those of you who think we should have restarted the match immediately in hindsight this was probably the best option from here we can only go forward though.    The money that is being taken away from Union Gaming will not be kept by our organization.  Our entire goal is to stimulate our Semi-Pro scene and foster it's growth.  With this in mind we will be donating the 25% fines to Amateur Dota 2 League and NEL two leagues that we have alot of respect for and wish to see continued success in.  Rest assured that DOTA Regions cares deeply about this community that we will not tolerate abuses and that we will continue to learn and grow.  Our rule set will be much more thoroughly worked out next season.  Sorry to eHug for the problems.  Hope to see you guys in Season 3 until then GLHF!",news

Visual updates to Storm/Ember/Earth Spirit remnants can be applied to all wearable items and will properly mimic when Rubick steals them - Modified Storm Spirit's effects to bring them visually in line with other Spirits  **Coaching**  - Anyone in a matchmaking party can specify that they'd like to coach the party instead of play. In lobbies players can choose to coach a team instead of play or spectate. Coaches cannot be used in Team Matchmaking or Tournament lobbies. - Increased maximum matchmaking party size to 6 to allow a coach to teach an entire team of students (but you can't Find Match if you have 6 players with no coach) - Coaches are able to use in-player perspective views and broadcaster tools like line drawing to teach their students. They are able to ping on the ground the minimap and anywhere in the HUD itself. - Coaches are considered to be on the same team as their students so they cannot see anything in the game that their students can't see. - Coaches and students have private voice and text communication channels. - Coaches can hit their 'Hero Select' key to cycle through their students. - Coaches see spectator-style item purchase popups for their students. - In-perspective player view now shows the correct state of more HUD elements (Shop Quickbuy KDA/Last Hits/Denies Buyback). These improvements apply the the in-perspective view in live games and replays as well as coaches.  **ECONOMY**  **Steam Community Market**  - This update may greatly disrupt market prices. In order to prevent items being purchased at pre-update prices for arbitrage we are removing all item listings and returning them to their owners. While this removal process is taking place new items will not be able to be listed on the Steam Community Market. - You can now list an item on the market from the armory (right click: sell on the market). - Armory item tooltips now contain the current lowest trading price for an item of the same class as the one highlighted. (Class is a somewhat flexible concept at the moment so unusual courier prices will be less accurate than a specific wearable piece of equipment.)  **Crafting**  - Crafting recipes now have a chance of dropping as a bonus item. These drops do not take up your normal drops but are in addition to them.  - **Polymorph Recipes** - These recipes take a variable number of any input of the same rarity and output a random other item of the same rarity. Example: 2 of Any Rare => 1 Random Different Rare - **Augment Recipes** -These recipes take a combination of inputs of the same rarity and output a random other item of the next best rarity. Example: 1 of Any Common & 1 Wavecrester => 1 Random Uncommon - **Ancient Scroll Case** - A new type of Treasure Chest called the ""Ancient Scroll Case"" has been added. These cases drop multiple recipes when they are opened. - The Ancient Scroll Case has a chance to drop an Exceptional Recipe. These make items that were previously only available as Genuine quality promotional items. The recipe creates a non-genuine version of the item.  **Gems & Sockets**  - Items can now have up to 5 sockets. - A socket can receive a gem. Each socket can only contain one gem. - Some sockets require specific types of gems. - When a gem is added to a socket that already contains a gem the previous gem is destroyed. -  **New Socketing Tools:** - Artificer's Chisel: Adds a socket to an item. - Artificer's Hammer: Extracts the gems from an item. -  **Gem Types:** - *Kinetic Gems* - Adds a new animation to the hero using the item. - *Inscribed Gems* - Adds stat tracking ability to the item similar to the old strange system. - The item they are added to changes to the ""Inscribed"" quality. - *Ethereal Gems* - Adds a particle effect to the item. - All unusual effects can now be colorized. - *Prismatic Gems* - Colorizes the particle effect on the effect gem. - *Ascendant Gems* - The Ascendant Orb Gem of Taegeuk and Bloodstones are now Ascendant Gems. - The item they are added to changes to the ""Ascendant"" quality. (in addition to tracking victories or gifts given as they did before). - **Autograph Runes** - Autographs are now Autograph Runes. - Allows you to tag an item with a pro player's autograph. - Since an item can have 5 sockets you can now get a whole team to autograph an item. - The item they are added to changes to the ""Autographed"" quality. - **Spectator Gems** - Items that previously tracked 'games viewed' now contain spectator gems. - Spectator gems follow a specific league or team. - Styles that previously required 'games viewed' now require a gem with the same number of games viewed (for the correct league / player / team / etc). - Ethereal & Prismatic gems are used together on unusual items (couriers). - More types of gems will be coming in the future. - Unusual items do not change quality when gems are added. Non-unusual items will change in the order gems are added.  **Item Quality Keywords**  - The item quality keyword ""Vintage"" has been changed to ""Elder"". - The item quality keyword ""Tournament"" has been changed to ""Heroic"". - The item quality keyword ""Haunted"" has been changed to ""Cursed"". - The item quality keyword ""Strange"" has been changed to ""Inscribed"".  **Strange Items**  - Strange modifiers on items have been converted into stat tracking Inscribed Gems. - The stats on items are no longer wiped when an item is traded. - Strange modifiers that haven't been applied have been turned into 'gem packs' that grant a living stat tracking gem and a Artificer's Chisel to create a socket on an item. - Previously strange quality items are now have the inscribed quality.  **Unusual Paint & Colors**  - Unusual paint items have been changed into Gem Packs that will grant a gem of the same color of the old paint item when used. - All couriers that were painted in the past will now have color gems already installed of the appropriate color. - All legacy courier colors (very old drop colors bugged colors etc) have been preserved as color gems. If you want you can smash the courier to recover the legacy color gem and use it on some other courier or effect combination. - All unusual paint items on the Steam Community Market have been delisted. You can relist the Color Gem Packs. - All non-legacy colors (colors that drop normally from Treasure Chests) now have specific names (i.e.: ""Verdant Green""). Legacy colors will have the name ""Legacy (R G B)"". (Most Legacy Colors are completely unique but there are a few where more than one of that color exist.) - New colors will appear on Treasure Chest unusuals from time to time moving forward. - While we will avoid selecting legacy colors we cannot completely guarantee that new colors will not sometimes be similar. The 800 or so unique legacy colors in existence cover a large amount of color space.  ----  **Patch Size:** 769.2 MB",news

Some kind ass words for all the the talent invited to the Majors,self.DotA2,Since the majors talent list was released yesterday literally all I see are people saying mean ass shit about who got invited and how much they hate them. So here is a counter list for all you lads who made the cut. I decided to use harsh language here so I don't sound too much like a pussy   **Tobi** this crazy piece of shit is the best fucking caster we have had since literally forever. At ti1 this moron was screaming shit and he is still yelling about big plays from small tourneys to the biggest tourneys we got with the same dedication and passion as when he started. Every time this fool goes to a event he vomits up some shit that's so hype we repeat it for months in our pub games until he gives us something else to say over and over a thousand times still thinking its funny. What a goddamned legend.   **Capitalist** Good god look at this anti mage looking son of a bitch. You ever heard someone that can hype as good as cap from the good ol US of A? Hell no. This crazy fool came out of goddamed no where and is one of the best hype casters around only second to goddamed tobi and he freaking casts with tobi all the time hype'n the unhypeable. This dude was born on the main stage and still rocks it at every big as multi million dollar event till this day and can cast for like 14 hours strait and still sound more excited than me on my fucking wedding day. Unlimited energy unlimited enthusiam and unlimited appeal what a psychopath.   **LD** Good god if you have ever seen some kickass famous dota 2 clip on NoobFromUA's channel it probably has this smirking dude screaming on it at the top of his lungs. The play alliance winning ti3 litterally every goddamed cornerstone of fucking excellence in dota 2 history has the expert castin of this man behind it. He made a fucking studio with some buddies and it ended up being one of the premire studios in dota history and he still is active in casting shit dispite running a freakin empire. There is just no stopping this wily fuck.   **OD PIXEL** welcome to the goddamed cinderella story of esports. This relativly unknown screaming british kid goes from 0 to hero in appoximatly 3and a half hours and is demanded by the community as a whole to go to the largest esports event in history and he nails the shit out of it. Works every day for like a year casting to a audience of litterally like 10 people and now he casts games in the goddamed millions. The most disgusting part is that he is so stupidly good at it. What a prince.   **synderen** ex pro freaking player turned caster turned analyst turned literally freaking everything. This meming peice of shit has done it all and still is beloved by the community as a whole to this very day. People litterally tune into shit just because he is there and boycott it when he isnt. He has a show on goddamed television about dota 2 and we are all sitting here trying to win 3k pubs while he gets 7k just playing randomly for fun what the fuck. YOu ever meet someone who does everything well no matter what it is well thats this rainman ass fool. Jesus.   **Blitz** chester the molester over here is one of the funniest people in the scene but is also one of the smartest. how does that shit happen? how do you get the best of both worlds? I couldnt tell you but when the lord looked down at dota he said we need some weird ass lovable example of perfection in dota and he created blitz mother fucking william lee and then he passed the fuck out form exhaustion.  **merlini** if he isnt making powerpoints about shit you never thought about hes casting games with teams you never heard of and telling you shit you never even considered. Melini is so goddamed good when people say smart things they just assume they are some kinda clone of merlini cause he says things that are so fucking thought provoking we cant accept that anyone else could ever be on his level. He has been invited to every event since ever and no one even bats a eye lash cause this machine of a human nails it every time its like he was just meant to be there what a champion.   **Purge** if your playing dota 2 right now its probably cause this wierdo taught you how to do it. He scans drafts like he works at TSA and despite being one of the most respected analysts in the world he is also one of the most appreciated casters and panelists cause he brings the knowledge and the fucking dryest humor in the business. This bastard has been teaching us all about dota 2 since it came out and he is still teaching us shit 5 freakin years later cause this dude never stops calculating hes a litteral goddamed dota 2 terminator you just cant beat a machine.   **Zyori** who would have thought this weird ass kid would become one of the best hosts and panalists we have in the freaking scene in the span of like a year. This bastard rose from being the butt of the joke to being one of the most respected panelists and hosts in the scene and it was all due to never putting up with the troll as shit the community gave him. Some people rise up past the hate and this legging wearing son of a bitch rose so high his dreads burned off and he became a god among panelists fuck this kid.   **Godz** the thing people in dota 2 wanted the most last year was to this this grown man dress up like a anthropomorphic female deer and he fucking did it. Caster extraordinare studio head and all around goof ass motherfucker Godz has been rocking the scene harder than any other australian in the world SORRY TOBI. The community keeps tryin to come up with fresh new memes about him but he just shruggs it off kicks casting ass and sleeps on a bed full of cash and drugs every night before he needs to fly to another event to class it up. Sproink on you Bonzer bitch.   **Draskyl** i dont even need to say anything about this bald bastard cause we all consider him to be our fucking Dad. Hugely sucessful streamer. Great caster. The voice of The International Analyst Desk. Daddy got it all.   **Winter** holy shit the community had a fucking heart attack about winter like he wasnt even invited to the event at all. I havent seen a shitstorm like this since Alpine Ursa and this bastard IS STILL GOING TO THE EVENT. So smart and freaking on point the people almost burned down /r/dota 2 because they didnt think he got the respect he deserves. Who needs to say shit when the entire freaking community has your back? Well not you winter you genius bastard next major if you arnt on the main stage 4 people are gonna get fired instantly. Shit!  **Pyrion Flax** the goddamed king maker himself. One of the most sucessful content creators for dota ever and the reason 90% of the people that dont give a shit about pro dota watch anything about pro dota. Funny british and as realatiable as a old college roomate you never knew you had this cheeky bastard has made dota 2 hilarious for like 4 years and still makes people smile just hearing whatever random stupid shit comes out of his mouth. He still isnt good at the game and he has been playing for longer than almost all of us and thats because he knows how to still have fun and that friends is the biggest mystery in all of dota 2 history god bless this insane English goose man.   **Redeye** i dunno what the hell this professional ass intelligent man is doing hosting esports cause he seems like he could host the fucking super bowl. Oh wait thats right he litterally fucking invented hosting esports events hes a goddamed living legend who still does shit to this very day and can tell you more about esports that you litterally could ever want to know. The best part is that instead of being a uptight self rightous prick about it he is a down to earth hilarious humble king who reeks professionalism and wit with every sentence that comes out of his english as hell mouth. Its not often you get to see a master at work and this old bastard is the master of all esports and he still workin.   **Maelk** this is litterally the only dude on the fucking planet that can like 2 MOBAS apparently. Dispite what the community thinks about him liking leauge of legends the sad fact of the matter is that he knows more about Dota 2 than the average troll asshole trying to flame him and could kick their ass both in game and out of it cause he has the body of a elite ripped assasin. This dude has been doing dota 2 events since before you even knew what dota 2 was and still goes to the big ass events to represent gaming as a whole. Next time you wanna be a elitist prick and say that dota is the only game in the world just know that Maelk has seen it all and he still brings more knowlege about the game your obsessed about than you ever will.   **Nahaz** this dude is a literal professor of dota 2 and is one of the most enthusiastic and intelligent people that has ever graced a analyst desk. Some people complain that he has too much passion and talks to much but guess what these are the same people that mute their entire teams in game cause they think they communicate too much cause talking and thinking makes them uncomfortable aka wierdo assholes. Anyone who dislikes someone for being smart and entusiastic is most likely neither of those things stupid. Some dont like him cause he intterupts people well guess what mabey if they didnt say stupid shit he wouldnt need to talk over their dumb-asses and put em in their place with a big goofy ass smile on his face. So dont be a sheep and jump on the hate train make your own decisions in life open your fucking ears and learn more about dota 2 then you ever thought you could. class is in session assholes   **Kotlguy** This crazy shithead used to dress up like a fucking wizard alone in his basement and now he is the most handsome man in dota 2 and has hosted the biggest fucking events in the esports world put that shit in your wizard pipe and smoke it. If you think you cant make it big look at this kid freaking out screaming his head off in his casts and think to yourself that he used to look like some kinda dollar store gandalf up your game kids and mabye you can own the entire goddamned scene like kotlguy  **Stats People/Observers** I dont know shit about stats but I know that kpoptosis and noxville are the smartest number crunching shut ins we have in this scene right now and can tell you the win loss rate of a hero you forgot existed off of their goddamed heads. Weppas and skrff are so good at observing half the people that watch pro dota dont even know observers fucking exist cause its smooth like a goddamed computer program and they think its automatic. Pimpmuckl is so good at back of house shit that fucking valve tries to steal his stuff not to mention he rocks the oberver game just as good as anyone else. Overall these back of house badasses do so much shit we dont even know what exactly they do but goddamit we know when they arnt around cause it sucks ass.   so there you go nice words for nice people be kind to each other and if someone you love didnt get invited go tweet a kind ass message to them and tell em to keep on truckin and if someone you love is on this list go tell em great fucking job you earned it champ   be kind to eachother you glorious shitposters im out,artwork

Edit: BSJ's twitter post https://twitter.com/BananaSlamJamma/status/956076067164446720  Edit 2: ESL's statement on the issue https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7skypn/on_streams_from_esl_genting/,discussion
Valve should plant a tree for every 1000000 trees we destroy in the community challenge!,self.DotA2,Since we're probably generating millions of Dollars for Valve anyway they should give something back to us (in form of Battle Pass / Compendium Rewards which they already are doing) and to our planet. And because Valve is promoting destroying our barky friends (not that stupid little dog you own I mean trees) they might aswell plant some.   The **average cost** of planting a tree (according to google) is ~$140.   **For five trees** however the average cost would be around **$270**. If we take that into account Valve could easily plant 20000 trees for mere $1080000.   I'm sure if you plan to plant (heh) that many trees *anywhere* you'll get an even better discount. So that's either more trees or less cost for Valve. In any case everyone wins.   Better image for Valve for slightly less money. Better image for Dota and its community. And we planted some trees.,discussion

Please Valve dont get on reddits hook. Stay with your decision at least for some time.,self.DotA2,"I created this post to show that not all of us here on Reddit agree that Valve should allow autoexec again.   I played dota for 4 years and never even opened the autoexec.cfg in that time. There is no need for that.  Some people are saying that macroses are not giving you advantage over people who dont use it but thats bullshit because you are able to do stuff that other people cant. And it is not you who is smart cause you know how to set up autoexec its a flaw of the game that allows you to be better at the game without actually doing anything.    Also the removing of autoexec can mean that the redesigned UI that was promised to us is in its final stages.   P.S. I think this post will be heavily downvoted but i dont care i just want to try break the ""bring back macroses"" circlejerk.  ",discussion

Are you wondering why this is at the top of reddit right now because you are not apart of the DOTA or eSports community? The tl;dr here is that Valve (half life team fortress steam valve) just let go a community favorite host/personality for their large DOTA 2 tournament ongoing in Shanghai.

Dota Plus analysis by an ex-F2P game product manager,self.DotA2,"I worked in F2P games for 6 years some as a community manager and some as a product manager. I wanted to share my perspective on Dota Plus because I love talking and thinking about this stuff even though I grew to hate exploitative F2P game monetization:  **Pricing and revenue strategy:**  (For purposes of this analysis I'm ignoring the economy of community market purchases or individual cosmetic purchases and just looking at Battle Pass monetization strategy)  F2P revenue is generally made up of a tiny number of heavy spenders (whales) a small number of medium spenders (dolphins) and a large number of light spenders (minnows). For many F2P games revenue from those few whales makes up the majority of revenue for a game.   For Dota a whale would be someone who maxed out every battle pass spending hundreds or thousands of dollars a year. A dolphin would probably be someone who bought every Battle Pass bought the level 75 TI pass and bought the Battle Pass Bundle but didn't spend money on levels otherwise. A minnow would be someone who buys one or two passes a year with no additional levels. Overall whales and dolphins are getting a great deal on Plus pricing while minnows are seeing a price increase. Sorry minnows but revenue from dolphins and whales is usually the vast majority of F2P revenue so designers are going to be targeting dolphins and whales instead of minnows when planning new features.  (EDIT: I made a quick and dirty google doc for people to play around with example numbers: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SHfVVzfDoMA7V1I4n_KkvM8rWUPcGqNUa0bjuanXapw/edit?usp=sharing  If you click File ""Make a copy"" you can edit the variables to roughly simulate in-game purchasing trends to see how much whales can have an impact on revenue.)  This can be exploitative though and relies on people with addiction problems or other mental issues. This is the root of the whole loot box controversy in games now. As a community manager who spoke to many whales in the games I worked on I can say for certain that many of them had some serious issues that caused their spending behavior. Watch South Park's ""Freemium Isn't Free"" everything related to F2P monetization in that episode is sadly very accurate.   (EDIT: For clarification I don't believe all whales have addiction problems or mental illnesses. But I do believe that most F2P monetization is created in a way that unfortunately exploits players with these problems. It's usually not a conscious effort on the part of the developer to say ""let's target gamblers anonymous members"" it's a byproduct of using only data to drive monetization methods and decisions and not caring to understand who is spending and why as long as the money is coming in.)  ~~Plus is *much* less exploitative because the most you can spend on it is $3.99 per month. No more posts about people with level 9000 Battle Passes who spent thousands to get them!~~  (EDIT: One thing I did not consider in this post is the TI prize pool and events. Valve has said Plus is the replacement for Major Battle Passes so I definitely expect the TI Pass to return this summer for the purposes of generating the prize pool for TI. This will undoubtedly include the typical exploitative gambling mechanics to get the most revenue and the biggest prize pool. The point that remains is that the direction Valve is taking this new monetization feature is definitely less exploitative than their previous efforts and most F2P games.)  One area to watch out for here is whether Valve will add the ability to purchase shards. Right now they can only be earned by completing objectives which is great for people with gambling issues or similar problems with controlling their spending.   ~~For the average player the Plus experience will also be improved by the removal of additional purchases. With Battle Passes Valve had a financial incentive to lock away the best rewards at high levels forcing those additional purchase options and advertisements on players.~~ (CORRECTION: Major Battle Passes did not allow level purchases) With Plus Valve has a financial incentive to make it as fun and useful for every subscriber.   This model is a lot easier to maintain too: it's easier to keep a current player happy with new heroes cosmetics and challenges rather than trying to get new players to start playing. And that leads to my next topic...  **What Plus Means for the Game's Lifecycle**  Dota isn't dead or dying let's get that out of the way. But it has peaked in popularity. F2P games tend to stick around for a long time after their peak unless they get completely killed by a new competitor or a sequel.  The typical F2P lifecycle is Acquisition Monetization and Retention in that order:  Acquisition occurs when the game has not peaked in popularity yet when growing the audience is the most effective way to increase revenue. In this phase the developer is focused on marketing the game to people who haven't played it and trying to get current players to convince their friends to join in. For Dota one example of this strategy was releasing and heavily marketing the Free to Play movie to get new players interested.  Monetization occurs when new player growth has slowed and increasing spending for the existing audience is the most effective way to increase revenue. If the average player spends $1 on the game and you can increase that average to $2 you just doubled your revenue. The TI Battle Pass is the most successful example of this strategy in action but you can look back and see Valve's experiments with other strategies like gems crafting and chests. These features did not appeal to new players they were only meant to get existing players to spend more money.  Retention occurs when more players are leaving the game than starting to play the game so the strategy changes to maintaining existing revenue rather than growing revenue. To do this developers are going to aim to keep current players as happy as possible while locking them in to consistent spending patterns sacrificing short-term revenue gains for long-term strategy.   So it should be clear now that Plus is Valve's strategy for the Retention phase of Dota's lifecycle. Rather than a new feature that gets whales to spend as much as possible in a short time like the TI Battle Pass Valve is avoiding high but exploitative whale revenue options for a more consistent and longer-term revenue scheme. Offering a discount for 6 month and 12 month subscriptions is part of this strategy: if you buy a 12 month subscription you're going to be less likely to quit over the next year because you are committed. If you are paying month to month and an interesting new game comes along you can avoid the negative feeling of financial loss easily by quitting after your current month is up.   Again do not interpret this as ""Dota is dying"". Retention is usually the longest phase of a game's lifecycle (unless it gets replaced by a sequel or killed by a superior competitor) and it can be the most fun and rewarding phase for many players. Instead of trying to maximize spending or new player growth their goal is to keep us happy and keep us playing.   The downside is that it's unlikely we will see any huge new features launched after this one. Rather than working on new features it's likely Valve will focus on improving Plus and supporting the most successful existing features such as new heroes and pro tournaments.  **TL:DR: In its current form Plus is a much less exploitative monetization feature than the TI Battle Pass and indicates that Valve's current direction with new monetization features is to provide the best experience for current players so they continue playing Dota for years to come.**  (EDIT: If you are interested in the P2W discussion you can find my thoughts on that in this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/83wx5c/dota_plus_analysis_by_an_exf2p_game_product/dvlxgs7/?context=3)  Thanks for reading everyone would love to answer any questions and I'll update this post if I got any details wrong due to the newness of this feature.   (EDIT: Made several corrections related to level purchasing being limited to TI Battle Passes)  And if you or someone you know is looking for a Product Manager or Customer Experience/Support Strategy Manager I'm looking for new job opportunities PM me!",discussion
DOTA2 has turned into a psychological game where you have to babysit your teammates so they don't tilt morally,self.DotA2,"What the hell has happened with DOTA? It seems that if you are down 5 kills at 10 minutes you have lost the game and it's time to feed couriers. It's time to sell your items and just run down mid we are 5 kills down at 10 minutes so we are 1k behind or something we lost!   Why do I feel like every game I play I have to morally babysit people who are unstable mentally? All they do is cry when someone makes a mistake (in the 5k bracket mind you) blame people and never own up to their own mistakes.  The change to the report system is definitely to blame I believe. For the past 2-3 weeks I have not gotten a single report back from ""Thank you for reporting..."". I have only gotten <1> report per week and I feel like toxicity is completely at it's highest it's been in a VERY long time.   There is no more threat of low priority and even if low priority would come you would just pay $0.4 and play 4-5 games of low prio with some bots and be out of low prio in ~25 minutes.   Low priority should DETER people from being toxic/whining crybabies. Reports should have weight to them so should commends. Commends have been useless since their inception it's just a worthless stat that doesn't do anything we get unlimited numbers of those - but things like reports to punish people that ruin games? Yeah you get ONE a week.   *Nearly* every single game of DOTA that I seem to play more and more I understand that this game is 75% if not more how you look at the game. If you tilt from minute one cuz you got ganked on mid by two roamers and yell at your team you will play garbage and you will probably lose because you don't do any favours to your team for such a whiny cunt. Try to be nice and not tilt.  For the record my behaviour score is 8.9k.  TLDR: No more threat of Low Prio toxicity highest it's ever been reports do nothing.",discussion

Legal Analysis of the ESL Genting Situation & DMCA,self.DotA2,Hey Everyone  This sub has exploded with anger over the handling of ESL Genting and ESLs decision to issue DMCA takedown notices to a wide array of streams broadcasting the games on Twitch. While some of the public dialogue surrounding these issues shows a good understanding of the underlying legal concepts the majority of it does not. I figured Id drop in here and make sure everyone has a full grasp of the legal nuances of this situation as well as to give my own take on how this should/will play out. Before I do Ill include some quick info on my qualifications/background so you know who I am and why Im in a position to analyze all of this. Feel free to skip that section if you dont care (which btw you should because a lot of people are trusting bold statements with little support) or skip all the way to the bottom for the TL;DR if you want to avoid the massive wall of text Im about to write.  ---  **My background**: Ive practiced law since 2013 and own the worlds only law firm that is solely dedicated to esports (www.esglaw.com). My client base includes esports teams broadcast talent and esports-focused businesses. I also want to mention that I work with BTSwhile everything Im about to say is my own opinion and does not reflect viewpoints of BTS the bias here is worth noting as they had a stream taken down as well. FWIW I also have a number of personal friends working on esports at ESL and Facebook as well so its not like my biases only flow in one direction. Through my work in this industry I have dealt with the DMCA on behalf of dozens of clients in a wide array of contexts. If you want a more full bio [here you go](http://esglaw.com/founder).  ---  **The basics of copyright law**:  Under Title 17 USC  106 of the Copyright Act copyright holders have the exclusive right to publicly perform the work and to reproduce copies of the work. However copyright holders can grant licenses to others to use the protected work at the discretion of the copyright holder.  Typical streams include several discrete elements: The game oral commentary video showing the face(s) of the player(s) background music or other audio etc. Its important to separate these elements because each potentially implicates a separate copyright holder. When it comes to the game itself the IP rights belong exclusively to games publisher (in this case Valve)the images sounds and underlying code are all wholly owned by Valve and the use of that IP is subject to Valves policies on the subject. This means that Valve could prevent anyone from streaming its game in any context in its sole and absolute discretion. However like most game publishers Valve has chosen to go an entirely different route and maintains a [blanket policy](http://store.steampowered.com/video_policy) that people are allowed to stream Dota gameplay. Its good advertising after all.  ---  **The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)**:  The rights and obligations of parties under the DMCA are somewhat complex and have been the subject of [billion-dollar litigation](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viacom_International_Inc._v._YouTube_Inc.). For our purposes the most important aspect of the DMCA is the [safe harbor provision](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512) which is intended to shelter service providers from the infringing activities of their users. This provision states that a service provider (such as Twitch) cannot be held liable for copyright infringement on its site if it does not have actual knowledge of the infringement is not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent and upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness acts expeditiously to remove or disable access to the infringing material.  In theory this provision makes a hell of a lot of sense. There is way too much content published on Twitch YouTube etc. for those sites to constantly scour new posts and determine whether or not they infringe on any of the copyrights that exist in the ether. The DMCA shifts the burden of handling the issue to the content creators themselves through the takedown notice system. However in order to gain the vital liability protection provided by the DMCA a service provider must act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the infringing material once the copyright holder affirmatively identifies the infringement.   In short if Twitch receives a takedown notice that checks all of the boxes they HAVE to take down the content. On the flip side the content creator can file a counter takedown notice with Twitch and if that checks all of the boxes Twitch MUST reinstate the content. The process is well articulated in an [image](https://twitter.com/JustinWong/status/918844085150015488) tweeted by Twitch VP Justin Wong a few months ago.  ---  *With me so far? Ok awesome. Now lets apply your crash course in copyright law to this situation*   **Who is the rights holder?**  It completely depends about which rights youre talking. ESL is producing the event and they maintain a wide array of copyrights in and to various elements of that broadcast (overlay shoulder content casting etc.). This means that someone could not simply re-broadcast the ESL stream on another platform. However thats not whats happening here; instead third parties are simply broadcasting the same gameplay which is made available through DotaTV and adding their own casting etc. on top of that gameplay. Absent some form of contractual agreement on the subject between Valve and ESL [*NOTE: this could exist though it would be unusual*] the rights in and to the actual gameplay and assets are not ESLs to control. The problem is Valves stance on the streaming of gameplay from a third party event isnt clear at present   **Valves Role & Statement**:  As noted above Valves base policy allows all gameplay to be broadcast. However there is a wrinkle; Valves [October 13 2017 statement](http://blog.dota2.com/2017/10/broadcasting-dota-2/) tackled the issue of broadcasting gameplay from a tournament organized by a third party. This statement was partially quoted in [ESLs response to the controversy](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7skypn/on_streams_from_esl_genting/). Im going to include the most relevant paragraph below in full:  >To that end in addition to the official fully-produced streams from the tournament organizer itself we believe that anyone should be able to broadcast a match from DotaTV for their audience. However we dont think they should do so in a commercial manner or in a way that directly competes with the tournament organizers stream. This means no advertising/branding overlays and no sponsorships. It also means not using any of the official broadcasts content such as caster audio camerawork overlays interstitial content and so on. Finally this is not permission for studios to broadcast each others events. In general everyone should play nice together and we think the boundaries should be pretty clear.  **Unfortunately this statement isnt particularly clear**. It does say that anyone should be able to broadcast a match from DotaTV for their audience but it also says that such broadcasts cannot be done in a commercial manner OR in a way that directly competes with the tournament organizers stream. Though they provided more context on what qualifies as commercial (no advertising/branding overlays and no sponsorships) Valve **did not define what they mean by directly competes** and reasonably minds can undoubtedly differ on that point. The caveat at the end of the statement only further muddies the watersI dont know what qualifies as a studio in Valves eyes which makes it impossible to tell who is and is not permitted to stream gameplay from another partys event.  Contrary to Valves concluding sentence the boundaries arent particularly clear. And while I appreciate the fact that theyve begun to tackle the issue were a long way from having clearly articulated rules that will govern these types of issues and how Valve wants them to be resolved.  ---  **Applying the current vague standard to this dispute**:  While I hope Valve will further clarify its position moving forward we still have a present dispute to resolve. Lets go party by party.  **Twitch**: Anyone blaming Twitch just doesnt get it. The framework of the DMCA functionally requires Twitch to do exactly what it did in this case. A content provider as massive as Twitch needs the liability shield offered by the DMCA. There is simply too much content on Twitch for it to identify all infringing content that it posted on its sitethe only way for Twitch to avoid liability is to make sure it acts expeditiously to remove or disable access to the infringing material as soon as it is identified by a third party. And while I would like to see the law changed so that a higher bar is set for determining when a claim of infringement is sufficiently valid to result in a takedown Twitchs actions were the most legally and economically sound option presently available.  **ESL**: On a basic level I get itthey have a presumptively lucrative deal with Facebook and it has to be frustrating to see various Twitch channels pulling in significant viewership based solely on the gameplay from their event. I also think the esports community is absurdly short-sighted and ignorant to the various business dynamics that drive the content they love to consume and should be far more patient as industry leaders strive to strike the proper balance between monetization and fan demands.   Valve has expressly stated that a third party cannot broadcast content from DotaTV in a way that directly competes with the tournament organizers stream and ESL is interpreting that language to protect its interests. How reasonable is ESLs interpretation? That requires a case-by-case analysis of each takedown request they issued. My cursory review suggests that some probably fit Valves vague criteria while others did not. But the core problem here is that the standard itself is vague leaving room for both sides to be upset because theyre interpreting it through their own self-interested lens.  With that said absent some form of agreement between Valve and ESL on this issue (which seems unlikely) ESL doesnt have the legal right to have content removed from Twitch based on alleged infringement of IP rights it doesnt hold. The underlying gameplay made available via DotaTV is owned by Valve not ESL. I recognize that ESL is simply acting based on its interpretation of Valves statement but that statement doesnt shift any legal rights from Valve to a tournament organizer; it merely articulates additional principles related to the rights grant made by Valve to stream Dota gameplay. ESL is in a tough position but from my seat Im not sure Id be filing a bunch of takedown notices to solve the problem.  **Twitch Streamers**: Anyone streaming this type of content needs to make sure they learn the DMCA. If you believe your content was taken down improperly you have the right to file a counter takedown notice. As has been noted in other threads you may also have the right to file suit against ESL under 17 U.S.C.  512(f)(1) which establishes civil liability for any party that knowingly materially misrepresents under [the DMCA] that material or activity is infringing. Of course litigation is extremely expensive and time consuming. Im by no means endorsing this option and think its incredibly unlikely anyone files suit in this case. I just wanted to point out that it exists and add a statutory reference so people can better understand what this does and does not mean; for example the people saying ESL reps can go to jail for this arent well-grounded in reality.   **Valve**: As the rights holder in this instance Valve has a great deal at stake in the resolution of the issue. While ESL was merely trying to enforce its understanding of Valves position those takedown claims have the potential to threaten Valves broad and substantial IP rights with respect to the game it publishes. Valve does not want to cede any ownership over their raw gameplay. If they did they would lose an incredible amount of leverage/control as it relates to the growth and monetization of their game.   The ball is squarely in Valves court. By far the best way to resolve this dispute and any similar disputes down the road is for Valve to (1) clarify its policy on what is and is not permitted and (2) enforce that policy. At present Valve is putting all competition organizers in an impossible position; assuming for the moment that Valves policy was clearly articulated and ESL was correct that the Twitch streams shouldnt have been allowed only Valve is in a position to actually issue those takedown requests to ensure that everyone follows the rules.  [*SIDE NOTE: There have been some very interesting arguments made that a player's actions can be original/transformative thereby creating some form of independent IP rights in and to gameplay ([example 1](http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=penn_law_review) and [example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5uo4qk/remember_spectatefaker_now_skt_t1_is_filing_dmcas/ddvkqez/) but these are just theories. There is no court decision on point and I've talked to a handful of 30+ year IP attorneys that see this as a non-starter. Valve owns raw gameplay. Period.]  Reasonable minds can disagree over what policy would be best in this instance. Fans want to consume content on whatever platform and from whatever source they desire so they will always want the most open policy imaginable. Competition organizers on the other hand invest a lot of time and money into their events and dont want their potential monetization undercut by third party broadcasts. Whatever your personal opinion remember that there are directly competing interests here that may have broader implications for both Dota and the esports industry as a whole.   ---  **TL;DR**: Copyright law is complex. The DMCA required Twitch to take down the streams once properly noticed by ESL and the streamers can file counter takedown notices that will allow them to put their streams back up if they believe they have the right to stream this content. ESLs DMCA takedown notices likely arent appropriate because they dont own the underlying gameplay but theyre in a tough position and I think the hate is largely unfair and misses the nuance of the situation. The core problem here is that Valves policy is vague. Valve needs to clarify its position on the streaming of gameplay from a third party event and then actively enforce that policy so that everyone can have clear expectations surrounding what they can and cannot do thereby enabling them to make informed business decisions from the outset. Also copyright law is complex. ,discussion

Don't be sucked in by the latest PR statement,self.DotA2,"Edit 3: [Problem solved!](http://blog.dota2.com/2018/01/dotatv-streaming/)  The latest tweet and further ""clarifications"" from ESL are meaningless because ESL HAVE NO RIGHTS TO THE DOTATV CONTENT in the first place so they don't get to set the conditions for streamers.   These clarifications are PR statements carefully crafted to give the idea that ESL get to decide which streams are acceptable and therefore which ones they can take down. They may have achieved that so far but only by abusing the law not by right.   Until Valve change their policy any stream that only uses data from the client is fine and we don't need pointers from ESL on who they will and will not allow to stream from the client. That's been the case for as long as I've played dota. The idea that ESL can ""clarify"" something that ISN'T EVEN THEIR POLICY is arrogant and condescending.  The idea that ESL is now ""going easy"" on streamers because they've realised the error of their ways is a fallacy. They had no rights to terminate non-commercial streams in the first place. However their post is worded as if they're doing the community a favor by allowing streamers who are already allowed to stream in the first place.   They're hoping their new attitude will make you forget something crucial: they chose to abuse the DMCA process to shut down streams that weren't breaking the rules.  Edit: In the [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7sw0w5/i_am_ulrich_schulze_here_to_answer_your_questions/) ESL are still stating ""We create and produce the content of the tournament we do have legal agreements with Valve for those tournaments and we had streams taken down which violated a policy laid out and publicly communicated."" Organisers have **never owned the rebroadcasting rights to the games** only to the content they add. Many people watch their events because they add quality content and use quality platforms but many people also just watch in DotaTV.  Until Valve tell us differently streamers like Mike Le Phoenix were punished by a fraudulent use of the DMCA process. The discussion about Facebook and its problems is important but don't forget that this company chose to break the law to stifle competition because they had a poor offering and **still won't back down from their position**.  Edit 2: [Tweets like this](https://twitter.com/william_partin/status/956605040256528384) still display a fundamental misunderstanding of the current policy and of why the subreddit is outraged. This isn't about getting content for free pirating or being anti-capitalist: VALVE ALLOW RESTREAMS. Anyone commenting from ESL to the general public needs to pause for a second and understand that **the current publicly published policy from the official rights holder allows free and open rebroadcasts from DotaTV at any time**. Any kind of journalist worth his salt would try to figure out why this is such a hot button issue that has caused so much outrage.  This man has done the virtual equivalent of putting his fingers in his ears and going ""LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU"" because he doesn't like the way things are being said. He comes across as very sensitive because he's tired of people being angry and raging. This is a vital discourse that will have ramifications on the game and its audience figures for years to come.  TLDR: If Valve want to change things so that orgs own the games they can but they don't right now and ESL just doesn't get it.",discussion
Every player at TI5 should get paid.,self.DotA2,At this stage The International is not just a competition but almost a celebration of the year in Dota. Teams and fans come from all around the world to watch the games interact with the personalities and make new friends.  That's why I think that each player who makes it into TI should be given an amount of money. That way nobody walks away empty-handed. Even the earliest losers are still able to show something for their year of hard work.  And don't say that 'A Free Vacation To Seattle!' is their reward. That doesn't pay rent or buy food.  Imagine if each player upon making it into TI got ten thousand dollars. 10k.  50k a team. 16 teams. That is 800000. Eight Hundred-Thousand. That barely brings the prize pool below 16 million.  Suddenly nobody is a loser. Everyone is able to pocket something. Crashing out early is never good but at least it isn't the end of a career at least it doesn't mean you spent a year working and toiling for nothing.  Alot of these teams don't make big money. SEA scene NA scene. Tier2ish teams. Ten Thousand can change alot for somebody.  I would love to see this. Let TI be more of a celebration then a cut-throat competition. The winners will still rake in millions why not spread the wealth and help the Dota2 Esport community just a little bit.,discussion

Now that TI is over and there's a down period let's seriously discuss Valve's increasingly anti-consumer model for cosmetics and the ongoing slippery slope over the past few years.,self.DotA2,"I feel like this is something to be talked about now rather than next TI. This is a serious talk about the culmination of a business model that's been getting worse for the consumers over the past few years.  Let me start with a disclaimer; Valve has down a bunch of amazing things in the past few years too; there have been tons of awesome new features/cosmetics that are very enjoyable (ie: quests in battle pass chat wheel sounds campaign etc). So when the inevitable 2-3 retards chanting ""if you don't like their things why buy it? vote with your wallet""; it's because Valve bundles everything they do very well with the shit they do poorly. A competent and rational consumer should definitely call out the bad things especially when they've escalated to this level.  So what bad things am I referring to? Well if you were here during the whole immortal 3 fiasco it's fairly obvious that it's the issue of gambling....sort of. Over the past few years it's pretty obvious that Valve is murdering trading for profits. That's totally fine IMO; good traders will adapt and profit trading isn't and shouldn't be Valve's primary focus anyway. However lately they've been pushing it to the point where it's really bad for the average consumer as well.  What they're doing right now is essentially pure gambling just without the proper odds public or any form of regulation around it. While they've always had a model like this it's only become a serious problem now because there were always **alternatives** around it. Years back you had choices. If you wanted to push your luck and try for the ""lottery"" you could go for it. If you don't like to gamble you can always get item ""x"" off the steam market or in trading. However with the restrictions now there is no alternative (besides gift trading which is very very risky to any non-experienced trader). For some reason they think a 1.3 year trading/marketing restriction is somehow at ALL acceptable. Worse yet there are people defending this saying it preserves value.+  Since it's far too late for this TI can we please come together as a community to petition to Valve to make the restrictions at least somewhat reasonable for the next TI? Just make the items tradable/marketable after TI is over to protect your BP level sales....that's pretty reasonable and fair; and above all it's a realistic wait for people who want the items released but don't want to put hundreds of dollars in to gamble for it.   Alternatively if they insist on keeping Gambling as the ""only real"" way to get the items in any reasonable amount of time PLEASE PUBLICIZE THE ODDS. I know you like loopholing around the fact that items ""don't have value"" but anyone in the steam community knows that's full of shit. If gambling is going to be the only realistic way to get the items at least follow some of the reasonable regulations around it. People forget that there ARE kids playing this game....as a trader I know people who are under 18 and have spent an extra few hundred dollars trying to get the hat they wanted; they were frustrated by not getting the rare drop (mostly golden linas) despite already spending a lot of money and not fully understanding the sunk cost fallacy dumped more money in trying to get it(some are level 2000+ and still haven't gotten it very very frustrated). I REALLY don't think it's ok to exploit these people especially if they're underage.  Oh and just to be clear I'm not posting this because I'm mad I didn't get lucky or some shit (Didn't even open my treasures 1 and 2 bar getting the base 6 opened 3's to try to get some 50 levels so i could get to 2000 more cheaply). I'm posting this as I'm very concerned of the slippery slope they're walking in terms of fucking with consumers. Year after year I post my concerns and year after year people ignore me with stupid shilling until it's closing on  to a breaking point where the community finally reacted; hopefully people finally pay attention this year before we get a really fucked up scenario at TI8.   +Side Rant: If you actually think this**(Edit:""This"" referring to the fact that a 1.3 year market restriction preserves value; suppose i should've been more clear)** I'm sorry but you're a fucking retard. In a purely demand driven market if you're somehow delusional enough to think that making your items be worth $0 for 1.3 years only to be marketable when all hype/interest surrounding them has died you're part of the problem. Them restricting trade doesn't make the item ""more exclusive""....if anything it adds more supply to the market. Previously one iteration of item ""x"" could be passed around to many; now anytime someone wants an item they HAVE to open a new one adding to the supply. It seriously pissed me off when I saw people shilling for valve for this reason.   **TL;DR: Valve's induced ""forced"" gambling system is bad for consumers; restrictions on trade/marketing make gambling ""only option"" to get the item. Please make restrictions more realistic or regulate the gambling system more.**  **Edit: Just to be clear I'm not saying valve is forcing you to buy items...that's a stupid strawman that people are bound to make for some reason without reading. I'm saying that if you WANT to obtain an item more and more Valve is making gambling the only option to get it- that's what's not okay to me.**   Final Edit: Alright so basically I fucked up. After taking a night to think about it I definitely shouldn't have been so abrasive; I'm pretty passionate about the topic and was pretty salty about how cosmetics issues are treated in general over the past few years. I'm not going to delete anything and pussy out but leave it up as a reminder so hopefully I won't be as big of an ass next time.  I woke up again to a lot more comments. Since I don't have the time today to individually address all of them I think it'll be easier if I just make it more clear overall.   When it comes to WHY there's the 1.3 year restriction a lot of you alluded to it in general. Ofc we can only speculate but I also believe that it's because they want to ""protect"" the battle-pass purchasers. They don't want people to feel like shit 3 months after the pass but 1.3 years after the pass (after their next pass has ended) when the markets flood with cheap immortals. In general I think if this is the case they're greatly overvaluing how forward thinking people in general are. Protecting their pass is finebut I feel the 1.3 years is still ridiculous.  Also the key part here is that people THINK that the 1.3 years will increase the value of their items. I've seen many people talk about how having this stuff untradable better protects their purchase's value. They're **wrong** ;I don't know any nicer way to put it. Here's why. Most people think that these restrictions would decrease supply and thus increase the price/value. However despite me not agreeing it works in Dota 2 hats (the economy has extraneous factors from the base model assumption) supply is largely irrelevant especially in a long run (multiple months +). From my 6 years experience Dota 2 is a primarily demand driven economy possibly from most of its commodities being potentially ""infinite in supply"" as well as near 0 cost of production. You can shit on the experience or my intellect all you want but I have more than just my anecdotal evidence. Nearly 99% of all notable items w. very low supply (Ie: Weta exclusives Golden Baby Roshans Rainmaker etc) have all dropped in value even when you isolate for extraneous factors (ie: duping benefactors) - the only exceptions I could find to this are betting items (DC hook Stache etc) which in general fall into a cyclical increase in value for a different kind of demand. In all these cases there's strong correlation to complementary factors in all these price drops leading to my strong belief that demand is the driving factor.  So why is this relevant? Well think of it this way. Selling Ti7 items after Ti7 everyone's interested in the ti7 stuff. Selling ti7 items after ti8 everyone's going to be focused on the ti8 things. Demand by that time will be in general much lower killing the price. And keep in mind supply was only ""artificially restricted"". In my opinion there'd be a lot more ""real supply"" once it hits due to the limitation of recirculation of the items (only way to get it is to get valve to ""produce a new one). Anyone who wants data/evidence of this can look at the volumes on the past TI immortals; as the restrictions have increased the volume on all the base immortals have also increased (not just on the scm but if the volume tracker is to be believed in dota in general). It's akin to 40% of what you put in in 3 months or 10% of what you put in in 1.3 years; only plus is that you get to convince yourself it wasn't a bad financial decision in the meantime to not wait.  More-over there's a very strong opportunity cost in the meantime. And this isn't just an issue for traders; it hits normal consumers too. Lets say you have this golden lina item that would fluctuate between hypothetically 50-100$ through the year as she becomes popular/not popular. What if during that time the 2 new arcanas for the new heroes come out and you need to sell the lina immortal to fund it? Well too bad. Tons of profit opportunities OR just general quality of life/interest opportunities are missed with these kinds of restrictions.  So no your items will **NOT** be worth more because of the restrictions in ANY sense but your feelings. They'll be intrinsically worth less than their historical counter parts in general (isolating from other complementary/patch factors that come along the way) and literally worth nothing until the date expires.   **HOWEVER* none of this is directly relevant to my case and point. I don't really know why I wrote those paragraphs. **My main point is I don't want gambling to be the only way to get an item; either introduce an alternative or at the very least regulate it SOMEWHAT(ie: public show odds). The lessening of the trade restrictions was just the first and simplest way of creating said alternative; if they have another way to do it then I don't really care too much about their removal.**",discussion

In the old days Major bugs were the only things posted to this subreddit and if Valve fixed that bug the subreddit would be ecstatic about the fix. Nowadays we have people making threads about how bad the Christmas event is or even just typos in descriptions. The amount of hate I see towards Valve is unreal.   /r/DotA2 has become spoiled. It started with Valve seeing this subreddit and fixing major bugs. Then they started adding suggestions. Now if EVERY single thing mentioned on this subreddit is not added everyone BLOWS up. It's like raising a child and giving him candy one night when he doesn't usually get candy. Now you start giving him candy every Friday night. Now he expects it. If you stop giving him candy on Friday night the child is gonna throw a temper tantrum. It's annoying. Quit being a child /r/DotA2  /End complaint of complaining-  EDIT: Didn't know this would blow up like it did. Let me clarify a few things. First of all when I get to work every morning I always browse the front page of /r/dota2. It used to bring me much joy to look at RTZ highlights and EE clips but those are seemingly starting to diminish. The front page this morning was literally 75% complaints about frostivus cosmetics minor things etc... You would think with the large amount of pro games nowadays the front page would be full of highlights and match discussion or you know... Dota 2.  And yes I am one of those people who spend thousands on this game. I had a level 2000 battle pass. But I will never feel so entitled that I can TELL Valve what to do with their game.",discussion

Could Valve be measuring interest in a standalone RPG based on Dota lore?,self.DotA2,First off: Valve has a history of measuring interest by just flinging stuff to the wall and seeing what sticks or using post-leaks (including code hinting at future changes and taking note from potential backlash in the community).  I was thinking about Siltbreaker. Could it be that Valve or at least the team working on Dota is toying with the idea of creating a standalone RPG based on Dota lore and Siltbreaker is their way of measuring interest in something like it?  I mean there is so much lore that a lot of it can be used for quests.  Hell they could hire the Torchlight devs to make it for them. They will be done with their new game [probably late this year](http://www.runicgames.com/blog/hob/) and must be looking for a new venture to sink their teeth in. Include a character creator. Have players encounter our heroes as NPC's in te game with some of them being recruitable.   I mean they have the tech. They have the lore. They have the playerbase. And maybe now they have a measure at how popular such an endeavour would be. Price it for about 15-20 on the market and I'm sure milions of copies will be sold.  Valve might not be making single-player games anymore as it involves so much hoops to go through but most of the variables in this case are set. They just have to fill them in.  And seeing as Valve spends most of their time reading reddit anyway why not upvote this if you like the idea of a standalone Dota RPG.,discussion

I'm sorry Cr1t,self.DotA2,"Like no **lemme just get things straight cr1t did not draft well either game though we won't know whether those were his executive decisions or the team as a whole goofed hard in strats.  I'm in no way saying that cr1t didn't underpreform as a drafter and perhaps as a player in EG's last 2 matches.**    The purpose of this post isn't to somehow excuse the drafting goof vs empire.  **It's to send my condolences to cr1t that /r/DotA2 has quickly turned him into a standalone scapegoat for their frustrations with EG's elimination**.  Over the past 6 hours I have seen almost nothing but undiluted vehement disdain towards cr1t's alleged failures in empire vs EG.  Over the past 6 hours months upon months as well as an entire groupstage of cr1ts amazing team play and legendary support action was burned upon the great reddit bonfire of shifting the blame.    This rabid pitchforking mainly carried out by people who rooted for EG or specifically rooted for a certain player on EG is not a random knee-jerk reaction.  **It's a damn obvious attempt from EG fans to try and create both an internal and external narrative that cr1t is the only reason EG got absolutely destroyed to stifle any criticism of the team as a whole specifically the favorite players on that team**.    How do I know this?  Tell me the one thing that's been exactly as prevalent in the last 6 hours as hate on cr1t.  **Oh yeah support excuses and condolences for arteezy and occasionally other star players on EG.**  It's clear what's happening.  Instead of admitting that a team as a whole failed to perform in any meaningful capacity in that elimination match it's much easier to try to convince oneself and others that the loss was entire due to some ""black sheep"" player who dragged the entire team down and must be quickly kicked from the team and burned in effigy and that their golden boy Artour was again gifted with a shit teammate and did the best he could.  Why do I have a problem with this?  Here's some hard truth.  **Arteezy did not do the best he could.  No one on EG did the best they could that match.**  While this is obvious to anyone who watched the match through a clear lens I'll elaborate a bit on the big non-cr1t failure points that shone that game.  Yes arteezy was given pl against heroes that can counter him.  **However arteezy was not powerless to veto this choice.  The fact that he didn't request a different carry from his large pool of carries is that he knew damn well he could win as pl in that game**.  This isn't league where any old hero has several rock-paper-scissor counters that completely shuts down any chance of anything.  Ultimately it's coordination and cohesiveness that wins a game and a player and team who displays those easily overcomes any theoretical counters to his hero from the other side.  Now can it be said that arteezy proceeded to demonstrate any such coordination in his pl play that game?  Fuck to the no.  While not uncontested EG provided him a relatively farmable early game which allowed him to accrue some meaningful items.  However he then proceeded to make his net worth absolutely irrelevant by repeatedly dying to ganks by empire's kill team.  Yes it's the responsibility of the whole team to prevent such ganks but a carry who got farm early game but went nowhere with it is still not a carry who played an effective game and certainly did not do his best.  The second game arteezy was given an even easier farm situation and given a hero terrorblade which was more than robust enough if not even resistant to empire's lineup.  He was given by his team an even more interrupted farming phase during which he dominated the net worth charts.  I couldn't wait to see him throw his net worth around like all terror blades eventually do by turning into spooky form and just melting a few heroes or delete a lane of racks.  **However in a long game a lot of which EG spent either at advantage or even I not once saw terrorblade do anything more meaningful than threaten a tier 3 push which while not horrible is far below expectations for a fed arteezy core**.  Arteezy proceeded to flounder for the entire duration of game 2 and eventually his inefficacy allowed him to get outcarried by empire's mirana and sven.  Since this post is all about being fair **I will note that arteezy wasn't the sole issue either**.  Like I mentioned above the supporting cast Zai and Cr1t as well by extension the rest of the team also failed in preventing rtz from getting bullied by empire's initiators.  **In fact both games witnessed an almost comical lack of map sense from EG as a whole**.  Empire ran a hunting party strategy both games and both games they with ease ambushed key members of EG's lineup and deleted them even if they were heroes resistant to deletion like pl or puck.  Whether it's Empire who stepped it up or EG who stepped it down the result is the same.  **EG got outplayed hard as a whole beyond any level of variance that can be blamed to poor draft.**  I think a large portion of EG's fanbase does not want to accept this and this is why such concentrated criticism (like I've seen such levels before maybe once if ever despite there being A LOT of cases where an individual player was actually at fault more than the team) is being launched specifically at cr1t.    Now that I've explained myself as much as I care to:  **I'm sorry cr1t.**  **I'm sorry that all of your gargantuan achievements and contributions to your team have evaporated overnight in the kettle of public opinion.**  **I'm sorry that in a time where you need to collect yourself and would (probably) appreciate some confidence from your teammates and fans (the same support that's already been offered to your teammates by this sub) you're finding almost nothing but mudthrowing and demands for your removal.**  **I'm sorry that in addition to the burden you already carry of having not done your part and your best people are trying to force the burden of an entire team's defeat squarely on your shoulders alone.**  **I'm sorry that reddit for all its advantages is so assymetric in its comprehensive thinking compassion and rationality and that you got the proverbial short stick of that assymetry.**   **And finally I'm sorry to the dissapointed EG fans that understand that blaming cr1t alone for what happened is wrong and immature and I wish that you guys will get to see EG stand back up from this.**  I doubt cr1t will see this (in fact I hope not since to see this he'd have to wade through an ocean of disdain towards him) and as such this is more something I wanted to get off of my chest my sum reaction to all of the different frustrating bullshit I've seen this past night.  From where I stand everything I've said would have gone without saying in any sane world and this is a departure from the tone I usually like to take.  As such I don't really plan to argue any of these points.  If you seek to somehow justify the pillorying cr1t's received I really have nothing to say to you other than go right the fuck ahead.  ---------------------Rant over ------------------------  EDIT at 3 hour mark:  Thank you for the gold kind stranger.

The All Draft game mode: What you should know.,self.DotA2,"*""Oh it's this thread again""*  /r/dota2 2015.      **I've been living under a rock what are you talking about?**   Recently some people (including myself) started suggesting that the current all pick is not the best option especially for ranked. Mainly due to the so-called ""Flavor of the month"" heroes or heroes that are arguably stronger or easier to execute in the current patch and that get picked so often it gets annoying. I.e. Void and Tinker in 6.82 Troll and Sniper in 6.83 or Storm and Techies (among other things) in 6.84.   The idea is to ""encourage"" people to play other heroes through simply banning some of the most annoying ones.   For that end Valve should introduce a new game mode let's call it **All Draft**. People who play this mode have to ban a hero removing it from the pool and making it impossible for either the teammates or the enemy to pick it and then proceed to pick the heroes normally from a reduced hero pool. The rules are yet to be determined in a more exact manner but the most reasonable variant would be **blind ban** which prevents both your and enemy team from seeing what hero any particular person banned until the picking phase begins.   **Ok but what's the point of blind ban?**   As already mentioned compromise is everything.   1. This means that **up to** 10 heroes are banned every game in reality some bans will almost always overlap as each person only bans their most hated hero so **some** flavor of the month heroes will be available to pick anyway. It's alright the goal is not to just ban as much as possible it is to improve the game experience for everyone at least to some extent.   2. This way you can also prevent your own teammates from picking a certain hero without them knowing it is you and proceeding to feed because it was their favorite hero or otherwise holding a grudge against you.   **This is strange. Has this ever been a thing anywhere?**   Yeah [Heroes of Newerth](http://hon.gamepedia.com/Game_Modes#Blind_Ban) (another MOBA that used to be quite popular in the days before Dota 2) has it and nobody complained.   **What if I want to play usual ranked all pick not this crap?**   Feel free to. It should be an alternative to ranked all pick not replacement. Until the test phase is over at least.   **If we're gonna have another mode in ranked an easier one at that this will make getting mmr easy and devalue it making rmm pointless in general**   Some would argue that mmr gained by spamming a single hero *cough*blitz*cough* already doesn't reflect the skill level of the players and this mode might help change the situation.   **Who would be the biggest losers if this mode were to become more or less default?**    * Anyone who ""mains"" a hero which is considered to be ""cancer"" or ""op"" also:   * Account boosters picking the same heroes and doing the same stuff every game in particular   * Famous personalities/streamers with a well-known preferred hero (RIP Broxy Sumail and Waga TA marathons)     **Who's gonna be obvious and potential winners?**    * YOU   * That guy   * People who like to random (ban Meepo @ click random) ^*unconfirmed*    * People who got mad at a certain hero last game and want to kill it with fire     **Aren't people who play in parties going to have an unfair advantage by being able to coordinate bans?**   Could be but parties generally get to play with and against other parties so the advantage is mitigated. For a 5-stack this mode could be just a quicker alternative to Captain's Mode btw.   **Go play CM scrub.**   Go **** urself. People said that concerning the then-new ranked all pick mode with picking in turns because it also seemed too tryhard and didn't end well for those who always waited for the 5 last seconds to pick their fotm hero. Now the next step for improvement is in line.      I don't have anything else in mind so please add to the discussion if you will or tell me where you think I'm wrong.   Also feel free to copypaste this for ourjust cause.   **Tl;dr:**                                                                                                            Valve     Add This   Please!                 Edit: formatting   Edit2: The questions raised in this thread  post is 3 hours old.   **So my whole team bans 5 counters to my hero and I win?**   Might happen but your teammates have their own counters to worry about so you have to convince them which is not as easy as it sounds. Also they can pick your hero instead of you if they have the first pick after seeing the bans. Also they can ban 5 counters to some other hero and wreck you instead. There are a lot of factors.   **What are you talking about? A coordinated team will be able to surprise coordinate their bans and wreck an uncoordinated team**   Did you not read the whole thing? First of all 5-stacks only play against 5-stacks (establishing proper team communication is up to them) no problem here. Secondly 4-stacks aren't allowed to queue in ranked so there's that. Finally my experience tells me that 2-stacks are more often than not matched with 3-stacks and against 2+3 on the enemy team so the conditions are equal. You could say that when there are really few people playing on a server in a particular hour then 3-stack + 2 random guys gets matched against a 2-stack and 3 random guys which favours the first team heavily but I would argue that already today in rmm during the hours when fewer people play 6k mmr players get matched with/against 4k mmr and there goes your disadvantage.   **What if I want to practice a certain hero and it happens to be a fotm one?**   Firstly the ranked all pick does not disappear. The one without bans. Secondly if All Draft turns out to be a HUGE success and does indeed replace ranked All Pick you still have the normal AP. That's what you want ""practice"" right? Not ""grind the only hero I play for mmr""?      Edit 3  the post is 5 hours old.   **Banning fotm heroes actually prevents you from getting better at Dota 2. Where is my room for improvement? How do I learn to counterpick if I can simply ban?**   *Youareplayingagainstalliance.txt*   But seriously what does that even mean? Is the ultimate goal of Dota to ""git gud"" or to have fun? Even then how can you get better if you have to deal with the same stuff game after game? I wouldn't say that learning that Storm Spirit for example is countered by silence and then picking Silencer Skywrath and building Orchid every game shows your high skill.",discussion

High level pubs are a disaster and inherently promote ruining by any player with ambitions.,self.DotA2,I want to point out that what I'm about to write mostly concerns the Divine 5 bracket where most players have the (distant) goal of becoming pro. The fewest players only play for fun.   I'm top 500 in EU and the environment tilts me before the game even begins. I want you to ask yourself why ruining is so prominent in high mmr. You've seen it from pros and streamers for years and it seems to only get worse. It's not because every Dota player is a self-centered psycho it's because the system is terrible and is slowing down your progress as well as making the whole experience random and a gigantic trigger.  Pubs have become the primary way to enter the professional scene. They also have always been the primary way to practice and improve. This makes them insanely important and mmr valuable. If the system sucks it can potentially ruin your career. You can argue the greatest player will always find a way I argue t2 players also have a right for exposure and to improve over time.   The way it is right now alpha personalities have an absolute advantage. If you're willing to fuck over people you have the biggest gain. There is no deficit in doing it. Maybe you become the victim of a witch hunt but once you're a t1 player teams will pick you up regardless. And they should it's a competitive sport. Think of Noone or CCnC the 'give me mid or I'm afk' type of players. I don't blame them at all I admire them. In terms of following their goal of becoming the best player they're doing the right and the smart thing.   But not everyone is that type of personality. Some players have certain social values and they will try to avoid conflict. That type however is going to lose the fight and play core maybe 1/5 games. Why? Because the alpha types simply take the role without asking. The I'm gonna call him the 'social type' is gonna step down and say to himself whatever I'll play core next game. But he probably won't and he will have so much less practice that he will never ever catch up to people who spam their role every game. And the system doesn't protect these people at all. I'll go as far to say the system promotes ruining for your own advantage.   This means there really is only one choice. You force yourself to become the alpha type for the sake of your own career. In a competitive environment you would have to be stupid to put your own ethics in the way of your success. And this is basically the core of my argument of why the pub system is disastrous. Despite every viewer hating flamers ruiners toxic players they are super prominent at the highest level simply because it's beneficial. And on the contrary they burn out the social types and turn them into cynics because the system neither rewards nor protects them in any way. If you're a nice guy you lose. It's a fact. You can find the proof in every single high level pub.    I have thought of two solutions for this.   1. Turn all regional Div 5 brackets into inhouse leagues. Select qualified volunteers to admin them. Establish hard rules. Highest mmr/rank has highest priority to choose his role lowest picks last. No extreme flaming pinging harassing in any way. Only allow one common language. No feeding afking. If people violate these rules people can file a detailed report and admins punish them directly not through the current ticket system. If people file a clowny or false report they get punished instead.   2. Role queue. Chill the fuck out people I'm talking about Div 5 only. Since most people have one or two main roles they want to practice they should be able to do so. You can select all 5 positions or only one. Don't bind heroes lanes or items to certain roles keep it flexible. If 1pos and 2pos want to swap lanes after the picks they should be able to as it is right now. If Supports want to swap roles they should be able to. The purpose of this is simply to bring some structure into the team and not have team mates fight each other because 5 players want to play mid. If you queue with several roles selected a random one will be selected depending on what the matchmaking can find for you in the shortest time. Create a new report offense 'refused to play his attributed role'.  Will cores have longer queue times? Yes most likely. Is that a bad thing? I know me and my friends are willing to wait as long as 20 minutes if we were ensured to play their roles. On the contrary this makes supporting/offlaning more rewarding. And it improves the pub experience by preventing ruining.    Please don't shoot me down simply because you disagree with what I wrote. I put a lot of time into this I hope you can respect that. Feel free to point out mistakes in my arguments. Maybe you even agree with me then you may reward me by upvoting this thread.,discussion

The character lock is killing new players and having all the characters immediately available was one of the main pros to people starting Dota 2. Valve is moving in the wrong direction.,self.DotA2,The 20 hero lock for 25 games is taking one of the main things that new players had as an advantage over other MOBAs. Dota has every hero immediately accessible for free but now you are limited to 20 for 25 games which unless you play Turbo (which is not at all a good starting point for Dota) then you are in for a while just to get to the meat. I got an entire friend group of mine who play League and Smite to play Dota with me and they are stuck playing a bunch of heroes that they are not interested in playing. I can swap someone a hero they want but I am one person and there are four of them. It is one of the biggest detriments to them playing and is the reason 2 people are already almost done trying to play the game since they found more interesting heroes that are beyond the character lock. I should not have to be in this scenario what exactly is this character lock supposed to stop anyways? New people picking Invoker? Does that really matter in the long run as opposed to making ease of access to new players?,discussion

The DOTA 2 Economy is based on selling cosmetics why did Valve stop caring about the quality of what we get? Should we even keep suporting it?,self.DotA2,Back in 2012 and 2013 the game had a healthy and fun economy. It was really cool to open chests get unusual couriers read the items' descriptions we had fun events like Frostivus and Diretide and you could trade and gift cool stuff to your friends anytime. What happened to all of that?  1- Back then treasure chests were created as a way to introduce single-items from the Workshop artists. One example was the Dark Implements treasure from 2012. This treasure contained among the items Lina's Wizard hat Pudge's Tenderizer a cool Clinkz bow and a Mythical Disruptor mount which was a new rare thing back then. You could get duplicates yes but if you got an item you didn't want you could just immediately trade it for the one you wanted so you only had to buy one chest. Valve also used to introduce new different Unusual Courier particle effects to every single new chest they released: Sunfire Lotus Crystal Rift Amanita Divine Cursed Emerald Rubiline Diretide Corruption Frostivus Frost. If you were lucky enough you could get one of these amazing unique couriers. The hero sets were added directly to the store.  What do we have now? Sets are now in chests instead of single items and you can't get duplicates. One may think that's nice except if you get a set you don't want you can't sell or trade it back until 3 months later when no one will care about it anymore. If you really want a set you can choose to either spend $15 to get it or wait 3 months and purchase it for 20 cents instead.  What about couriers? The last time they added a new Unusual effect was on 2013's Diretide. Since then new chests only have one new courier model most of the time it can't even be Unusual and if it can you will get the same old effects over and over they made since 2012. Actually the newer chests don't even include couriers anymore.  Item descriptions? Gone. They're too lazy to write anything to expand the lore through this like they used to.  Is there any reason to purchase chests? Not in my opinion.  2- Arcanas. I've spend over $300 on Arcanas plus Prismatic gems. One would think you would get a high quality thing but here's how it goes:  - My Legion Commander arcana used to add lava-like textures to any banner/helmet/armor she used. That feature is gone. The banners now have regular textures.  - I spent $20 to add a Miasmatic Grey Prismatic gem to my Terrorblade Arcana. It doesn't work anymore and the armor's textures aren't shiny anymore even for the default model.  - I spent $55 to add a Champion's Blue Prismatic to my Techies Arcana plus the $35 from the Arcana itself it's $90. What does it do now? Half of what it used to. The Remote Mines are supposed to have the Prismatic Gem's color. Now they're always green.  - Phantom Assassin's Arcana? A disaster. Those swords left on the ground after killing an enemy hero would block jungle camps. The Critical hit noises could be heard from the fog. The colors couldn't be changed for the longest time and though most of it was fixed now the hero model has pink patches all over it from missing textures. $35 well spent.  - Shadow Fiend's? Some of the original particles are gone.  3- Restrictions. Valve claims they do it to fight the credit card frauds but don't fool yourselves. If that's the case why person-to-person sales such as TI5's secret shop's items also have restrictions? Why can't we trade gift or purchase anything as we wish anymore? Why does it only happen in DOTA but not in other of Valve's games such as CS:GO?  4- Communication with their customers. Literally non-existant. If you have an issue go sit and wait for 3 months for an automated copy-pasted response.  5- Events and pay for everything. Remember Frostivus? Me neither. In 2016 they will charge you for equiping and changing hats on your heroes. Want to equip this new Kunkka hat you just got from the new $4 chest? We will charge $1 to equip and $1 if you want to equip a different set. Add particles for $10. Then in three months we will move on to new sets and forget about this Kunkka one it will get glitches lose its particles and we won't care about it.  Is there any reason I shouldn't feel like a total retard for giving my money to a greedy company that clearly doesn't care about what they sell anymore?  Edit: found the answer:  > They simply realized we'll purchase any garbage they vomit on us and stopped caring about quality and the consumers' satisfaction.  It's our own fault.,discussion
With LGD and LFY (LGD subsidiary) both qualifying for T.I we need to discuss the Admin API Key LGD *still* holds.,self.DotA2,A few months back we became privy to the information that LGD - Ruru specifically had gained an Admin API Key. One of the numerous advantages to having that Key was gaining access to Private Matches - Aka Scrims that weren't available to the public. This means Drafts Strats and other *Important* information can be collected and used against the teams who want to practice and perfect their draft and teamwork with specific lineups...   I shouldn't have to state the absurd advantage you can gain from that information. As the common saying in our community goes half the match is decided in the draft (for the top level teams).  Now I'm not privy to the background information for this situation. It might have already been resolved. There hasn't been an update to the situation thus I'm basing the discussion with the tone that LGD *still* has that Key. If someone can correct me please do so.   Now with *both* teams qualifying admittedly with a star-studded roster it still brings into question just how much of an unfair advantage they gained. So far LGD and LFY were only able to use that information against fellow Chinese teams. They've might have gained two slots for T.I due in-part because of it.   With T.I coming up however LGD and LFY might be able to see the Stats Drafts and *Important* information of *all* T.I teams. Boot-camps are upcoming for all T.I teams. This means hidden Strats and strategies will no longer be effective in addition to everything else.       My goal with this post is to bring enough attention to this major potential issue so those in the know can respond and alleviate my worries or confirm that it's in-fact an issue Valve needs to address. Other teams attending T.I might also want this potential problem accounted for.  **TLDR; Ruru (and thus LGD and LFY) might still hold an Admin API Key and that gives them an insane advantage for the upcoming T.I and brings into question their wins in the Qualifiers.**   Edit - Original Post   https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5kwwd6/full_translation_of_lgdruru_scandal/   For those saying I'm making accusations... The quote is taken from the link above.  >In 2013 Ruru stole an API-KEY from Steam. The normal API-KEY can only view the data of public matches however the stolen one was able to view private matches and this is the reason why VPGAME in early stage can view the results of private matches. Using this API-KEY under the instruction of Ruru we build a database system which was able to browse other teams' training results(draft/build) so that we can figure out the opponents' strategies and the way to counter it. Personally I think all the players who accomplished things are legit and I don't think any of the players were using those data I think it is mostly for the stats man in the team.,discussion

Here's the plan for boycotting ESL,self.DotA2,* For god's sake don't watch the ESL stream. Not on facebook. Not on their website. Unless you actively support what they're doing watching while simultaneously hating them is the same as supporting them. They think they can bully us into giving them views - we'll show them they can't herd us like sheep.  * Support twitch streamers. BSJ died for us. And mpl. And maybe some others. And yet more people will no doubt be streaming tonight. Let's show them our appreciation and watch on twitch. Or watch directly in the Dota game client if you prefer.  * Stream yourself if you can! They can't DMCA all of us. And if they try well it's only bigger news and more protesting. Be the hero we need.  * ~~Write your congressperson~~ Write to ESL. Not like a crazy person who pretends to understand the legal ins and outs of this issue but like a level-headed human who respectfully wants your voice heard.   Lastly **Support Dota's origins.**  Dota was a custom mini-game that the players and viewers made into what it is today. Dota is nothing without all of us - they don't get to tell us how and where we watch a game. ESL legally owns the casting and content but Valve owns the games that you can view in their own client and they permit streaming on Twitch. ESL does not own the pro players. ESL does not own Dota. Dota is so special because it grew out of the passion of players and fans and we need to carry that legacy forward to keep the integrity of the game and community.    Thank you for reading. And if any pro players read this please consider speaking out. I know a lot of you are in a tournament right now and probably don't want to rock the boat but you're probably here because you love Dota like the rest of us and your word would mean a lot.   <3 and Dota to all.

Why Facebook sucks for Dota 2,self.DotA2,I tried to support the FB thing.  Here is why it fails:  1. Can't pause videos instead have to close video or mute.  Can't rewind / go back in vlog like you can under 'Videos' on Twitch 2. Constant weird audio bugs - e.g. randomly 3 different videos will start playing refresh page only fix 3. Clipping good plays etc requires much more effort ... how do you even do it? 4. When on Facebook it is not clear how many channels are live. 5. Flicking between the two English channels didn't work a number of times 6. Reduced audience interaction - Twitch chat gives a sense of being in a crowd; FB chat gives a sense of being at a funeral -hide 7. Real names used in FB means many people don't want to interact 8. I don't have a FB account - it keeps telling me to sign up.  I would rather drink raw sewage. Make the popup go away 9. FB has highly invasive and unethical practices re data collection and advertising 10. The core Dota 2 community cannot grow out an eco-system to support dota 2 events on the ESL FB page as well.  There are already several forums and video streaming platforms for this; stop splitting the community up. 11. The Dota 2 Twitch viewer count wont spike as much during these events lowering overall visibility of Dota 2 to broader Twitch community.  Please consider this for your future events.  Edit update(s): Comments also mentioned stream duration limits; Flash is a problem (ipads chromecast etc); FB navigation issues; FB stream no mobile support fullsize video clips edges; Twitch emotes nokappa; VODs flickering; emotes across the video; not working on xbox; following-day spam from FB to email asking for a long-term relationship; replays limited to 720p; browsing FB while video playing leaves video and causes multiple videos to play,discussion
The opinions on Valve on r/DotA2 and r/GlobalOffensive at the moment are so polarizing I can't believe we're talking about the same company.,self.DotA2,Basically:  - Valve recently announced that CSGO teams now can't have coaches communicating with the team mid-round (only during warmup halftime and 4 30-second timeouts). Seems like the entire community is up in arms about it and judging by their opinion Valve is a money-greedy company that's deliberately killing the game. Every single significant gameplay update in the last year has been shat on and most of the changes were reverted shortly thereafter.  - Meanwhile in the Dota 2 community the current patch is widely considered the most balanced of all time (to the point when the next patch isn't as talked about as usual) and Valve is praised for hosting probably the all-around best Dota tournament to date finally delivering on the Pit Lord reveal and even announcing a new hero outta nowhere.  I mean... damn. ,discussion
Valve conspiracy theory,self.DotA2,What if all of these times that Valve has taken a suggestion from Reddit and added or fixed something that was mentioned earlier that day/week was actually just a Valve employee posting on Reddit knowing that it would be fixed later to make it seem like they listen to the community.

Why are people complaining they didn't get what they wanted from GAMBLING and instead didn't support threads asking for everything to be marketable?,self.DotA2,'Best monetization model'.    'Gives value and exclusivity to rewards.' (That will sell for 50c ANYWAY next year).       'Not overpriced comes with all of these bonuses'. (But if you only want  one thing you gotta pay for the whole lot).      'If you don't like it go play LoL'.   'Gambling is a big thing among micro-transactions.' (and yet you're crying now because of it).   'Something can be better than other options but still not perfect.'  'Valve is not forcing you to buy anything'.    **Yeah now stfu about not getting what you wanted.**     2-3 years ago people really did complain about these things but for the most part the more recent trend has been to white knight Valve whenever things like this are brought up and I sure am certain Valve are loving further support instead of expected backlash which is further enabling them to take from the player-base for their own monetary gain.      Not making immortals marketable helps Valve into baiting people to pay for overpriced levels. You cannot pay for what you want you have to pay for everything else too and there is no guarantee of getting the item/s you want. If there was enough backlash from the community they wouldn't have gotten away with it but of course they did because people are still paying for over priced levels under the bait of exclusivity while ironically praising Valve over and over whenever the slightest of criticism appears.   You reap what you sow; if you supported more of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2ltyy1/let_us_show_valve_that_their_newest_monetization/?st=j55gc8cr&sh=3bb012b9) instead of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6c48ny/daily_reminder_that_dota_2_still_is_the/) you'd maybe be sitting here with a much better Dota 2 than you have now but you're instead sucking Valve's dick whenever anyone tries to do the former.    This is also relevant to other parts of the game. That includes cutting support for workshop artists dropping features like mods less response to suggetions and bug reports and more. In fact you can sense that the quality of the game and Valve's effort has decreased. Of course that's going to happen if you try to repress backlash. Of course that's going to happen if you praise Valve whenever they are criticized. The more you praise and white knight Valve when they're criticized for a certain action the worse the game gets. Pretty simple. Now stop crying now you should have helped us when we tried to prevent the game from getting worse.   Edit: I tried a lot of you in the comments are just defending Valve without even considering my last point. The upvotes of this post and its comments do not reflect each other. It looks like 82% of you agree but that's not the case the further I scroll down. Welp. I don't know why you think it's okay that the only purchasing method for the consumer is gambling. And you can only get treasures from paying for over-priced levels. At least some similar threads are popping up now; I'm glad about that. ,discussion

Performance issue mega thread,self.DotA2,"# **Introduction**  Hey let's give Valve a hand and crowdsource some information for them so maybe we give them an idea where to look for the performance issues. I'm sure I'm not alone with hoping to get this issue fixed rather sooner than later.  Post structure:  1. Possible fixes 2. Instructions how to perform a benchmark 3. Rows upon rows of benchmarks  Please also note that posting your performance is very helpful even if you've felt like you gained a lot of fps in this patch!  Edit1: And as another disclaimer this isn't meant for in depth testing simply a broad overview to possibly get an idea of odd outliers.   Edit2: Loads of results already thanks guys! Off to sleep going to update later.  ____  # **Possible fixes**  Section with fixes working on that right now. **Please post if you have an idea/suggestion that could help**.  ## Renderer Try to run the game with a different render engine. Possible options include:  * -nod3d9ex = The vanilla DirectX9. Might have some effects missing * -gl = Needs the OpenGL DLC likely good performance on Nvidia cards (from my testing) * -dx11 = Successor of DX9 likely good performance on AMD cards (from my testing) * -vulkan = Needs the Vulkan DLC was very good for AMD GPUs and low end CPUs before 7.00 now seems to have bugs * none of the above = standard dx9ex setting from my testing **currently** the best choice  ## Other launch commands Please remove -high -threads N or similar launch commands briefly to benchmark. Or if you want to test different ones feel free to add these options in the **details** section of the table  ## Corrupted files of the File System and/or Dota 2 * Start -> cmd -> CTRL SHIFT ENTER then type:  * ""sfc /scannow"" without "". This tests for corrupted files on the Windows System * ""dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth"" without "". Similar to sfc /scannow but repairs the Image Windows has * Steam -> Dota 2 -> Right click -> Properties -> Verify Integrity of Game Cache this verifies Dota 2 files  ## Shader cache * For AMD users turn off shader cache in Crimson via Gaming -> Global Settings -> Shader Cache * For Nvidia users disable Shader Cache in Nvidia Control Panel then take a look into ""C:\Windows\Temp\NVIDIA Corporation\NV_Cache"" or ""C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\NVIDIA Corporation"" and delete the files restart and re-enable shader cache * Go into ""C:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota"" and delete the ""shaders_xx.vpk"" files then **verify the integrity of the game cache afterwards** or your dota will be visually buggy as hell. **Please re-enable shader cache in your NVCP/Crimson settings!** * Please note that I don't recommend doing this.  ## General stuff  * **Never run vsync on** in Dota2 (or any game which isn't DX12) **if you run windowed/borderless**. Windows' compositor acts as triple-buffered Vsync so you don't need to tick it ingame you'll have massive input lag else. * Double check that if running an iGPU (Laptops most Desktops even nowadays) that Dota runs on your dedicated GPU this can be done in your drivers control panel  ## New Settings in 7.0  * Disabling Grass and moving Trees in Video options yields around a 5% performance boost each sometimes more * If you still like grass but don't want to disable it you can use ""r_grass_quality 1"" from default of 2. This means there's less grass total. It goes up all the way to 5 if you're crazy for it.   ____  # **How to perform a benchmark**  1. Download the demo file I've made **a while ago** (because recording a demo doesn't work right now [please fix!]) [here](https://gigamove.rz.rwth-aachen.de/download/id/544Km2p5wGfkE3) link is valid for 14 days. 2. Paste the .dem file into your ""Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota"" folder 3. go in-game and run ""timedemo benchvulkan2.dem""  4. Now the demo should run. **It will look like low fps stuttery mess** this is **normal**. I can't make a new demo and I think something still is wrong with demos but at least we can benchmark reliably this way. 5. After you're done take a look into the ""Source2Bench.csv"" file in the same directory. The last line is the last run of the benchmark. 6. Extract the ""FPS"" and ""FPS Variability"" numbers from the last line [these ones](http://i.imgur.com/I5IBFH4.png). 7. Copy the schema below to fill in your **CPU (note if not stock clocks)** **GPU (note if not stock clocks)** **GPU DRIVER** **WINDOWS VERSION** (WINDOWS KEY + R type in ""winver"") **Renderer** **Resolution** **Details**. 8. Post the information in this thread.  _      copy paste this:     FPS | FPS Variance | CPU | GPU | GPU DRIVER | Windows Version | Renderer | Resolution | Details     ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----  so for example a standard run for me would look like:      Standard run:     108.7 | 15.4 | 5820k 4.2ghz | GTX 1080 2050mhz/5400mem | 376.33 | Windows 10 1607 | default (dx9ex) | 2560x1440 | All max except shadows on high no vsync     ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----  and that looks like:  108.7 | 15.4 | 5820k 4.2ghz | GTX 1080 2050mhz/5400mem | 376.33 | Windows 10 1607 | default (dx9ex) | 2560x1440 | All max except shadows on high no vsync ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----   Also please note that if you really have more time on your hands check out [/u/aveyo's post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5ixz4w/performance_issue_mega_thread/dbbx1ur/) to generate a vprof log this will give a better idea which sub routines are responsible for which cpu/gpu times among other things.  Like /u/moartuba pointed out this won't help with specific deep analysis at all but is meant as a crowd-sourced test to see possible outlier configurations which Valve themselves could then take a closer look at.  ____  # **Benchmarks**  ____  **Uuuhm we're over the 40k character limit so I'm going to paste everything into this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17a7PySOk9WBC40VERJ0FapuqsKOB77Fl_pJsFpKDXUE/edit?usp=sharing) for now**   /u/ImNotABotFam made this [very neat graph](http://i.imgur.com/9QJ0bMU.png) indicating which renderers work best with which GPU.

Refresher Mana Cost being 375 is not justified with every hero having 20 Intelligence at Level 25,self.DotA2,It's all in the Title here are some stats for Heroes with no Inteligence or Manapool increasing items attempting refresh combos at 25.  Faceless Void = 602 mana 300 for chrono 302 remaining. **63 mana required for Refresh**  Magnus  = 746 mana 300RP +375 Refresh = 81 remaining not enough for second RP. (1 Mana left if we include skewer) **219 Mana needed for second Reverse Polarity**  Tidehunter - 722 Mana (325 Ravage + 375 Refresh) 22 mana Remaining **303 mana required for second Ravage**  Zeus = 1058 Mana 450 TGW +375 Refresh = 233 mana remaining **217 Mana required for second Thundergod's Wrath**  I hope you are seeing a pattern here; sure this is only calculations involving Level 25 heroes with nothing but a refresher and is completely ignoring the fact that you can buy Int items but in actual games there are still regular abilities and item costs to account for. You aren't going to be sitting on high ground waiting for the enemy to allow you to pull off your combo you are going to be throwing out spells to stop the enemy advance before even thinking about your double ult combo that you may or may not have the mana to pull off.  It seems that the only heroes that reasonably buy Refresher and not ditch it in their inventory after use are Intelligence based heroes who WANT to be buying items to increase their mana pool such as Invoker Enigma and Outworld Devourer.  **Every single hero in the game has lost 200 mana coming from 6.88 to 7.00 and most of them can no longer do refresher combos without significant Manapool investment**  Refresher needs to have its Manacost lowered or have extra mana or Intelligence as part of it's components.,discussion

It goes against PGL and Valve for their selection of the panel. You got 3 analytical people who just stare at Day9 when he asks an open ended question and he has to be more direct with his questions to get something out of them. If you had someone like a Pyrion or Cap or KOTLguy someone whose talents extend outside of analysis they would jump in and help.

I'm Sad.,self.DotA2,"Not because 2GD is gone. Not because the majors has been a shitshow. Not because the drama has taken over.  I'm sad because Dota 2 is being driven away from it's community and into the mainstream. If it works and dota blows up we can say goodbye to 2GD OD will probably have to control himself Slacks will be in a grave marked ""Here Lies Community Driven Content"". If it doesn't... well I feel like valve will probably keep pushing for mainstream publicity for a long time getting stricter and stricter trying to make Dota into a sport rather than an esport.  I don't think esports will be accepted by the mainstream media for a long time. It's simply too complicated and very hard for someone to watch casually.  People like 2GD appeal to the target audience - teenagers and young adults watching online. Valve are trying to turn dota into a digestible sports show like everything on ESPN where the target audience is predominantly middle aged men and I don't think it's going to work.  How can you see Dota fitting in to the public domain?  EDIT: Jesus guys I'm not seeing a psychiatrist over this. In the perspective of the dota scene I'm sad to see it change.  Also I'm not suggesting everyones getting fired and we're never having a joke on air again but just remember back to the days where Bruno and 2GD would throw insults at everyone and talk about whatever they want - those days were good.

Dear Valve! Can you pls remove the daily hero bonuses?,self.DotA2,(Edit: Many ppl dont seem to know this: If you **pick** a bonus hero you get a free mango. This is not about randoming.)  At least **don't** give the heroes a **ingame Advantage.**  If you want to raise the variety of picks you can do something else maybe:  *higher chance of an item drop *free item/ chest if you win 10 bonus heroes at 10 days *bonus hero medal in the profile for 10 30 50 100 bonus hero wins.  but pls move away from actual ingame advantage! thank you! ,discussion

Hit 5k by spamming Chen. My thoughts on ranked matchmaking and the greatest hero in Dota,self.DotA2,"[The proof](http://i.imgur.com/O6yyoma.png)  I've got a lot I want to talk about but since most of you will never pick Chen and wont play with one in over 100 games I'll start with my thoughts on grinding MMR and ranked match making as a whole.  Basically you kids are too mad. Way too mad. I play the vast majority of my dota matches with IRL friends so it took me a long time to even calibrate a ranked MMR. I think I calibrated at 3.9K so I've only had to grind about a thousand mmr to hit 5k. Not really that long of a journey. But on my way I lost a lot of games due to intentional feeders.  Now I spam a lot of Chen. With almost a thousand games of Chen played I'm personally very confident in my ability to play him well. However I think the real improvement in my MMR is reflecting an attempt to be a better teammate.  I think when I hit about 4.3k an insane number of my losses were due to like minute 1 feeders. The guys who said ""mid or feed"" and meant it. Like 10% of my losses had to have been due to shit like that and that's totally unacceptable. It actually bummed me out and I quit playing with ranked all together.  A long time ago maybe in a psychology class or something I was introduced to the concept of emotional strength. I vaguely remember it coming up in a discussion of child development but I honestly didnt understand it. What does it mean to be emotionally strong? I wont ever know what it meant in the context of that class but Dota has me thinking about emotional strength a lot lately. I define emotional strength as **how much mental pressure you can be put under before you break.** For a lot of players maybe some readers the answer is that its simply not much. If you play ranked you understand exactly what I'm talking about.  I'm not sure why these players have such a hard time but I can understand it. Some people will tell you never to be frustrated when things go poorly or you lose but in my opinion frustration is a part of caring about the game. In turn caring is a part of getting good and getting better. How you manifest this frustration is a measure of strength.  The players who choose to lash out at their own team lack strength. You may not like your teammates but they are your only ones and they almost always want to win too. Instead emotionally weak players often are quick to flame their teammates for their mistakes. **Their criticisms are completely deconstructive.**   If you lose dota games often (and we all lose roughly half of them don't lie) you probably recognize the pattern. First everyone is cheery. Then everyone is quiet (or worse flaming each other). Finally your throne is dead. I aimed to break this cycle by communicating better and improving my teams relationships.  Let me be clear: **Forming a cohesive working team with 4 random strangers is hard but it is a skill you can leverage to win games.** If you have never put any effort into being a better teammate you have left MMR on the table. It's as simple as improving at last hitting. It's a fundamental aspect of Dota.  Some tips:  * Do not flame your teammates. Actually actively defend teammates who are being flamed.   Toxic players often will flame their teammates. Step in and explain to these players that its okay to make mistakes and that everyone does it even the best. Explain that this player most likely did not intend to make this mistake and certainly will try not to in the future.   * Give *constructive** criticism  Constructive criticism should almost go like this. First ask your teammate why they made a decision. After listening provide your alternative view point. Be prepared to learn something from their explanation. Maybe your criticism is totally unnecessary. If you do criticize explain why offer an alternative and be prepared for your teammate to ignore it. If they ignore your advice try to win anyway. Remember that ultimately each player on the team is making a decision *they* think is most likely to win. Respect that.  ""Hey Legion why are you building BKB?""  ""Bane keeps stunning me.""  ""Bane ult goes through BKB so that's not going to work. Maybe you should switch to a Desolator""  * Be optimistic. See teammates as potential friends not game ruiners.  * Don't queue up if you arent emotionally in a place to queue  After a rough loss I'd just go do something else. I am positive it improved my win rate and improved the lives of the people I would have otherwise played with.  * Communicate a plan with your team  As a chen player I'd often get into some pretty sticky late game situations. I have definitely won games I had no right winning because my team was together on *something.* I've found that your plan doesnt even need to be very good so long as everyone is a single mind on the subject.  * Accept that you will lose  Losing is as much a part of Dota as winning. If you honestly think you are going to win every game you play from now on I want what you're smoking. Instead  * Win or lose ask yourself how you could have played better.  I end each of my games by evaluating myself and coming up with one thing I could improve on. You dont have to watch a replay. It could be as simple as ""I should have ganked mid.""  **TL;DR** I think too many players focus on individual player skill and not on the social skills required to excel at dota. Focus on being a better teammate and you will see your MMR improve.  **The good part: A Snith Wanabee's Thoughts on Chen:**  After about 1000 games played as Chen I'd like to think I know what I'm doing. I'm on the dotabuff top 100 for Chen players though my teammates in ranked have informed me that this is a meaningless achievement. Regardless its extremely hard to put that many hours into the hero and learn nothing.  *A dog on a skateboard*  Imagine me an adult man crawling on top of a skateboard. Then slowly carefully I sit on it as it slides down a driveway. Would you be impressed? Of course not. Now imagine if instead of myself I was [A dog](http://www.skaterdog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Home2.png).   Chen is a dog on a skateboard. Its sort of amazing how differently your team treats you when you do the most mundane shit as Chen. Gank a hero? God. Farm arcane boots? God. Stack two camps? God. Kill a tower? God. Everything you do is made better because youre doing it while playing the dota hero equivalent of QWOP.  I spoke a lot earlier about working to be a better teammate and being good at Chen honestly does a lot for Morale. Techies spammers get free reports. Chen spammers get free commends. The double standard is real and I definitely won games by the simple fact that Chen is a huge morale boost for the team.  *Your team loves you*  Other than being able to roll over and play fetch Chen comes with two spells that your teammates will never get tired of. Hand of God and the [awkwardly named](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/60y7ap/bug_chens_lvl_15_talent_reduces_the_cooldown_of/) Test of Faith. Both of these spells allow you to make ridiculous saves and like all things Chen your teammates will greatly overestimate you for them.   *I'm sold how do I play Chen?*  Well start by playing a thousand games.  Okay okay but it will take some practice. After 1000 games of Chen I am still sort of shit at Micro. I play Chen like a hand. Chen is the thumb and the four creeps are the remaining fingers. My control groups are 1 for Chen 2 for Creeps only and 3 for everything. I have four wildkin tornadoes bound to 4 for whenever I have wildkins. If I collect an Alpha Wolf or a Kobold Taskmaster I just have them follow me.   One thing I do that I dont see any other Chens do is jungle offlane. I actually always jungle the offlane. I start by my teams secret shop and around 2min contest the enemy rune. Contesting the enemy bounty rune with Chen is great because teams only ever send one person to the rune and Chen is the king of early game.  I'm fairly confident that no hero can 1v1 a Chen at level 3 assuming Chen has two creeps. At least I havent lost a 1v1 yet. I'll keep you posted.  My personal creep tier list goes something like this.  **GOD:**  * Satyr  It gives ring of health in an aura. Wow. and the nuke reaches a ridiculous length and does way too much damage. With arcane boots you effectively have 100% uptime (its not quite that good but its close). Unlike all creeps its just plain better in multiples. I have won many games from finding 3-4 of these early on and just nuking my way into their base. Note that its range is similar to Lion's Earth Spike. Target the ground about half way to your target to maximize its range potential  **TOP:**  * Dark-Troll Summoner  Landing a net is extremely easy compared to landing a centaur stomp. Depending on the hero the net can be as good as stunning as well. Its also worth noting that centaurs are so slow and have such terrible stomp range that landing a stomp often requires a net.  * Centaur  Ah the classic. Many players wrongly assume Centaurs are the god tier best creep but theyre not. If you see a chen run at you with centaurs I recommend walking away. Its almost impossible to stomp a hero who is walking directly away from the centaur. Stomp has an extremely short range and the centaurs themselves are quire slow. Other slows/ranged stuns are usually required to land a stun.  **MID:**  * Hellbear Smasher  They give a relevant aura and deal good damage in a fight. Otherwise not much to say. Suffer from the same range issues as centaurs  * Wildkin  Extremely good as one of the first few creeps you find. They take down stacked camps/the enemy mid laner about as well as any creep you could hope for. The 3 armor aura is also great for pushing  * Alpha Wolf  Significantly better late game than early game but its one of the best auras you can have. Late game centaurs explode to randomly shot AoEs in team fights. Creeps that provide Auras are much more powerful at this stage.  **PLAYABLE:**  * Frost Ogre  Frost armor is great. The creep otherwise is not.  * Kobold Taskmaster  Never your favorite pickup but the speed aura is extremely relevant for getting your centaurs and smashers in range. And everyone else on your team.   * Mud Golem  Best used for level one kill strats but has some midgame potential. At level one of Holy Persuasion you can command a mud golem and after Holy Persuasion goes off cooldown command any other creep. Because you have a 1 creep limit the Mud Golem will instantly die leaving you with two mini golems. You will maintain command of these golems which allows you to have 3 creeps at level 1. Spicy.  * Satyr Purgeguy  The purgeguy is playable. He's a lot better with helm of the dominator because he has a short cast range and is quite slow. Helm gives him movement speed to make up for that. I end up dominating him a lot less anymore now that Omniknight repel cant be purged.  *Dirty Tips*  Jungle camps cannot spawn the same creep twice. The camp that gave you a centaur one spawn will not give you a centaur the next spawn. If the camp fails to spawn for some reason (like it was blocked) the next spawn can still not be a centaur.  Holy Persuasion trumps all other forms of creep control. Enchantress will be able to take a persuaded creep but if you persuade it back the next time enchantress tries to enchant the creep it will simply reset the duration. She will not re-gain control.  The same is true for Helm of the Dominator. If Naix gains control of a creep and you command it Naix will not be able to gain control again (and will probably be in your well. Test of Faith him back!).   The Troll's net goes through Magic immunity and interrupts channels. Juggernaut is a very popular hero and often tries to spin to get away from fights. Nets make him very sad. Storm Spirit cannot ult and AM cannot blink while netted.  *A final note: Fighting Chen*  Pls sirs stop running into my creeps. Pls.  Actually here let me math it out for you. If you see a solo Chen running around in your jungle count his creeps and add one to that number (Creeps + 1 = X). Then ask yourself ""Would I fight an X stacked heavy camp?"" If the answer is no I ask you why would you fight a camp that big with the brains of a real player behind it? I dont know either but the number of lvl 1 pudges I've had sit on top of me rotting is way too high at this point. The number of lvl 2 pudges is even higher. I understand you dont see a lot of chen but I dont think many level two pudges would mess with a hellbear camp. Why would they mess with a hellbear camp that I literally have mind controlled? Food for thought.  For anyone who has made it this far thank you for reading my 5000 MMR shitpost. I hope it was informative. I cant wait to share my next one at 6k.",discussion
Valve just make a model rework contest already.,self.DotA2,EDIT2: when I suggested the community can vote I meant vote on the various hero model reworks submitted in the contest for a certain hero which is known to have ugly textures like Slardar or maybe Valve can choose one. I wasn't suggesting the community votes on which hero gets a rework.  Ok so it's no secret the community wants some of the hero models reworked (myself included). Ugly bastards like Viper Jakiro and Slardar need immediate help because not even a mother could love those faces (it's been proven with Jakiro). So Valve since it seems you're unwilling/too busy to make model reworks yourselves why not turn it into a contest?  There's tons of talented modders out there who would kill for this opportunity. You could wrap this up in three weeks tops. Pick a hero and start a contest with three rounds. You can even make it a monthly thing so that for the next months you give us something. Viper Jakiro and Slardar -> 3 months with new stuff. Here's how the contest could play out:  * 1st week - Model rework submissions for the hero picked for rework that month: everyone can enter their model rework -> people vote for their favourite rework. * 2nd week - Semi-final: only a few models go forward -> authors fine tune them -> people vote again. * 3rd week - Final: two models remain -> last minute changes -> community votes on final model  Valve if you're concerned about your say in this then you could be a model adviser for the finalists or something like that or even have a say in the vote as well. That way we can make sure the model is as high-quality as possible both creatively and technically and that everyone is pleased.   So Valve what's it going to be?  EDIT: formatting  EDIT3: ok to avoid even more confusion I have to say that I'm not suggesting model changes similar to the legion commander change from dota 1 to dota 2. So I'm not saying that for example Slardar should be changed from a fish worm into an unicorn or whatever. I'm saying his texture is ugly and low-res and needs updated. It could turn out that the winning Slardar model rework is not very different from the current one in terms of shapes and idea but instead just much much better looking.,discussion
Liquid.gh - Now officially indisputable - absolute GOD among gods.,self.DotA2,There have been so many stand out performances from so many players this TI countless next to next-next-level plays.   But for me gh undoubtedly takes the cake. He's really come into his own lately and is consistently performing on a level that reminds me of a jerax lil or zfreek (of course among many others just a few favorites of mine) just cruising on a signature hero constantly pulling off the seemingly impossible.   Just so fun to watch hope to see him in the scene for many years to come.  Edit: Congrats to all of team Liquid! Well deserved hard fought victory!,discussion
Here's what I think everyone has ignored about the way Secret played at TI (With Pictures!),self.DotA2,I'm not a Secret fan or hater but as someone who has followed RTZ and EE over the past few years I felt that a lot of the praise/criticism regarding RTZ/EE and PLD/Puppey was a bit unfair. Don't get me wrong EE had some extremely questionable plays late game but I disagree those plays were a primary reason they lost. Likewise despite amazing late game play PLD had an extremely low-impact early game.  **While I don't think anyone will disagree with the fact Secret struggled early most of the discussion surrounding their loss has been around their late game so I put together a timeline with gifs to illustrate just how bad their early game was.**  ## Mid lane first blood > **0:37** Kunkka reveals the 2v1 midlane by torrenting RTZ. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/OfficialGraciousCockerspaniel)  > **0:52** RTZ gets torrented a second time. Surely a support will rotate for the incoming gank.  > **1:12** Jugg dives Tier 1 and kills RTZ for first blood and fast bottle. RIP  While RTZ could have positioned a bit more defensively giving him a 2v1 lane as an Alchemist and expecting to win seems a bit optimistic. PLD doesn't rotate mid until 4 minutes when he stacks the mid hard camp for RTZ. Despite SD being able to stack multiple camps in the first 10 minutes he only stacks twice.  ## PLD single pulls EE's lane twice > **1:35** PLD misses his double pull after only denying one creep. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/FirsthandVagueIslandcanary)  > **2:30** PLD misses his second double pull with no denies. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/DeficientImportantCrocodileskink)  Even though its hard to say exactly how much of an impact those two waves of creep xp made it definitely didn't help.  PLD essentially gets nothing done for the first few minutes when he could have double stacked and cleared camps with RTZ mid. This is just my opinion but mechanically speaking a support playing at main stage missing a double pull twice is just as bad as a carry not hitting his BKB. ## >We Need Wards! > **3:00** No one notices Kunkka drop off game winning obs ward in Radiant secret shop area despite being under radiant vision for a full 10 seconds. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/WellwornCalmAfricanmolesnake)  > **3:37** Puppey spots Kunkka leaving but fails to guess where he warded. Doesn't seem to warn Bulba of incoming gank. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/UntidyWealthyCrossbill)  > **3:42** Bulba finally backs top but its way too late.  > **3:50** Puppey overextends feeding a double kill to LGD as he chases Kunkka. If he just backs he gets level 3 from the incoming wave or potentially secures  the 4:00 DD rune top. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/EthicalSevereAxolotl)  This pretty much sets the tone for rest of the game. That single secret shop ward allowed LGD to secure multiple ganks and avoid all of Secret's early game rotations. They had two chances to spot it and missed them both.  Watching Puppey go tunnel vision on Kunkka felt like I was watching a clip of myself and Bulba taking almost 5 full seconds before turning around actually hurts to watch.  ## >We Need Wards!!!!!!!!11 > **4:00** PLD stacks his first and only jungle camp for RTZ's Alchemist.   >**5:00** Radiant wards have all expired and its night time. Jugg farms mid and runs into radiant jungle.  >**5:05** PLD pings where Jugg is headed and Puppey dies a few seconds later to Omnislash. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/ChiefQualifiedColt)  >**6:16** Bulba gets ganked by hasted Jugg farming the offlane hard camp. Secret still oblivious to dire observer ward.  >**8:30** Jugg gets an Invis which he uses to solo kill Puppey again.  This sums up Secret's early game ward situation in a nutshell. Secret supports lost the ward game to LGD hard. Jugg was able to efficiently gank freely and RTZ was forced to farm super defensively. End result? The only camp Alch feels safe farming is their mid hard camp and and Secret get ganked repeatedly.  ## 9k ~~Miracle~~ Maybe Juggernaut >**8:49** Jugg escapes a potentially game changing death while Secret further lose their spaghetti. PLD doesn't get his shadow poison stacks off before Blade Fury and wishes he had a point in soul catcher. Bulba drops a boar that attacks twice over using axes and Dota pathing makes him sad. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/CloudyReliableBeaver)  While I admit PLD getting his stacks off before Blade Fury wouldn't have secured the kill by itself its one of many points in the game where individuals on Secret got outplayed in a potentially game changing moment. For example Secret could have positioned better for more autoattacks after Disruption or used illusions to bodyblock Jugg after BM roar.   ## Tactical Feed >**11:09** Puppey gets caught out of position casting Wave of Terror. At this point all I can hope is that these are tactical feeds to burn enemy mana and get higher kill streak gold later on. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/SkeletalAshamedAurochs)  >**11:18** WW casually wards radiant jungle ward spot under Radiant observer vision. No one notices. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/RapidDesertedBasilisk)  They were so far behind at that point the death probably didn't matter. Still its another example of questionable positioning and Secret losing the ward game.  ## Even Pros Experience The Trench >**12:30** Secret pushes their first tower top. Bulba feeds his Hawk to tower getting distracted along with Secret supports chasing a WW hiding in the trees. Meanwhile 3 LGD heroes rotate completely unscouted without any Secret wards.  [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/FlamboyantUnevenAmericanwirehair)  A popular opinion is that that Secrets supports played well while their cores were underwhelming. **After rewatching the game PLD/Puppey had as much a hand in Secret's loss as Bulba Artour and EE.** The play was so bad that if you changed the player names had GrandGrant cast the game and told me it was NEL I still wouldn't believe you.  EDIT: Fixed Juggernaut spell names. ,discussion

ArtStyle is abusing Stream viewership to report steam accounts.,self.DotA2,Just tuned in to the http://www.twitch.tv/immunepwnz channel. Watched the game for 5 minutes. @immunepwnz is playing party mmr with ArtStyle. Their team was not doing well and ArtStyle got really mad for Zeus not ultying when he requested (a couple of times). So he asks the streamer if he can ask the viewers to report Zeus' steam (around 2.9k viewers at the time). Immunepwnz says sure this cancerous Zeus needs to be cured and proceeds to spam the link asking to report Zeus (who was just underperforming a little bit). Calling them out on stream chat got me perma-banned almost instantly.  Edit: they actually won that game as well. So in fact Zeus didn't even ruin game hard enough for them to lose.,discussion
Why ESL is still delusional and destructive,self.DotA2,"*All the quotes in here are copypasted straight from the AMA so feel free to ctrl+f them if you want.*  [Recently ESL VP Ulrich Schulze opened up an AMA on this subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7sw0w5/i_am_ulrich_schulze_here_to_answer_your_questions/) In the field of video games and in this day and age AMA's are the ultimate PR move. They're basically a consumer venting session that encourages you to be more polite and to sugarcoat your complaints. I can't blame ESL for finally busting out a real PR move but a quick look at some of the content and answers of that AMA will show that Ulrich and ESL are maintaining their disrespectful and delusional attitude.  Let's begin with Ulrich's introduction. He claims to be apologizing for not ""hitting the right tone"" explaining that the last two days were a ""frustrating situation"" for him and ESL. Some tweets have been deleted and some people have been unblocked--and I don't want to conflate the abusive and disrespectful tweets by other Dota personalities with Ulrich--but any tweets about the poor quality of the stream or streaming platform were an invitation to be flamed and blocked or met with a condescending remark about how the ""real world"" works (gamers love hearing that by the way). Some residual effects of this can be seen on [Ulrich's Twitter](https://twitter.com/theflyingdj) notably the desperate attempt to clean up the aftermath of this.  Frankly if you're a grown adult who's supposedly been working in esports for ""15 years"" **it is unacceptable to be handling your frustrations by throwing a tantrum on Twitter.** You're Senior VP of an important player in the esports ecosystem and your response to a business decision not working out how you like is to insult belittle and demean your fans? (More on that in a second). Far from ""hitting the right tone"" you willingly increased the toxicity of the discourse surrounding your own event because...why? Because you made a bad product? Unacceptable response unacceptable apology. Plain and simple.  But the real meat of this lies in the AMA responses so let's move on from what we already knew was a huge mistake by ESL.  First the delusion. In response to a question about why ESL made a deal with Facebook over any other platform Ulrich answers: **""We believe in the long term value of this because Facebook is a platform which reaches more users than any other platform.""** To be clear this is referring to users that are not already engaged in esports AKA the other hundreds of millions of users that use Facebook for all sorts of random stuff. Here the delusion becomes pretty clear. **What was ESL's plan to engage any of those other users who do not care about esports? If by Ulrich's own admittance Facebook is not prepared to stream esports events how could streaming there be any more accessible than a quick redirect to Twitch or YouTube? Why was there literally ZERO intuitive ways to find the stream via Facebook if that's the audience you're trying to engage?** ESL allegedly believes Facebook's huge userbase provides an opportunity for increased viewership yet they did **nothing** to engage Facebook users who are not yet fans and actively **discouraged** pre-existing fans from visiting Facebook to watch the stream. It is also worth mentioning that the literal barriers to watching the Facebook stream are monumental compared to Twitch or YouTube. Mobile options are broken or nonexistent. Secondary language streams were nonexistent. Having to have a Facebook account to chat or sometimes even view the stream is yet another barrier to entry. If ESL truly believes Facebook and their actions in promoting this event could ever possibly lead to increased viewership they are simply **delusional**.  Secondly Ulrich promptly began lying and backtracking within his own AMA. In response to one question he clearly states: **""Facebook numbers are not in yet (the number you see does not count users who are not logged in) so have to wait for that""**. However when another user asks: ""Can you confirm that the number shown on Stream is not the actual viewer number as it doesn't account for users that aren't logged in and viewers from embedded streams?"" Ulrich replies: **""I don't know exactly will find out.""** So which is it? Does the display viewership number match the actual viewership number or not? This isn't too important of a point but it **continues the trend of ESL making unclear intentionally vague or flat-out incorrect statements about their Facebook broadcast agreement.**  Oh remember when I said that the only way Facebook could reach more users than Twitch and YouTube would be if Ulrich was including **people who don't already engage in esports**? Apparently that isn't ESL's goal. Ulrich states: **""I don't think we should ever aim to convert people who have never played Dota or don't know esports exist.""** Now this seems like a pretty horrible mindset for someone who has **""always had [esport's] further growth and success in mind""** but it also leaves me wondering WHO exactly ESL thinks they are reaching by streaming on Facebook. It's not Dota and esports fans but it's not people who aren't Dota and esports fans? Huh? Ulrich goes on mention that 4.5 million people ""like"" Dota 2 on Facebook and that he believes they could all be potential watchers of a stream. I agree but then I [look at ESL's unique Twitch channel views](https://socialblade.com/twitch/user/esl_dota2). This one ESL channel has amassed over 36 MILLION unique viewers--a bit more than 4.5 million. I won't even bother accounting for like bots dead Facebook accounts the fact that clicking a like button is an entirely different statement than being a ""fan"" of something etc. etc. The fact of the matter is that there **was never a specific viewership population ESL genuinely thought would watch on Facebook over Twitch or YouTube.**  If you want any further proof of that just look at how Ulrich repeatedly handles criticism of the terrible Facebook streaming platform and ESL's complete lack of consideration of their fanbase. I'll provide an image this time since I think the exchange speaks for itself and you can find a dozen variations on this awful response throughout the thread: [IMAGE](https://i.imgur.com/1NwkkG4.png)  Now I could continue ragging on ESL's delusions and total lack of foresight (intentional or unintentional) all day but the real meat of the matter is their **total disrespect to their fans and the community that allows them to exist.**  The aforementioned Twitter tantrums by Ulrich and other Dota personalities are really evidence enough that those who have ""achieved the esports dream"" don't give a damn about the community's opinions and that any criticism of them or their actions will be met with childish whining (ironic isn't it?). However what really matters is the **supremely anti-consumer pro-corporate attitude ESL and others have demonstrated throughout this fiasco.**  Here's the most damning quote from Ulrich himself: **""You are a consumer but at the same time there is not a direct revenue stream to us from you as a viewer. That means we look at sponsorship potential broadcast revenue tickets etc. and based on that make a decision. That means it is not necessarily always the easiest for the viewer i.e. platforms might change or formats. Unfortunately that is just the reality of esports right now.""**  To translate: we have no plans to consider the fact that behind a broadcast contract or viewership number there exist REAL PEOPLE who have the power to make decisions about the content they consume. **ESL's expectation is that we consume whatever they produce and then kiss their boots after.** The raw numbers of sponsorship and broadcast contracts are the only things that mean anything to ESL and the only things that ever will. ESL does not care about your counterargument that those sponsorship only exist because **you tune in to watch**. ESL assumes and demands that you will tune in regardless of how they wrong or offend you. That's the ""reality of esports"" they have in mind. One where the fans are mindless consumers that amount to nothing but view numbers that **can be manipulated according to their business projections and profit margins.** One where the failures of a product are not the fault of the producers for not producing well but of the consumers for not consuming what was laid out before them.  If you are a hollow shell that exists only to please your corporate master maybe that kind of reality appeals to you. But I believe most of us value the ability to express our opinions to the organizations we support and expect that a **producer's number one goal will always be to make a product that consumers are willing to consume.** They key word here is **willing** not forced. The absurd DMCA strikes against numerous Twitch accounts (including in languages ESL was not offering) just go to show that ESL wishes for a world where we are forced to consume whatever they produce. We as consumers have been **undervalued disrespected and taken for granted.**  There are endless more contradictions (in some responses Ulrich claims the have specific agreements with Valve in others he claims they have just been interpreting Valve's ""vague"" blog post) and lies but I believe I've made my point. If you don't care about the way ESL has treated its fans and do not care about your options or rights as a consumer I guess you can go on supporting ESL. But if you want **the ability to choose what you watch** or expect **professionalism and decency** from the companies YOU allow to exist then do not forget the **lies disrespect and arrogance** of ESL in this situation.  EDIT: Replaced some words in the penultimate paragraph for the sake of my BDSM buddies.",discussion
can someone please teach me how to win against phantom assassin,self.DotA2,hello  every game i ban phantom assassin and the ban does not work. the other team then first picks phantom assassin. I try to lane against phantom assassin but she spams me with her dagger for half of my hp for every throw. The dagger costs her 5% of her mana on each throw. If she gets a kill she is level 6 and she instakills me. If she kills 2 people in the game she gets a desolator and can solo rosh and the entirety of my team. If she is able to take any objectives get any kills or is not killed at least 10 times in 7 minutes she gets a bkb and instakills my entire team while we run in terror for 10 seconds. I try to save up my money for the 5200 gold necessary to right click her but i have a trouble saving my money when she chases me from my tier 1 into my fountain and kills me while im healing in the fountain cause it misses her. I know that i can buy diffusal blade for 3200 gold so that i can try to right click her for 4 seconds but she just blinks away with her blink ability which has a cooldown of 2 seconds.  I would like to enjoy dota 2 please teach me how to beat phantom assassin   thank u,discussion

No hate but if you had to hire a group stage host who is going to be on camera for less than an hour why not hire Kotlguy who has been loyal to the community instead of Machine,self.DotA2,I am sure Kotlguy is quite sad about it aswell work hard the whole year and even if valve doesn't want to hire you for the main event you aren't even hired as a group stage host which you can do easily.

What does a hero trully needs ? [in 7.00],self.DotA2,"Hey guys before the wall of text i would like to thank synderen for inspiring this. Since 7.00 launched and the new experience changes were introduced i was keen on understanding what type of hero was going to be stronger. At first i thought that heroes like lina tusk huskar  lion that pretty much max their magic damage output (without ults) at around lvl 9-10 would be super op .   [Synderen's axe game](https://www.twitch.tv/synderen/v/108968749) that starts at around 3.22.00 opened my eyes on why heroes like slark weaver and ember got huge winrate increases this patch while heroes like lina and tusk have somewhat the same winrate (or worst).  If you look at the [xp chart comparison](https://imgur.com/a/QhDGW#sRjCx0g) you can see that there's a way bigger gap around the lvl 11~16 than lvl 8~9  (percentage-wise). If you watch 4 minutes of the Synderen game you can understand why this matters so much (start at 17.30 and go until 21.30) .  They were pretty much in control of the game until a fight starts at 18.00.   Slark is lvl 14 at this point (in 6.88 he would be lvl 12 and his skill build would be probably 4-4-2-2) . He has the same skill build this game but with the added benefit of having extra 15 dmg from his talent and an extra point on essence shift . They lose that fight (with essence shift stacks that last 1 minute) slark gets lvl 15 and with all that agi (that lasts a lot) he can take the tower and farm really fast guaranteeing slark pretty much a 20 mins silver edge + echo saber. Slark has decent lvl 15 talents but what makes him go out of control in most games is the fact that you can skip them to get lvl 4 essence shift at lvl 15 [skill build for that game](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2863065805/builds) with the same ammount of experience you would be lvl 13 (1 min essence shfits) and in the last patch it would take a decent ammount of time to go from 13 to 14. (There's a HUGE difference between lvl 3 essence shift and lvl 4)  One minute later they fight again in the radiants secret shop and slark obliterates axe again. This time having essence shift stacks that last for 2 minutes guaranteeing another pickoff on him 1 minute later even though synd is still pretty tanky. What's my point here ?   My point is that if you exclude the heroes with tons of bufs in this patch ( lycan visage treant) you will see that a lot of the heroes that got winrate increases this patch have only or mostly ofensive abilities.   **Examples: Undying slark weaver ember troll phoenixtinker**   [Link for a spreadsheet i made](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TKU6oH3aIY3U172TG6GFtyW3AX__Kzs6wDCtTtryWA4/edit?usp=sharing) I'm using Dotamax as a source [6.88](http://dotamax.com/hero/rate/?time=v688&ladder=y&skill=vh) [7.00](http://dotamax.com/hero/rate/?time=v700&ladder=y&skill=vh).   Being able to have all your 3 skills at max level and your ult lvl 2 earlier than before helps these heroes achieve a comparable stronger state compared to last patch and thus they snowball. Of course there are exceptions and even though i can give my two cents on why they are happening my point with this post was never pinpointing one single factor that changed the overal winrate of all heroes so much stuff changed in this patch that it is probably imposible to do so:  Lina has only ofensive abilities and lost winrate. I feel like she is terrible against monkey king (which has hugh mungus pick rate right now) she is also very bad against a lot of popular heroes: mirana pa sniper weaverriki drow.  If you check the spreadsheet though you'll see that tons of heroes with at least one (only)defensive (purification is both) or non-ofensive spells are stale in winrate or lost winrate.     **EDIT1: Yes i am D2BOWIE**   EDIT2: I know a lot of people are arguing about ""selection bias"" and everything in life is subjective but i'll try to reitarete my point:  1. Tusk has a slow. it does not deal damage. I know you can use slows ofensively and maybe that's my bad but i am mainly talking about damage when i refeer to ""mostly ofensive heroes"".    **Mostly ofensive heroes > Heroes that can deal damage with every skill they have. (crits passives like essence shift in my opinnion allow that)**   **Mostly defensive heroes or not all ofensive heroes > Heroes that can not deal damage with every skill they have. (cm aura tusk slow warcry  healing ward do not).**  EDIT3: The biggest difference between a hero in this patch and the last patch is that lvl 15 scenario where you max your 3 basic skills way earlier than it would happen in 6.88 . So it doesn't matter if weaver has ult because she would have lvl 2 ult at that stage of the game. **I am mainly looking at the 3 normal abilities from heroes.**  EDIT4: I have spellcheck (in portuguese though since i am from Brazil). I am sorry if my writing is not up to par to the usual analytical reddit post. I do try to check some words that  but english is not my first language.",discussion

Why is Wall of Replica still Dark Seer's ult?,self.DotA2,Just looking at its stats and comparing to the next closest ability Terrorblade's Reflection Wall of Replica is a joke. It's illusions take 400% damage so they die instantly to almost any AoE while the illusions created by Reflection are untargetable have free pathing and will pretty much torment you until they disappear.  Wall illusions also deal 90% damage at level 3 while TB's basic ability which is easier to set up and land deal 100% damage.  Oh but the bullshit is not over yet cuz when we get into mana costs and cooldowns Dark Seer has to spend 125/250/375 mana and put his ability on a 100 second cooldown while terrorblade laughs at the measly 50 mana he spent and waits just 16 seconds to cast it again (6 seconds if he goes for the talent cuz the ability wasn't good enough)  At least Dark Seer's slow is stronger at 75%... Oh wait even at its best it only lasts 1 second while terrorblade slows you for a third of that but for 5.5 times as long but wait cuz if you went for the cooldown talent that 25% slow only has a 0.5 second window before TB can reapply it   The only thing Wall of Replica has over Reflection is being able to control the illusions and since they last 45 seconds you might be able to do something with them like pushing a tower but that's assuming they didn't die instantly to a random AoE during the fight or that people even went through it at some point something terrorblade doesn't worry about  Tl;dr wall of text about wall of replica,discussion
Could pro-players please stop being dicks in pub games and therefore help creat a better community?,self.DotA2,"I'm coming from a SC2 background where pro-player behave very friendly in games and i think that is a huge part of why the community is friendly and awesome. Meanwhile I read on a daily basis about how rtz is flaming in pubs or today how sumail is feeding on purpose for whatever reason and then people crying that the community is so toxic. Of course it is toxic when such players who are supposed to be community idols behave like this. Schouldn't they behave in the best possible way instead of making people believe that such behaviour is acceptable? I can't believe that their organisations and sponsors are okay with a behaviour like that as well... It's sad.  Edit:  I never said I want to compare SC2 to Dota2 I just meant to give an example of a community where I think the pros had a big influence in how people treat each other (and who ever got 6 pooled or canon rushed knows how angry you actually can get in a single player game yet most people just leave the game and don't flame).  Don't misunderstand me I'm not saying pro-players aren't allowed to rage; I'd never complain about them saying on stream s/t like 'OMG this dude sucks' etc. I mean we shouldn't be okay with them feeding like stupid or telling someone else to die or anything along those lines; I think there is a huge difference.  Edit2: I'm really not here to discuss whether or not these pro-players should be role models (obviously I don't think they should) but they are and that's the problem.   Edit3: Everyone quoting Charles Barkley: ""I am not a role model. Just because I dunk a basketball doesn't mean I should raise your kids.""  If said Barkley would play a public game everyone would watch on TV and he'd start scoring for the other team you guys really think people would be okay with that?  Last Edit: Just because someone once made a commercial that he is not a role model etc. doesn't mean he is right with that...  Otherwise every musician actor or otherwise famous person could easily have the same point of view. They don't get paid to be a role model they get paid to act perform songs etc. Yet they are role models whether they like it or not and sometimes you have to accept your responsibility in a community if you like it or not.",discussion

6.84 has now lasted as long as 6.83. But can we all agree this patch has no where been as bad as that was,self.DotA2,"6.83 was from December - April and 6.84 from April - September (both equally 5 months). And although it's becoming quite stale to see Leshracs and Storms and Bloodseekers in every other game it is no where near to being as annoying as 6.83. Maybe the addition of support friendly items and the toning down of the comeback mechanics has resulted in this.  But I think we can all agree 6.83 was one of the worst patches in Dota history (yes even worse than the Deathball of 6.81 or the spirit breaker and huskar of 6.78). The ""mask of madness"" era of every hero moving at 522 ms can seriously go to Dota hell",discussion

Mirana's arrows now hit catapults actually a somewhat significant nerf.,self.DotA2,Catapult and hero attack range are often pretty similar.  Being able to stand next to a catapult while sieging a tower is a pretty big buff against mirana.    Normally the catapults help visually disguise the arrow and may make a player forget there is NOT a buffer between them and the arrow as the rest of the creeps move on past.   I often found that an arrow is more likely to not be dodged if a catapult is sitting in the path of the arrow. Now players are 100% safe there  and can abuse this to remove just about all likely arrow pathways so they can focus on the tower more easily.   You might think that its worthwhile to hit the cart to squash most of the tower damage but the tradeoff is really negative if you could have otherwise hit the player instead. In a situation where there is only creep pressure maybe sure however using arrow on catapults isn't really a good use of mana early game. I see this very rarely coming into play in a positively beneficial or necessary manner.   In my mind the extra obstacle to her arrow landing is a big enough nerf to counter the buffs she got this patch.   ,discussion

PSA: It is not Mid's job to gank your lane,self.DotA2,I'm not sure if this is a relic from an old meta or something but you did not lose the game because mid didn't gank before x time. Typically a hero goes mid for the gold and experience so why would they risk solo xp to *maybe* get a pickoff for 200 gold? If you get a haste rune as TA or an invis rune as Lina considering ganking the closest side lane! However it is ~~the supports job~~ typically more advantageous for supports to help mid win their lane not the other way around.  **Knowing when to rotate from mid into a push or teamfight is very important.** If there is pressure from the enemy on your towers or you could turn the tide of a fight then rotate! I'm sure people will flame mid for not ganking till the end of time but times they are a-changin'. Buy a smoke and gank the enemy Lina. You'll be happy you did.  edit: I'd like to clarify that I understand every game is different. I've played thousands of matches and I get that everything is circumstantial. Item builds change game to game and so do rotations. Do what's best for your team just don't blame them for every loss. ,discussion

New Winter Wyvern talent does more harm than good,self.DotA2,In 7.06 Winter Wyvern respawn talent on level 20 was changed to:   **+1s Cold Embrace Duration**  I think taking this talent is detrimental to your game impact. Level 20 on support is when late game fights start to happen so having a hero disabled for an extra second gives enemy more time to kill other heroes in a 4v5 fight or throw more magic damage spells.   Sure cold embrace can be used on a stunned teammate while he cannot act anyway but how many stuns last longer than 4 seconds? The only relevant one is mirana arrow so this extra second is again wasted. And I don't think this drawback is worth a pathetic 20+6%maxhp extra heal.  Instead if we go that route the talent should be:   **+25% cold embrace heal**   I'd bump that value to 35-40% since the other talent is 120gpm which is important to support  Edit: Another idea mentioned in the discussion: make cold embrace cancellable like Bane's nightmare (should not be tied to talent imo).   ------------------------------------  Also while we're at it 7.06 reworked many useless aghs but why not wyvern's? It is one of the least picked ones out there.,discussion

A reminder to those that hate the Reborn client right now,self.DotA2,The Source 1 client took over 4 years to get into the highly functional state it is (was) today.  For those of you that haven't been around since the First Blood update when Axe didn't have his manly mutton chops yet the armory back then simply called the backpack was terrible.  Manually moving every single item no filters literally no way to organize it.  But they made that shit great it took a *looooooong* time but it VASTLY improved the player's interface with their digital hats.  Reborn currently doesn't have many of the features Source 1 does but it also does not share many of the bugs Source 1 was eternally plagued with.  I don't think I've seen the full store page in over a year on account of it being zoomed in forever.  The UI was slower it took longer to load the compendium and player pages for example.  There aren't tons of unused 'features' cluttering up the Reborn client like Source 1 had (at least not yet) such as recruiting fantasy seasons professional team stuff that only 1% of the playerbase used after Team Ranked Matchmaking was removed.  Yes I could display my favorite hero and eight of my Desert Gale arms but people barely ever saw it save for my friends curious about my player stats.   Now I can actually showcase items and heroes that were impossible in the Source 1 client.  The overall UI for Reborn is cleaner easier to read and more fluid than Source 1.  Much like switching to a new operating system it might seem foreign and clunky at first but you'll find yourself pertaining towards your new OS and seeing the flaws in the previous.  Finally constructive criticism is really important right now such as the many threads stating that the Friends List should be on the frontpage.  This is a change which will drastically improve the user's experience and ease of access into inviting friends and queueing up for a match as well as seeing friend's games quickly on the go.  There are many small flaws in Reborn that need fixed up as well but those need to be addressed.  Making a thread because 'you don't like' something 1. Tells Valve nothing except general dissatisfaction about the thing you are pointing to and 2. Is not a priority and/or should not be changed because you disliked changing to the Reborn client.  Some of those tiles are to ensure new players have a point-of-interest on the main page some are to sell Dota hats so Dota can stay F2P (lmao compendium sales) to update players who barely check patch notes giving credit to the biggest Dota 2 tournament of the year so on and so forth.  We should currently be suggesting Quality-of-Life changes such as the fact that there is no way to directly suggest players in your party to download a Custom Game except for going straight to the workshop page copy + pasting it and waiting for everyone to resound an unenthusiastic 'ready' since there is no way to tell who and who doesn't have the file installed.  Same goes for the Essences and Eggs something that should have been done for years now but Valve should fix regardless if they're discarding the items.  Alright now come at me with downvotes or discussion I'm ready for you to pick this apart so we can start helping Valve make a better client.  EDIT: Valve pushed themselves into a corner (concerning the new patch and majors) and now need the player base to go on to Reborn so they can 100% concentrate on fixing Source 2 in quick fashion.  I'm not exactly happy about it either but we can't get the Source 1 client back anyways.  Constructive Criticism such as the Friend List or request for Open Mic back and bug reports are what we need right now not personal reasons for disliking the client guild chat or a complete redesign of the current UI; These posts offer no help to Valve and only help to circlejerk the subreddit.

My proposition for a Techies change coming from someone who doesn't love nor hate the hero: Make him a 7-7-7-4 hero like Invoker. No more stats upgrades only abilities with a better scaling.,self.DotA2,"I posted this as a comment in another techies thread but i was pretty late to it and i think not much people saw it and no one even commented on it. So i'd like to ask your opinions on this.      In my opinion(only 3K mmr but i've been playing this game for about 10 years) Techies cannot be a 4-4-4-3 hero anymore. He needs to be like Invoker. No stats upgrades only 4 abilities going 7-7-7-4 with a much better scaling. Make lvl 6 or 7 red mines be a truly deadly ability. Make lvl 6 Statis Trap be a reliable stun with a shorter preparation time and longer cast range. Make his ulti truly-invisible until the bomb is detonable(the hero doesn't turn in the direction he is placing it and the bomb doesn't appear in the air until it is on the ground and ready to explode). Allow techies to truly participate in a teamfight aside from simply suiciding.      I think that this change gives something extremely important to a techies player: the ability to chose what the hero do. Same way you can play a Quas-Wex and an Exort Invoker you can play a Bomb-placer techies and a more Teamfight Control-oriented techies.      Of course there would have to be some more changes regarding his atributes mostly since he will now lack the 20 points in each stat that you get from leveling atributes. Perhaps increasing his atribute gain to help make him more viable early game or maybe even attach atributes bonus to his abilities like Invoker has. For example a point in Mines gives him 1 Intelligence a point in Statis gives him 1 Agility a point in Suicide gives him 1 Strenght and a point in Remote Mines gives him +2 all stats.

Anyone else find it hard to 'get behind' teams as key players don't stay around long enough for us to care as spectators?,self.DotA2,Just wondering if anyone that watches the 'big teams' feel the same? My only problem with following team progression is that I don't really care about how a team progresses anymore due to how fast teams form and change their players.   I think it's a big issue with Dota as a spectator sport / e-sport the audience can't really get behind teams when the personalities that made you like the teams in the first place switch so fast.  Maybe its just me just thought I'd see if you guys cared or whether its just something stupid that bothers me. ,discussion

Valve I don't know if you realise what DotA is capable of being in the future.,self.DotA2,"Listen **Valve**   I loved the progress you made with the community over the past year but we gotta get a couple things straight:  * If only quarter of the prize money invested by players goes to the prizepool you have collected 74 363 748 **USD** for TI7  * Lets exaggerate and say one equivalent of the prizepool went into organizing the event all together  * You basically make infinite money because of Steam  * For some reason VR is your number one priority. Nothing wrong with that. It might be *the future* of gaming for casual *gamers*  * There is no way VR funding costs that much  * DotA 2 has the potential to become the best game ever made  * DotA 2 has the potential to be played for 100+ years. Making it a legitimate sport with stories legacies and emotion. Something a new generation can look up to.  * Unless you are making DotA 3 in VR I dont know what the fuck are you doing  * Maybe you could invest some time and money into making the dota dev team as big as it can get? You know so stuff like morphling ulti copying invokers exort for 10k damage doesnt happen.

33 Was trying to do something cool with that Aeon Disk,self.DotA2,Tobi and Kyle didn't get why 33 didn't make his Aeon Disk and left the Vit booster locked (I don't blame them it's late over there). So 33 wanted to get an Epi Burrow off but realised that if he took too much damage during the Epi or before he would deal no damage with the Epi. So his plan was to epi blink burrow and then once he was at a lower health to assemble the Aeon disk so he could still get out free.    It would have been a cool play had they not been SO far behind. It's the sort of thing that could have made a really big difference if they weren't quite so far behind.,discussion
I love that Dota doesn't have a surrender option,self.DotA2,"I played a few hours of league with a handful of buddies over the last few weeks in exchange for them joining me for some games of Dota. Holy shit I am so glad that we can't surrender in Dota.   We were only playing pubs so I think it's very probable that in ranked it's very different however there were VERY few games that ended in a victory that wasn't a surrender. I wouldn't let us surrender either (I believe I said ""You chose this life play the game that you chose to play""). It's actually because some of the most memorable gaming experiences I've had were absurd comebacks or when a friend or I have gotten laughably ahead so to allow for that to happen for both me and my enemies I never give up in games.  Essentially the games played out where I would extend that respect to my enemies and lost without surrendering (allowing them that satisfaction of winning and being ahead) or we would get ahead pre-20 and they would surrender. I got fed several times but every time the game would end at 20 minutes before my character would hit that fun point on the power curve where I could just not die or simply kill everyone who challenged me. The only games we won that didn't end in a surrender were pretty passive (which I honestly didn't expect from LoL) and everything was decided with one or 2 fights.  I mean my sample size is pretty small only around 20-30 hours of playing but after playing LoL again after all of these years I can say that surrendering is easily the least satisfying mechanic in that game for me and I'm very glad that it isn't in Dota.",discussion

How to fix MMR in DotA2 and what's wrong with it.,self.DotA2,"#What's Wrong with the MMR system and How to Fix It.  To start I'm going to **explain what is wrong** with DotA2's MMR system because I guarantee everyone is entering this thread and going to scream ""it's not broken 4head!""  Well *you're right*! **It isn't broken**... kind of. MMR works *perfectly fine* .... assuming a **large quantity of games played** and at a constant rate I might add.  So what does this mean?  *   Anyone who plays a **large quantity** of *solo ranked games*. Your MMR is *perfectly accurate*. If you're the kind of person who plays 8 matches a day and your MMR is still 2537 you probably are still +/-50 MMR accurate.  * Anyone who is under or over rated will likely have to play **hundreds** of games to reach their true MMR.  * Imagine you are rated at 3000 MMR. If your ""skill"" level rises to 4500 through various things coaching playing unranked practicing learning proper metas strategies changing your outlook etc. It will take a ridiculous amount of time to get to 4500 MMR.   * The following is me just making up numbers to the best of my ability but imagine you can maintain 80% winrate from 3000-3500 and then 65% from 3500-4000 and then 55% from 4000-4500. This is an *extremely* generous approximation but *even this* would require approximately **300** matches played!  Now the problem arises with people who *don't* play a **large quantity** of *solo ranked games*.  Lets say you play a lot of party queue games or perhaps you get coached or perhaps you simply decide to ""learn"" dota and watch a ton of replays and whatever other kind of practice you can do. Your skill level will *very likely rise*. And this goes both ways of course a 6k player who takes a break for school for 6 months and comes back is *absolutely not* a 6k player anymore. He could be as low skilled as 4k until he gets his practice back and even then could be starting from a 5k level again.  This is why everyone complains they have so many ""feeders"" in their games. This is due to the players who are *overrated*. Now you're probably asking what about the underrated players? Well they exist too but you probably just assume anyone doing well on your team is either lucky or you just don't think about it. See: [Negativity Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias)  Ok enough babbling.   ~~ **TL;DR:** The MMR System **does work.** But *only* in *large quantities* of solo ranked games.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  #HOW TO FIX THE MMR SYSTEM IN DOTA2#  * **Accelerated Change** : Essentially this is gaining or losing more MMR for having a high or low winrate over a period of time. The exact period would be up to Valve and their smart people. I'm sure they have some smart statisticians or similiar who can decide. But *for example* it would sample your matches on the past 15 games. If your winrate was 70% you would start earning more and more MMR per game. The opposite would hold true if you did poorly.     What would this do? Well it will accelerate the change in MMR. Now what are the effects of this? What comes to mind for me is the following:   * MMR will be *slightly less* accurate on an individual level **assuming a large quantity of games**. This is because fluctuations will be slightly larger. But someone maintaining ~50% will not see much effect from this.    * MMR will be *more* accurate on an individual level **assuming a low quantity of games**. This is because they will go up or down faster reaching a more accurate MMR more quickly.    * MMR as a *whole* will be more accurate as all players become more properly calibrated. Games will slowly become more and more balanced.   * Boosting will be easier. Is this a bad thing? **No!** You can't eliminate boosters people are going to do it. But if the boosters start winning MMR much more quickly then the account will go up *much much faster* resulting in **less games ruined**.    * The same holds true for when the boosted takes over he will start losing and dump MMR faster causing **less games ruined**.    * This might even kill boosting nobody would bother because their MMR will dump too quickly. Only people who showcase MMR and never play will still use boosting. (See: re-calibration for the solution to people who don't play at all.)   * **Re-Calibration** : Again pretty straight forward but **forced** re-calibration **without a choice to choose MMR** should be a thing. This worked perfectly in StarCraft2 where if you didn't play at all during a season you would be forced to recalibrate where you can generally move up or down an entire division. If you don't play for *2 entire seasons* then your rating is dumped completely and you have to start from scratch.   * Now because DotA2 is a team game it is much harder to calibrate than a solo 1v1 game. I don't think believe dropping MMR or forcing it every season it the best idea but if a **low quantity of solo games** are played then re-calibration could be flagged on an account. The players who are active and still playing should still have an accurate MMR and won't need to be re-calibrated.   * MMR becomes inaccurate over a long period of time with a low quantity of games. Personally I believe the *best way* to go about this would be to require a certain amount of games played in a year or else you will be placed into a queue for re-calibration. For example if you don't play 100 matches within 1 year then the system will eventually flag you for re-calibration.  * **Leagues/Divisions** : *Generally* using leagues or divisions is a personal preference because at the root it is still using your MMR number however it has some pros.   * In the case stats are used to assist in MMR calibration again hiding the changes behind the division will be a layer preventing people from gaming the system.   * They are prettier to look at than a simple number but of course this is just preference.   * The MMR Number could still be displayed if you mouse over your division or if Valve decides to try to phase it out they can make it accessible via the console.  * **POSSIBLY: Stats Influence MMR Change** : Now I know this is an **extremely** **controversial** one so take it with 3^2^2 bags of salt especially because of abusers and the fact that support is such a sacrificial role it's near impossible to rate support players on their stats. **However** I believe some important facts remain:   * Using stats would only be a small change to MMR increase or decrease compared to winning or losing a game. If you lose a game you still would lose for example -25 but if you played **exceptionally** well (I'm talking you're 30-3 and your team is all 0-15) perhaps you only lose 22 points.    * Stats would be compared to **other players** on the **same hero** at a **similar level**. Playing Zeus just because of his hero damage won't help you because everyone else playing Zeus also has a high hero damage. Playing Ember/Naga/AM/etc. because they have low deaths/high GPM won't help unless you do better than the other players at your level on that hero.    * Stats for *Core* heroes would still be relevant. Stat ratings for supports could be disabled entirely or only using sparingly. (Deaths Assists). Having 3/5th of your player base with slightly more accurate MMR is better than having nobody take advantage of it.    * Disabling or using stats sparingly for supports will cause support players to accelerate MMR more slowly (an underrated support won't go up *as* fast as an underrated core) but the system doesn't break. They just experience less acceleration for doing well or poorly.    * Again this is controversial and I think only the first suggestions (acceleration re-calibration & leagues) here are important but Valve could even add this under the hood to prevent people from gaming the system. Combined with Leagues hiding MMR and the new acceleration system it would be near impossible to even know Valve is using this so nobody would be complaining it is unfair for supports (it would be slightly) but in the end it would be beneficial overall in my opinion.    * And lastly - Yes stats don't always matter. You can have lower GPM more deaths less kills and still win a game through sheer skill and outplaying your opponent but this would only be a small increase/decrease to MMR per game and **on average** stats **do matter** (Stats don't lie!). A good player can definitely win a game from behind but on average a player with higher GPM/XPM/More Kills/Less Deaths/More Damage/Tower Damage/etc. will do better.      ^^^rest ^^^in ^^^peace ^^^inbox ",discussion

I'm an old man and cosmetics confuse my brain,self.DotA2,I know this might not affect you I know you might not care the majority of people will think I'm a blind scrub and should get glasses but I've seen a growing number of people on this subreddit that feel my pain and I want to share my story.  When there's a teamfight the particle effects are flying and I have a split second to make decisions I cannot always tell the difference between Skywrath in the Vigilance of the Manticore set and a Legion Commander.  I've mistaken a Spectre with the Flowering Shade set for Vengeful spirit and thrown a teamfight.  I've been hit with the new red Phoenix sun ray and shat myself because I didn't remember the Drakken laser drill being added to the game.  There's so many visual effects in Dota and I recognise and know how to react to all of them but every time some big ass flapping wings or blue glowing Earthshaker gauntlets get added to the game I find it that little bit harder to react to them I.E. I immediately fly into a crazed panic at the new effect I've not used to.  Now I love my hats as much as the next man that keeps throwing his non-expendable income at virtual dress ups but... can we please get a client side option to disable cosmetics?  I'll still shill out money to get my heroes looking good (obviously I don't mind if my own hero has custom cosmetics since I don't get confused by skills that I'm casting) and the majority of people wouldn't utilise this option but does anyone agree it would be nice to have?

I analyzed every Chronosphere cast in the Main Event of TI6 and here are the results,self.DotA2,* There were **206 chronospheres** in **21 Faceless Void games** with an average of **981 chronos per game**. Of those 13 caught no enemy heroes at all (63% of the total) and 2 were cast by **Alliance.EGM**'s Rubick.  * **EG.Universe** played Faceless Void the most: 4 games (3 victories) and used 50 chronospheres (**244% of total chronospheres**).  * The highest amount of chronospheres in a single game was 15 and it happened three times: two wins for **EG.Universe** and one win for **Wings.Shadow**.   * The lowest amount of chonosphere in a single game was 6 and it happened in two different games: A win for **DC.Resolut1on** and a loss by **OG.Moon**.  * **TNC.Sam H.** had the most precise chronospheres vs OG on game 2: He caught 26 heroes in 11 uses for an **236** average.  * On the same game **Sam H.** also landed 3 **four-man chronos**. There were only 4 other four-man chronos in the entire main event by Moon Moo MP and Resolut1on.  * **MVP.MP** had the game with the **most lethal chronospheres** vs OG. He cast the spell 7 times whereas **19 enemy heroes died in the teamfights that followed** whether they were hit by the spell or not.  * On DC vs EHOME **DC.Resolut1on** cast **9** chronospheres his first being at **9:09** and  finished the game with **9** kills.  * Out of the players with more than 1 game on Faceless Void **OG.Moon** had the **2nd best average heroes hit per chronosphere** with 202 on two games. However he lost those games. The other two games of OG in the Main Stage also featured a Faceless Void in the enemy team making OG **1/4 in games with Faceless Void** on them.

The Dota 2 Workshop and Economy: Problems and Solutions,self.DotA2,    This is written from an artist point of view.  **Item interest has gone down mainly because of 4 main factors.** -------  * **Reborn UI** * **Trading** * **Shop** * **Workshop**  -  To elaborate here is a list of all the major problems we can think of right now that contribute to the decline of the economy.  -  *Reborn UI*  * No in game store page. Many users dont go outside the game client for Dota 2 related stuff. Make it easier for them to find and buy in the game. * No ways to display our profiles or personalise our client. Loading images dont load as background in the main screen. No way to show our personalised hero loadout in our profile. Only 3 tiny thumbnail images to show off our items. * Effigy creation is bugged in reborn. * A lot of items are bugged in reborn especially arcanas. * Equipped items dont swap out after trading and reloading the hero in game by dying.  * Armory link is harder to get to nested inside the HEROES page. * Featured Heroes page feels cramped. * The hero loadout page to equip items is more complicated than it should be and inconsistent to the simpler hero pick screen item equip page.  * Better structured Custom games UI that had panels like the main UI showing of new and popular mods will free up room in the main UI for a better store advertisements and sales panel. * Lower drop rate of free item in game after a match.  - *Workshop Requirements Page*  * Outdated models and texture packages on some heroes. * No new heroes to work on when troll and tinker Winter Wyvern phoenix and undying have been broken down for months. * Page is difficult to find on the main workshop page; Art guideline pages difficult to find for newbies and less user friendly to view compared to the CS:GO workbench guide.  - *Trading locks and rarity*  * Over Saturation of items have worn out the player base. * Cant trade items for months at a time. * Rarity means nothing anymore only arcana has a little prestige because of the high monetary value.  * Whole item sets are set to mythical; unlike in the past where only the best item in the set will have the tag Mythical or Rare. * Lack of Common and Uncommon sets.  - *Item store never gets any new items*  * Everything is hidden in a RNG limited time chest * Or double hidden in compendium chests or stretch goals. * People have no real way to impulse buy things they like and see in game. * Items do not display the list of authors on a set so artists get no branding.  - *Chests that do go in are only tournament or event chests*  * For an artist its who you know not how good you are or how many votes you get. * Chests have a sharp sales fall off compared to sets as the sales for the chest drop as soon as a new chest come out which could be a week apart.  * Where as with sets it will always stay relevant with flash sales and impulse buys from the store or hero loadout.  - *Workshop is stale*   * No feedback from valve sets will rot on the store with no word on if valve has even seen the set and artists can feel demoralised and stop making new items. * Cramped and clunky layout makes for little patience to view. * Voting Items/collections get minimal exposure on the main workshop page. * Voting queue is slow clunky and makes you full view collections with no in game images and asks for votes just on that. * Voting doesnt correlate to sales data. * No clear way to upload and submit music packs and scores to the workshop.  - - -----------------------------  **Possible Solutions** ----   *Reborn UI*   * Give more UI to showcasing items and personalising our profile Source 1 had 6 + loadout reborn has 3. * Bring back the buy this set option in the pick screen * Bring back a proper store front in the Main Client. Have it in one of the main tabs at the top of the screen. * Bring back a hero show off in the dota profile. * Simplify the Hero loadout screen to equip items. * The featured page should load more heroes that you can scroll through like card mode in all pick with UI for links on how to purchase the items equipped there.  * The featured page should be scaled so the heroes dont look so cramped.   - *Tournament UI*  * Tournament View sections should have Direct links to their chests to buy like their tickets.  * Premier Tournaments should get a featured page too with advertising to their bundle and their tournament streams extras and a calendar with options to follow tournaments in game with steam or in game notifications on when they are going live. *    *Shop*  * Have a shop front in Reborn in the UI * Add full sets back to the store at a medium pricing $4-6 and couriers * Have limited edition items on the store that show up for 12 hours every few weeks. Put it on rotation with a selection of limited edition sets. Make their prices high ie $10-12. * Add back 99c singles chests with special effects MADE by FX artists of the workshop. Have them submit FX chest ideas and the best ones go through. * Have loadout animations and taunts be equippable and submittable in the workshop. add those to the 2.50 chests as bonuses.    - *Tournament Chests*  * Have tournaments apply for tournament item bundles/chests. Determine the contents based on the initial prize pool or budget of the tournament High prize pools get 2-3 sets medium gets 2-3 single items and everything else can have 1 single item.  * Valve curates items from the workshop to add to the bundles. Splits are pre set for each budget bracket and cannot be changed. ie high prize tournaments have a 75/25 split medium prize pool tournaments gets 65/35 and low gets 60/40. * Have a maximum number of tournament chests available for application each month in each bracket to not swamp the store. * Have timelines for tournaments as to when their bundle will be added ahead of time so the tournaments can organise marketing and other plans around it also to stop tournament chests getting released 1 week from the tournament grand finals resulting in low crowdfunding and marketing.   - *Make the workshop more accessible*  * Workshop queue is clunky and annoying make a scrolling queue at the top of the item page that shows 1 image of the set in game name of collection and author a favourite button and a link to the collection/item page. * Add collections to the main (most popular today) thumbnail wall. * If a uploaded item is in a collection by the same author remove all entries from the front page and only add the collection thumbnail. * Add the workshop voting queue to the Reborn UI somewhere. * Add more images to collection pages so people don't have to click on an item to see it in game also let up put images in the description like regular item pages. * Follow Workshopper button is quite hidden and could perhaps be a button directly on the item/collection pages to follow all the creators * Have a way to pre order sets where people drop some money to pre purchase the set they want a few days before it goes live. Where they have the option to pay the rest of the cost.  - *Sets sit on the workshop with no feedback*  * Add a simple red/green light system for valve to quickly give feedback on if a set is accepted or rejected.  * Add a simple 2 second feedback survey for a reviewer could be a 10 or so choice of feedback lines that they can respond with like: Does not fit in the style of Dota 2 please read the art guidelines at LINK for more information.  - -------- -  **Workshop UI:**  -  Why does this get more real estate...

Full translation of LGD.Ruru Scandal,self.DotA2,"Original post : [Link](https://www.zhihu.com/question/54026580/answer/137989692)  This is a word by word translation I am trying to keep the original tone as much as possible.  The OP is the cofounder and  former employee of VPGAME which is the biggest Esports betting site in China owned by LGD.  Ruru is the owner of LGD LFY all cdec teams VPGAME and KeyTV.  &nbsp;  **The post has 2 parts**  &nbsp;  Disclaimer by OP: Perfect World does not know about the API-KEY and all players are respectable.   &nbsp;  **Part1(not too related to the topic I will briefly explain it if would be grateful if someone wants to expand part1)**  OP wanted to leave VPgame to join his friend's company(C5game). There were some disputes about his stock in VPgame and C5game copying VPgame's product. LGD.ruru sued him right after they made some agreements so OP went mad and exposed all the stuff below.  **One thing worth mentioning is that Ruru asked him to use his connection to delete bad posts about Nanyang replay cup(Nanyang crusie) because people was flaming her for match fixing and airing replays.**  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Part2(""I"" refers to OP)**  **In 2013 Ruru stole an API-KEY from Steam**. The normal API-KEY can only view the data of public matches however the stolen one was able to view private matches and this is the reason why  VPGAME in early stage can view the results of private matches. Using this API-KEY under the instruction of Ruru **we build a database system which was able to browse other teams' training results(draft/build)** so that we can figure out the opponents' strategies and the way to counter it. Personally I think all the players who accomplished things are legit and I don't think any of the players were using those data I think it is mostly for the stats man in the team.  &nbsp;  proof  [original](https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-3d5a395f53fe88059c15fe2f61e33bcc_r.jpg) //////////// [**mirror**](http://imgur.com/1W11CWc)  If you try to go to http://www.vpgame.com/das/ then it redirect you to the login page that means the page actually exists.  Since you try to go a page under vpgame.com but it doesn't exist it will return a 404 error.  For people who need further explanation:( means scrim)  [original](https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-7c40ea0218a0dfe50cd7cb5c1421e38c_r.png) //////////// [**mirror**](http://imgur.com/eLRej5S)  Those two games are scrims between IG.V and IG for pro teams keeping scrims results secretive is extremely important.  &nbsp;  **The other thing is (another Chinese betting site)'s dragonclaw hook and Rotten Stache got stolen.**  When we first got the API we didn't know we could **move users' items using the API**. After Ruru mentioned it we tried it and it worked out and we reported to Ruru. Then what we did was move 's dragonclaw hook and Rotten Stache to DOTAMAX(another Chinese site more similar to dotabuff but has betting function as well) to create more chaos we moved some of VPGAME's arcanas to DOTAMAX too. **So that we can fool Valve that DOTAMAX scammed those items.(ajijijiji added this op wasn't being too clear ajijijiji was a bit confused early too)**  [original](https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-eb2252a8c9e703fdce188b05cf276b78_r.png) //////////// [**mirror**](http://imgur.com/qihVttg)  (this is my(ajijijiji) tranlation this is a chat group and the chat group name is ""**founders of VPGAME**"" 3 means the group has total number of 3. **OP(green) said  has already reported to Valve about the loss and then Ruru( the female avatar) said move 200 arcanas to DOTAXMAX and report loss to Valve as well**)  &nbsp;  **Update**  the das section under vpgame has already been deleted but still it says updating it would be 404 error if it doesn't exist at all.  &nbsp;  **Most recent update**  Look at those complaints made by users about losing items  [**mirror**](http://imgur.com/uvnCmol)  LMAO Ruru even made post on SGamers to flame me. I am not gonna expose much more proofs because I need to save some for myself for the trial case. You will regret for it if I actually expose it(kinda hard to translate this line but u get the meaning). It would ruin the whole esports industry.  &nbsp;  **Update** credit to /u/Aelvez  News Update: A former Valve employee(Langelic he disclosed his identity) confirmed the existence of said key. He also said he was aware of the drama and had reported it to Icefrog in November. [source](https://www.zhihu.com/question/54026580/answer/138129296)  Conversation with Icefrog(in English check the date too): [pic1](http://imgur.com/a/CZWlp) [pic2](http://imgur.com/a/txaNc)   &nbsp;  **Everything above was from the original OP**.   &nbsp;  **TLDR for lazy people**  &nbsp;  LGD is the owner of the biggest betting site in China - VPGAME  LGD.ruru stole an API-KEY  VPGAME was able get scrim data of all other teams.  VPGAME was able to move items freely between any steam users they did it in a way making valve think other competitors(DOTAMAX) scams their users.  &nbsp;  ***Here is my take on this:***  Ruru is the owner of LGD(pro team) VPGAME(betting site) KeyTV(the one which ruined Shanghai Major and got fired midway) due to conflict of interest I am not sure if this is allowed.   Also Ruru's ex-husband jingling(they divorced) is a key figure in Perfect World.   Chinese dota fans are already suspecting if LGD has some secret deal to Valve so that Valve send LGD to Boston.   Ruru is also the girlfriend of Inflame(who used to play for ehome and cdecy) and has a lot contracts dispute with other pro players. ",discussion

I wanted to say a few things!,self.DotA2,"I want to start off by saying that I don't post on Reddit much if at all mainly because it seems that just reading is enough to glean what criticism I can for my commentary and just try to improve from there. (Also I'm a pretty shitty writer in general lololol)  But it has occurred to me that there are a lot (more than I'd like) of you who seemingly can't stand my commentary for multiple reasons I'd like to dedicate this post to you guys especially.  If there are others out there who like what I do already then that's great too.  When I first started commentating I lacked a lot of what you would call ""confidence"" in many aspects of the game because even though I had played DotA for a number of years off and on I was never a pro.  I moved to HoN and played professionally there for a short time did fairly well and decided to retire.  My point is as I commentated more and more it's only natural to feel more comfortable with something.  Your mind innately goes to a very black and white state where you just say ""Oh this is good"" or ""This is bad"" and the reasoning is pretty straight forward.    As a commentator analytical or not we try to sound sure of ourselves so that our audience (the ones maybe not as experienced in DotA) can follow the game whilst we try our best to paint a picture verbally for them to follow.  For example what lineup is better at what point in the game what the other team can do to try to stop that team in the alotted time etc.  This is a very basic example but the point I'm stressing is we have to deliver a storyline for whomever can't piece it together themselves just by watching.  Under normal circumstances this kind of mentality I would say is normal maybe even acceptable; but in a game like DotA that is ever changing I don't think I can afford to be that way anymore.  I will admit that I am probably one of the harshest commentators (maybe the worst) when it comes to how I express my thoughts on the state of the game.  This is inherently where the problem lies.  We have gotten to a point where the community in general have  much more knowledge than they used to. Even enough to the point where they can call out blatant mistakes by commentators during the game and then it starts all sorts of other issues that we (myself included) can sometimes get defensive over.  On top of that I am wrong often.  Not just a little a lot.  DotA is a game that is so complex that it's very difficult to glean what can make or break a game just by watching.  As I mentioned previously I've never played professionally so I lack a lot of the experience that obviously pros WOULD have to correct me on issues of which I'm wrong.  My solution to this is to try and watch more games pay closer attention to finer details and restrain myself from saying things that are absolutes this really kills credibility for commentators especially when we're wrong.  I of course am no exception to this.  On a final note; this is actually something that I was hesitant to write because I am known as a bit of a DotA 2 rager.  When I'm playing with my friends I do get a bit irritable but I've known them all for around 10 years.  They know I'm not being serious and the people in the house also realize that I'm not genuinely angry with them in any way; when we commentate together it's all in good fun and I guess it's part of my quirks to be the ornery old looking guy.  I think most people who have met me realize that my personality is far from what it is during a losing DotA 2 game as I'm sure some of you out there have experienced yourselves.  I feel that I've covered most of what I wanted to say it's probably full of grammatical errors and all sorts of horrible nonsense.  I really appreciate the time if any of you took to read it all the way through I'll try my best to keep improving to give you all a better listening and viewing experience.  My journey in DotA 2 so far has been fantastic mainly thanks to you guys at home reading this post.  I'd do anything in my power to stay as long as possible so if you have anything you'd like to say in terms of what I can do better; post away.  Love you guys!  Edit - Same paragraph twice! XD    I've been responding to what I can for the last hour or two but it's light outside and I need to sleep!  Thanks for your support you're all dabes.    Okay REALLY SLEEPING THIS TIME.  Edit 2.0 - I woke up a little while ago and while I can't respond to everyone I appreciate the time you all took to write here and add your criticisms or just saying your thanks.

Low Priority bot abusers receiving 8 year bans.,self.DotA2,"*FOR THE PEOPLE BELIEVEING THEY ARE DOING NOTHING WRONG USING THESE BOTS PLEASE SEE SECTION 4 OF TOS AND STOP ARGUING WITH EVERYONE IN THE THREAD. WHEN YOU STILL FEEL THE ARGUE ABOUT IT JUST READ THE SECTION THAT SAYS THEY CAN CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT AT ANYTIME WITHOUT GIVING YOU NOTICE: http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/*  Over the last week or so I have seen an increase in the number of people being banned until 2025. The one thing all of these players have in common when you search through their opendota or dotabuff accounts is that they had recently played in Single Draft games with 9 bots. When confronted about it most players are saying that they did not have anything to do with the bots but rather that they paid for a low priority removal service.   https://imgur.com/a/rBrLW  https://imgur.com/a/SJEn0  I have also seen some players complaining about their 8 year bans who admit that the account is bought. Is this what we have been waiting for? Account boosters being put of of business with the accounts they sell being flagged for a ban? I sure hope so.  Does anyone else have any more info on this. Has this being going on for long or is it relatively new step forward?   **EDIT**  Here is a sample of 2 games played by a banned player for you to see;  https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3394327154  https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3394297634  **EDIT 2**  Some players being banned are also reporting that a few days prior they received this message on their accounts for a few hours.  https://imgur.com/EDBCySB  **EDIT 3**  There are comments in the thread indicating that players abusing bots are also receiving bans from 1 - 3 months long. Makes it seem as though there is some sort of system in place for how often or much you used a bot service?  **EDIT 4**  The following is a comment from u/henry_rd . Thanks to his comment we can now see that it is no longer speculation and it is happening.   ""I was banned not for 8 years but for long enough that I could get another account to 6k (banned mmr) before i'm unbanned. I have really been working on behavior and it's a shame I was banned for mistakes I worked hard to try to fix but I understand it and won't be getting in LP again. I really feel the #1 reason I used bots is because I saw other people who ruined my games do it and it's pretty rage inducing to be toxic and have other toxic people just get out of jail free so you kinda want what they have. But I'm still accountable and I'm thankful valve doesn't IP ban so I can prove I am #reformed.""",discussion
The Manila Major Group Stages Feedback Thread,self.DotA2,Hello there  The group stage is *almost* over and now its time to pack up and move production to the Mall of Asia Arena. In the last couple of days youve seen me and my colleague /u/BossmanCG pop up from thread to thread to answer questions and talk about issues you mightve raised. You may have even seen some of [our production vlogs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc04j0shLOEda3Zww-nSj4zDq5FWMY61Q) from behind the scenes and today a [Facebook post by our broadcast director](https://www.facebook.com/petrescu.vlad.1/posts/803735113095359?pnref=story) was featured on the front page for a while.   So we havent been that secretive but we havent been 100% honest either. This is our first big international Dota 2 LAN event. While we do have Dota 2 ex-pros in our crew overall the team is a noob when it comes to Dota 2. I myself have only played the tutorials and a couple of bot-matches. :)   So it is our turn as a team as a crew as a group of people working on a project together to ask you what you think about this event so far. Truthfully honestly in the spirit of constructive criticism and making this event great. For everybody.   * What features did you like? * What features didnt you like? * What would you like to be added? * How do you feel about outside-of-the-game features?  * Camera work sound design video content interviews? * What do you expect from the Main Event? * What do you definitely NOT want to see at the Main Event? (outside of delays which we get are nasty but theyre nasty for us too) :)  Tell us. We will listen and we will care.   EDIT: Wow you guys have A LOT of opinions. Which is a good thing. While we cannot answer each individual we do read every single comment here I and the crew. Thank you for your input! Today we spent setting up MOA. You should see that stage... but i guess you have to be a little patient. :),discussion
Compendium updates have clogged the developer pipeline leaving old content to rust,self.DotA2,"#edit: problem is the community not valve  The latest compendium promises battle cups player cards more predictions another round of immortal cosmetics lockless cosmetics and TI merchandise items.  _____________________________________________________________________________  We're anxiously waiting for compendium content that Valve is piling up while the following issues have taken a back seat:  * Performance - There's currently a front page thread full of users explaining how source 1 had better FPS. We understood that a new engine would introduce some short-term problems but we're getting to the point where this is a serious issue.  * Guilds - ??? What can you even write here to emphasize how much of a colossal failure has taken place. This was functionality that had the potential to be extremely useful. Think of the possibilities: Organizing in-house leagues? Catching up with your regional chat? The UI is awful I'd rather mash a bunch of Steam profile ID's into a .txt file to stay organized.  * Replay Takeover - Yet another glorious feature Valve rolled out to us that has been left to rot. Let's be clear: failing to port over source 1 content means source 2 hasn't been fully rolled out.  * LAN - Have people forgotten about this? Does anybody else remember when this was a huge deal? This used to be a weekly demand on this subreddit for years. We got a botched pseudo-LAN ""dev solution"" that filled a checkbox. People were extremely disappointed. Remember when we would fantasize about running tournaments on ACTUAL LAN? IN THE YEAR 2013.    * Leaderboards - Go visit dota2.com/leaderboards. What in the hell is going on?  _____________________________________________________________________________  Dota 2 used to be in a place where we thought: ""Wow! I can't wait to play Dota 2 next year Valve is going to add x y z."" Now we just want that cool XYZ shit to work.  It seems that Valve has funneled all of their dev time into delivering features alongside the compendium. We no longer play a free game with free updates. We play a free game with sponsored updates.   Not sold? Those battle cup tickets are for compendium owners. Veterans think about how that compares to older updates.",discussion

Stack 5 camps at once on Radiant with Venomancer at lvl 1,self.DotA2,After though after some testing I found that you can use plague wards to aggro creeps multiple times before they stack meaning they will run out and back into the camp before stacking. Using this to stack 2 camps in advance stacking 2 with your hero and  stacking the last with a plague ward on the stack time you can stack the entire jungle without too much micro.  https://youtu.be/AEiuAtHmiQg   For this to work you need to cut down at least 4 trees with tangos  or your/ally quelling blade . Also you need vision of the far right camp this could mean a observer ward but you can use another plague ward as well.  https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2p6cQ24tviiX0JoMkRHOUFnVmM  Keep in mind that plague wards WILL block camps.  This should work with any creeps as long as you don't put the  wards too close to the edge of the cliff when there are ranged creeps.  As for dire I found its best to only stack 3. You could stack the other 2 but you will have to pull the large camp to the left into the lane and a plague ward by the small camp will die easily to any ranged creeps.  https://youtu.be/0LZgbLQMADI,discussion

Idea for new game mode: New Meta,self.DotA2,Top 5 heroes by pick rate are banned  Top 5 heroes by winrate are banned.  If they overlap as in ODs winrates high and so is his popularity he counts as a winrate hero and the algorithm changes to the 6th most popular and so on until the ten heroes are banned.  The game otherwise plays like All pick (ranked pick version in ranked unranked in unranked)  For example this week: Invoker Pudge Legion Commander Juggernaut and Phantom Assassin would be banned for having a high pick rate.  Omniknight Spectre Necrophos Abaddon and Ursa would be banned for having a high winrate.  This mode would not replace all pick but would let us get away from the meta. Though it would instantly have its own meta of course it would at least be a major change.  EDIT: Ban pick pick Ban and All ban. Whatever the game modes name where everyone gets one ban would be nice but Valve has ignored us on that.  EDIT2: Idk why so many people think that all pick would suddenly go away if they added this mode but no it is not intended to replace all pick.,discussion

Well as I'm still closely knit with the company I've been hearing many rumors and speculation as to the location of this year's TI.  If you haven't heard [Key Arena's remodel has been finally approved](https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/nba/keyarena-mou-approved-by-seattle-city-council-will-nhl-announcement-soon-follow/) and may start this year. If so we're looking at an Arena that can't be used.   Supposedly according to my colleagues TI8 would take place in Canada making the only logical location [Rogers Arena](https://rogersarena.com/) due to its sheer size. I'm not going to comment on the political nature of the change because TI8 could just as easily be hosted out of CenturyLink Field in Seattle being just as massive (and with an attached theater for tourist attractions).   Anyhow that's my TI news. I hope it's not true because if so that means it's going to be real costly to get to Canada for me and HOW WILL I MAKE ANOTHER GUIDE?  Bah.,discussion

A PSA to all the people who are in LP due to valid reports.,self.DotA2,People have been crying and moaning lately because of the recent pro players that have been put in LP due to reports.  If you were put in LP due to being toxic/leaving games then you deserve everything you get.   Your teammates abandon 50 mins into a game and your lp win doesn't count? Your fault for abandoning a team of good players who want to play DoTA.  Your team flames and feeds every game? Your fault for doing the same to legit players.  That NP tps and dies as much as possible? Your fault for feeding in your game.  Seriously get over yourself. Just because pro players are constantly being put in lp due to targeted reports that doesn't mean the same is happening to you. In your bracket its very unlikely you will encounter the same player twice or get targeted reports. Getting reported 4 times in one game wont put you in LP you need to be reported in several of your games. Stop being an asshole and you wont be in LP and stop making excuses like you are entitled to ruin as many games as you want.  RIP my karma I will take the downvotes from all the mad kids in lp.  /thread.   *Edit* I really didn't realize that people liked this post. Thanks everyone for your comments.

"Why the ""No Cellphone/Can't afford"" argument is weak and people should stop using it.",self.DotA2,"Most of the concern about the Matchmaking update is that there are players who can't afford to buy or own a cellphone.

Now let's talk about those genuinely poor but are somehow still able to spend money on internet cafes (you probably can't buy your own pc right?)  I'm sorry but you guys will have to compromise. You are the minority here and it's not even that hard to do. All you need is a SIM CARD and those are cheap. If you played 2 games of Dota in a net cafe then you could have bought a SIM CARD already. Now the hard part is getting a phone to complete the authentication. Maybe you could borrow from your parent or a friend. Hell why don't you borrow the cashiers cellphone. All you need is to put in the SIM CARD you just bought and go ahead and follow Valve's instructions to link your number to your steam profile then to your Dota profile.  We are already in the digital age where even those who are extremely underprivileged have access to technology albeit outdated ones.   So for those countries with the ability to play Dota buying a cheap mobile should be no problem at all.

A responsive DotA2 map?,self.DotA2,###What do we think about an update to the map where the aesthetics of the lanes/jungle and potentially base/river vary depending on the lane balance (or other game aspects)?.   *(I think the status of the towers is the most obvious candidate as we dont want to use things like XP/Gold lead or player presence to give away in-game aspects that shouldn't be identifiable in-game.)*    #### Anyway basic proposition:    If the tower balance in a given lane is neutral (2 each 1 each etc.) the aesthetics remain as default.    If a given lane has a tower advantage the surrounding ground could begin to transform to favour the aesthetics of the advancing team such as:    + If Radiant has an advantage small tufts of grass could break through the barren ground   - If Dire has an advantage the grass patches and fades to brown.    If a given lane has a multiple tower advantage some more grand aesthetic changes could take place in that lane and surrounding zone such as:    + Larger flowering trees for Radiant. Additions of critters and the like.   + The Dire could see more volcanic effects perhaps some sulphur plumes erupting along the lane. Deeper fault lines in the jungle and surroundings.      If **all** the lanes have a tower advantage for the same team the base and river could see aesthetic responses too:     + I'm thinking a literal river of fire for the Dire.   - A quaint set of flowering Lily pads for the Radiant.        #### Considerations      I think the implementation of all these changes would be flawed if it were a sudden transformation so its not a small ask to code in a progressive flow of aesthetic changes. That being said I personally could see this adding another layer of atmosphere to the game and to the spectator element of the sport.      #### Questions   + *Is there any scope of this getting opened up to the community as a workshop element?*   - *Would this whole idea be something that adds value to the community or detracts/distracts during gameplay?*   + *Any suggestions or perhaps designs to share?*,discussion
The Greatest Matchmaking Complaint Ever,dotametrics.wordpress.com,,discussion
Everything wrong with ranked matchmaking,self.DotA2,**Pick order**  Most high MMR players would agree that having second pick is a big advantage in ranked.  It is often very disadvantageous to reveal cores before the enemy team as you open youself up to being countered.  In high MMR games you can have four 5-6ks and one 8k player.  And same on the other team.  And there's a lot of weight on your shoulder to carry.  This task becomes much harder when you are forced show your pick before the enemy 8k.  A possible solution might be to adopt the pick order of Captain's Mode.  After all ranked is supposed to be a serious and competitive matchmaking system why not mimic a tournament pick order.  It's not perfect since in a pub setting draft strategy is dwarfed thus showing 3/5 heroes first as FP might still be disadvantageous.  But it would be better than the current show 5/5 heroes first as FP.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Randoming**  In my opinion randoming in ranked should not be allowed or only be allowed up to the first two picks.  Draft is an important element to the game and the damage can be irrecoverable if a player is to third pick random a Lich when we already have CM and Rubick (as is often the first two picks are supports in high MMR games).  The player is at fault here for pressing that button that can potentially ruin the game.  But why does the game incentivise this by providing such an option in the first place let alone with extra gold at that.  Why could this not be something that was left behind in unranked where things are meant to be more casual.  As you would not consciously random a hero in a tournament setting you should not be randoming a hero in ranked where it's to simulate a competitive matchmaking experience.    &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Gameruining & Punishment**  I was one of many that rejoiced in seeing harsher punishments for frequent LPQs.  But I'm starting to have doubts in its effectiveness.  I've played 12 games yesterday and [about 9 of them were ruined] (https://pastebin.com/b8JquNWR).  This is not a rare occurrence it's quite literally every day.  If there's one thing I admire about Riot it's that they take their user experience seriously.  So much so that they're willing to permanently ban a player for repeated toxic behaviour (as in if found playing on any account he would be banned on sight).    I think that's a little extreme but the message is clear; don't ruin games.  What difference is there of a player who ruins games by hacking (VAC) and a player who ruins games by breaking items and running down mid every other game.    In comparison dodge punishment goes from 5min 10min to a 24hr lockout.  It's so brutal that I did not see anyone messing around with it even back when dodging was common.  Dodging hardly harms anyone and yet it seems to yield harsher punishment than actual gameruining.  I'd like to see harsher punishments for LPQ.  A full day lockout from the get go maybe?  At least from ranked.  I never have reports these days either.  I don't know if anyone does anymore.  I report toxic enemies too but as I understand it I only get my report back if others report him for same offense (comm. abuse).  But that's worthless since no one wants that guy to tank a comm. ban they want him to serve LPQ.  Which means no one will tick the box for comm. abuse when reporting.  Reporting enemies seems a good way to throw away your reports.  It's a broken and ineffective system.  If enemy is breaking items and running down mid I'd like to report him for just that please.  Some of these pick related issues occur with multiple players wanting to play the same role.  Could the game introduce a way to queue with role (or two) preference so that we may not have two players bicker about who goes mid and one of them ends up jungling or randoming out of spite?  This wouldn't work so well in the very *very* high MMR games since you can easily end up with four core players (as they tend to have high MMR).  But you can have different rules above a certain MMR.  What may work for a 3k bracket may not work for 7k.  Just anything to make the game experience a little less painful.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Closing thought**  This is not my first time making a thread like this.  And I hardly doubt it will be my last.  It frustrates me to no end that Valve knowing that they have many things on their plate takes this long to address problems that is the *actual experience of the game*.  Sometimes I think it's an awareness problem.  Maybe they don't know that it's a problem and I make these threads in hopes of addressing exactly that.  But it's still frustrating when it took them literally years to fix the duos on solo queue which only seemed such a reasonable request.    The only pub experience I have is in NA and maybe it's not so bad in other regions.  I do believe that every region should have a slightly different matchmaking system (and punishments too) as every region is different in pub culture.  I don't think you can apply the same rules globally.  Please fix what's broke our user experience.  If ever people get tired of the game and move on it won't be because of the game itself but the people.  And its lack of rules to govern them.   ,discussion
Pro Scene just doesn't feel the same anymore...,self.DotA2,I followed the professional Dota scene for around 2 years rather religiously but lately it just seems like its lost everything I had originally enjoyed. I loved watching tournaments seeing my favorite players on my favorite teams much like any other popular competitive activity. But within the past year around the time before TI4 the consistency and professionalism of the scene really lost its touch to me. Teams now are playing tournaments with 2/3 stand ins rosters are changing once a week it feels impossible to actually enjoy watching a team since one month someone like n0tail is on fnatic moves to secret then after a few months he gets moved to cloud9. Or the whole debacle with Meepwn'd they are together for a few months constant drama posts on this subreddit a loss or two at some tournaments and the team is gone. It seems like after one loss with a new roster every team is just giving up and changing the core of their team rather than just working out the issues and coming back stronger in the next tournament.  This is probably just me its just been frustrating me since it used to be something I would consider myself passionate about. It just seems like most teams lost a grip on how they used to manage teams and rather than simply working out the kinks after a loss they go straight to cutting half their roster and letting everything the identity of their teams go. Obviously roster changes are sometimes necessary (post TI4 Navi for example) but this just seems like once the major roster changes occurred after TI4 they never stopped.,discussion

Ame now has flamed the whole Chinese dota community.,self.DotA2,"Background: In today's match LGD carry player Ame has used antimage to eliminate Burning and attack his own items on the highground of IG. Then in the later game against Liquid LGD throws(should be ""lose"") two games. Ame also was famous about hating Burning in Chinese community. Once in a pub and stream ame was opponent of Burning and he shout out on the game""kill that turtle kill that turtle""(turtle is an extremly insulting nick name of Burning in Chinese community)  Chinese community become furious on Ame and curse him on his latest weibo here are some top ranked comments:  1. I wish you that one day when you are going to retired your opponent will pick the hero which you used to play the best. Then he will push on your highground in 30mins and send the words""gg wp"" to you.  2.Low personality person you will never achieve the level of honor of B-god liquid will teach you how to be mature.  3.Mr. ""blink and kill your mother"" I will keep an eye on you until one day your mother has been dead and I will dance before her tomb. (the memes of why Chinese call ame the Mr. ""blink and kill your mother' originate from: once a fans of lgd tell ame why not buy a blink dagger in the match so that they will not lose in the match then ame reply him:""I would more like to buy a blink dagger and use that to kill your mother "" then all Chinese fans call him Mr.""blink dagger and kill your mother"" to blame ame.)  4. I wish liquid to beat you to the extent that your mother will not recognise you (this comment was early before the match between lgd and liquid and all the replies under this comments are congratulations and laughings)  5.you like to attack your item? could you attack your item before liquid. huh?  6.""I ame  like to attach my item on the highground and take the plane to go home""  7. I wish you daddy liquid will teach you how to play dota and know to respect others.  8.I heard a joke"" there is a fool dog who like to attack his item""  9. Instant karma feels good about it.  10. ATME!(another nick name of ame given by Chinese community means everyone could get gold from him always used when ame was killed by others)  There are more than 4000 comments on ame's latest weibo and nearly 99/100 of the comments are criticises and curses on ame. Forgive my poor English. Here is the link of the source:http://www.weibo.com/5695452105/FbUwFlsqj?filter=all&type=comment#_rnd1502510089544  Update1: Now in Chinese forums such as weibo tieba sgamer. No one talk about Dendi and AI no one discuss two new heros and no one care about tomorrow's final matches. Everyone is discussing AME and Burning. Tons of criticises and blames are blurstting under the weibo of LGD official account old eleven Ame and so on. What a big storm...  Update2: As required by ""zhangfeideya"" in order to clarify why those fans of B-god are so furious about Ame I will give an introduction about some fans (not all of the fans ) of Burning who are easily to be furious. Since Burning has played dota1 and dota2 for so long time. He gains a huge number of fans. Inevitably some of them are zealots of Burning who can not accept any criticisms (or anything seems insulting) on him. These fans have been called ""the nuclear bomb fans"" of Burning partly because one of Burnings nickname (not a good nick name) is ""the nuclear bomb""(a famous meme in Chinese dota community) partly because those zealots of Burning are easily to get exploded emotionally on the criticism (or anything seems insulting) on Burning.",discussion

The nature of ACE's ban on wings,self.DotA2,For those who have not been following the fiasco here is a quick outline of the main events:  1. Wings were on very good terms with their boss before TI.  2. After TI the boss got a large slice of the TI money as per contract agreement and promptly lost it all on a LoL investment  3. The boss stopped paying wings for 2 months and did not respond to communications.  4. At this point **according to Chinese labour laws wings has full right to terminate their contracts at any time** and the wings boss would need to pay like a full year wage of compensation. But the wings guys just left and formed a team with no fuss.  5. Wings guys posted a blog update about their new team Random and said they are still on friendly terms with the old boss. At this point the issue is somewhat settled and the boss has accepted his loss because he was at fault.  6. About 3 weeks has passed. Team Random went on to play in the major where they didn't place well but showed strength here and there by taking games off top teams including 1-2 against both grandfinalists. They aren't doing amazing but probably still in line for a TI invite.  Now at this point the top guys at ACE who are the top guys at the biggest clubs realise that Team Random is a huge threat. **They are an independent team made by players with no club the first successful Chinese team to do so.** As you can see this is now a huge threat to ACE's financial structure. What if Team Random makes bank at TI? Would that encourage all their best players to form their own teams? The best captains are surely more than capable of hiring some caretakers and coaches and now they don't need to give a cut to the club heads on their winnings and streaming contracts. How would these club heads make money then?  That's why they suddenly jumped in and laid out an absolutely bullshit lifetime ban on the wings players weeks after the initial issue. At their meeting that decides the bans neither the wings boss nor the players are present. They don't actually care about the boss' opinions they just want to kill the team. What other sport gives out life bans for player walkouts? Most give no punishment whatsoever because real sport players have legit managers that will protect their rights. In fact there is a rule in the ACE rule book that says if a club does not pay wages for 60 days they will be deregistered from ACE and their deposit with ACE will be used to pay the players which would then invalidate their ban on the players who are now not part of ACE. But of course nobody will remember such rules when it doesn't fit their agenda.  On another note some people in the Chinese community has check the laws and ACE breaks a whole page of laws regarding civil groups/associations including forced membership violation of not-for-profit rules violation of civil rights etc.   &nbsp;   tldr: **ACE is a scum organisation that breaks laws and they only banned wings to keep their unrightful control over their players to milk as cashcows.**  Edit: looks like there are some people who question my post which is fine. I'm not an interested party nor an insider I just get bits and pieces of stuff from internet and formed an opinion. It's definitely not comprehensive and may be erroneous so I welcome all alternative views with facts. ,discussion

What if Drum active had a long CD instead of charges?,self.DotA2,Of late Drum of Endurance has experienced a small decline. If you analyse the item its far from efficient for the stats so in order for it to be worth buying you need to get mileage out of the aura and active which means being grouped up with your team which in turn means pushing and trying to force fights. However the item falls of greatly after about five events since the charges run out. This was fine when those fights had more meaning but now that its less valuable to get towers and kills (at least when you have an advantage) the effective worth of the item is diminished.  What if Drum instead of having 5 charges of active had unlimited uses but also a greatly increased CD (eg. from 30s to 70s)? Would this be a good change for the item which could make it more popular but wouldn't negatively impact the overall game?,discussion

Valve listens to the community: How do you feel about teammatchmaking including rankings?,self.DotA2,In the wake of Dotabuff's intention of tracking actual rankings and the almost immediate response from Valve that seemingly shot down the full potential of the project I was left with the feeling that Valve is taking a lot of precautions to avoid messing up the spirit of teamplay and befriending others all the while ignoring the competitive aspect in the long run. They are basically keeping each single game competitive by ignoring a lot of players needs of longterm stats and ranking. The latter being something most other games do cater to.    I sincerely hope that Valve has something up their sleeve which they most likely do (keeping in mind that the game is still in Beta and Valve is always about the end product seemingly regardless of the time it takes to get there) and that they will ultimately accommodate everyones need and not just those afraid of being scolded by bullies.    *In the meantime* I have a BurNIng desire for them to implement teammatchmaking with added rankings. That would be one way of at least appeasing the competitive souls of those sociable enough to gather a team of five to play against other premade lineups.    Seeing how fast they reacted on the previous matter I thought I'd go out of my way to please my own selfish needs and see what the community thought about it. I figured Reddit would be better for this cause rather than TL.net as everyone is somehow represented on these boards and the userbase is bigger. My ulterior motive is of course that Valve implements this within a weeks time.

Official Midas Mode Community Bounty Suggestions: Day 1,self.DotA2,**Welcome to Midas Mode!**   This is the official thread to submit your bounties for teams to complete to earn themselves additional Moonbucks for the tournament.   Don't know whats going on? [click here!](http://midas.moonduck.tv)  Bounties are created by you to influence the way the pros will approach the game. They can be centered around the draft in game actions anything you can manage to come up with!  **How it works**  we will submit a thread just like this one 24 hours before the start of the next tournament day just like this one. You will have **until the end of the broadcast day** to submit your bounty ideas. (any submitted after the broadcast ends will be ignored please put them in the new thread!) At the beginning of each broadcast day we will announce our **10 chosen bounties** from the previous day.  The teams are given this list and are able to complete any bounty they see fit at any time. If a bounty is completed in game 1 it cannot be completed again for game 2 and 3. However if a bounty is completed in series 1 it is refreshed for series 2.   Special Note: if a bounty is completed the team will receive moon-bucks immediately. If a bounty is completed and the team wins the bounty pays double.   **Tips and Tricks For Creating Successful Bounties**  Here are some guidelines to have the best chance at having your bounty selected. By all means feel free to not follow these suggestions but these are the general things we will be looking for.   1. Make your bounty easy to quantify and observe. We must award Moonbucks for the bounties completion so we need to make sure we can know for sure that a bounty was completed both intentionally and completely .   *Example* Bad Bounty: Kill Roshan without clicking off it once you click on it (this bounty is confusing and very hard for us to check to ensure that it was completed till after the match)  Good Bounty: Deny an Aegis (this is easy to identify its either they deny it or not despite the circumstance).  Great Bounty: A hero with the Aegis in their inventory must die in the enemy fountain. (creative easy to identify and would be fun to watch teams attempt to do).   2. Be Creative and make it entertaining. we dont want to do the same bounty twice and we dont want bounties that are similar to older bounties or are just boring for our spectators to watch.   Bad bounty: Play a 120 minute game (the only way this will happen is if one team is stomping then makes the game last super long. no one at home wants to watch this and the players dont want to do this)  Good Bounty: Win in under 20 minutes (one team will attempt to end as fast as possible and the other team wont want to gg out in fear of giving the enemy the bounty. This creates fun and interesting game-play for us to watch)  Great bounty: Win a Game without losing a tower (fun interesting game-play which creates a creative new meta for a certain game and would be exciting to watch).   3. Hedge your Bets. Each day we will select some bounties that can be completed in the draft some that must be done in game some that will require you to win and some that can be done even if you lose. If there is a day without many draft bounties think of a fun one to suggest and visa versa. We will be looking for at least one of each.   **Follow these simple guidelines and you may just see your favorite pro player attempting to complete your bounty!** Was your bounty not picked? Well you can try again the next day and make a new one as well. There is no limit to how many bounties you can submit.   Happy Contract writing we at Midas Mode cant wait to see what you come up with!    ,discussion
Do you think valve should implement Prime Matchmaking?,self.DotA2,Valve recently added Prime Matchmaking in CSGO allowing for accounts to be synced up with a users phone. This allows for a person to sync one account per phone.  This has caused from my experience an overall better matchmaking experience. This avoids smurfs purchased accounts and griefers.  Do you think Dota could use this as well? Do you think it will have if at all an effect on matchmaking?  Edit: Thanks for all the discussions guys! Its definitely opened my eyes to many different situations and how all of this can effect Dota and its community in both positive and negative ways.,discussion

Patch waiting room.,self.DotA2,This is a post where you can vent your frustration over not receiving the upcoming patch yet. Feel free to talk about what content you hope to see in the game what the new heroes might be like etc.  I personally hope that Sir Pangolin gets a Q much like Troll's except it changes his main attribute instead of being ranged/melee. His W and E would be an active and a passive which are different for each attribute.  **EDIT:** Apparently there has been a leak about heroes getting 5 talents (instead of 4) and an Aghs rework (with every missing hero being given an upgrade). The Aghs rework is interesting and frightening at the same time. Reducing its cost or increasing its benefits (stats wise) could make it a much more popular item. (That's an Alch buff for you.)  **EDIT2:** This thread wasn't started because there was information about the patch coming soon. It's precisely because we have no idea that there's a waiting room.,discussion

7 Reasons why an in-client community guild system is exactly the thing DotA needs right now.,self.DotA2,1: DotA has become an increasingly team-oriented experience. Playing solo has become less and less fun because you're dealing with 9 random factors that have a huge influence on your game. A guild system would provide a way for people to finally find others to consistently play with lowering this feeling of randomness and helplessness.  2: Guilds offer a wide array of services that normal MM can't. Things like role-based partying leaderboards small tourneys guild matchmaking etc.  3: A stronger sense of community. People are much more likely to become attached to their guilds than they are to the game itself.  4: More competitive games both within the guild as well as guild vs. guild. People can finally form 5 man teams and try out the strategies/playstyles they see the pros doing.  5: Potential for pro-scene growth. If properly run and implemented Guilds can offer a reliable way for players to get noticed and gain respect as they are smaller communities that get to see first-hand a player's/team's skill.  6: Growth for other aspects of the game such as Custom Games. Guild members can advertise their custom games among their guilds and guilds can organize players for them.   7: Less toxicity. Players are held accountable for their actions in guilds because they're playing with similar people who can remember their actions.   Let me know if you have any other ideas to add.  ,discussion

Team Secrets Pugna just failed a gank on an SF due to a targeting bug,self.DotA2,Twitch clip: https://clips.twitch.tv/SmokyFantasticDoveOpieOP  **Edit:** In-game perspective: https://youtu.be/6nmx_pcggBk  ---  Ethereal units have a lower targeting priority than non-ethereal units that are close to them which causes the ethereal unit to not be targeted by a spell/item despite trying to target it **(This apparently only applies to quick-cast targeting)**.  The non-ethereal unit that is next to it will be targeted instead.  This led to the Pugna targeting the Earth Shaker instead of the SF despite just having dagoned the SF (an item that cannot target allies) and thus not needing to move the mouse cursor to follow up with a Life Drain.  This cost them the shakers life and the gank (SF survived ES died pugna had to retreat on low HP).  **Dev forum thread that (also) deals with this:** https://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=266826,bug

Large Post Of Bugs In 7.00,self.DotA2,"EDIT: *Updated with the recent patches*  This is an updated collection of bugs  that I have encountered ingame and/or read on /r/dota2.  ____  #General    * **[Unable to put items into sticky buy](https://gfycat.com/UnfortunateTestyBighornsheep)**  * Tidehunter's Anchor Smash Slardar's Slithereen CrushBristleback's Quill SprayAlchemist's Acid SprayDazzle's Poison TouchAll Possible CleavingLone Druid's Spirit Bear entangling clawsRazor's Eye of the stormBeastMaster's Primal Roar and Wild Axes  All these spells deal damage when necrophos is in ghost shroud.They are blocked with Ghost scepter/Decrepify/Ethereal Blade.  Some spells are blocked with Ghost Shroud:Phantom Assasin's Stifling DaggerMonkey King's Boundless StrikeJuggernaut's Omnislash.  * [Techies can stack proximity mines if his cast range is larger than 400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQnct5w9M8g)  * [Kinetic Gem Trapper's Treachery not working.](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=275337)  * The Crow's Feet kinetic gem doesn't work with the Ripper's Reel.  * If Chen uses Holy Persuasion on an enemy HoD creep and then Chen uses his own HoD on another creep the former enemy HoD creep (now owned by Chen with Holy Persuasion) dies.  * If You wait too long to pick a hero after draft in Captains mode. Draft screen will not go away.(Reconnecting or even restarting dota won't fix it.)  * If you open the shop at side shop and then teleport somewhere you can't buy items in base until you open and reclose the shop because it says you are not by the sideshop even when the item isn't bought at the sideshop.   * Lina's Fiery Soul description is missing the 10 seconds duration.  * Lina's level 25 talent. It says ""firey souls"" instead of ""fiery"".   * When buying items through autobuy or using shift+click to add them to the queue it ignores items you acquired through Disassemble. Whether combining is unlocked or not it doesn't matter so if you use the autobuy ( right click ) or buy the items in the queue you will waste gold buying another duplicate of an item from the recipe you already have.  * You can not buy items if you click spammed buy/sell on strategy screen and hit the game's item limit.  * [Neutral creep spawn outside of camp.](https://gfycat.com/ElectricKindDassie)  * CTRL clicking Remote mines no longer selects all remote mines visible on the screen. Previously CTRL clicking a single remote mine on the ground would select all nearby mines that were in vision of your screen.  * Force Staff cancels Blast Off on a mid-air Techies  * [Magnus skewer can still port people back to his fountain. Apparently it's an old bug from 6.87 and is related to Slark.](https://gfycat.com/DampHeartfeltAmurstarfish)  * Live tournament matches lag when heroes use illusion based skills/items like Manta Illusion rune or Disruption.  * When getting Level 25 Talent on Huskar that increases Ult Cast Range the skill loses the cast range indicator when trying to use it.  * [Oftentimes numbers on the new HUD turn into ellipses instead of being truncated or rounded. This is incredibly irritating when it happens to movespeed because movespeed info is not displayed anywhere else.](http://i.imgur.com/hwle1ww.jpg)   * Tinker's Aghanim Scepter Laser bounces to Visage's Familiars  * Default cosmetics still sometimes do not load correctly and the hero only has their base model(Naked Monkey King).  * If you level up a skill at 16 you can't get your ulti at 17 as Meepo but if you don't level up anything at 16 you can skill your ulti at 17.  * [Sometimes the item icons in quickbuy is replaced with a black box.](https://i.imgur.com/PIfT08V.png)  * [The Ancient Prowler Shaman's Desecrate debuff states that it also slows movespeed but it does not.](http://i.imgur.com/sY10yOm.png)  * Accepting a game while spectating another that is in pick/strategy phase crashes the game.  * [Since 7.00 update 3rd level of ulti is available at lvl 18 but scoreboard shows it at lvl 17.](https://i.imgur.com/lj0hKscl.png)  * [These are not working in Dota TV and Replay.](http://imgur.com/UK1XyH4)  * There is no re-roll buttons in all pick or random draft (non-ranked)  * Hover-popping: Display of heroes buggy after a match. [[video](https://gfycat.com/EmbarrassedRichChevrotain)]   * ""Select Hero"" doesn't center camera on hero: Have ""Hold Select Hero to Follow"" turned on and while using it  simultaneously drag the Camera Grip to pan the display. After you've released everything tapping ""Select Hero"" will not center the display on the hero but instead remembers the camera-grip offset. (This bug emerged just before 700. Does not seem intentional [flickers briefly to the expected location] and is mildly infuriating when  trying to quickly find your hero)  * In Hero Demo mode various non-hero units display a talent tree when the area is hovered e.g. Pugna's Nether ward  * The end of the restock timer seems to be off by a second  * Demo Options appears on top of the Shop menu when map is on right. (Would clearly be better with the Z-order swapped)  * All-bot games are rampant and are even making it to the top results of the ""Watch Live"" screen  * [A problem with buying items for Axe spawned using spawn enemy.] (http://i.imgur.com/wmKA9pE.jpg)  * Templar Assassin's Trap's Tooltip states that the trap slows by *""up to 50%.""* -- Traps slow up to 60%  * Templar Assassin's Trap's Slow Tooltip has the same problem.   * Templar Assassin's Traps visually only slow 30%. (If a hero with 300 MS gets slowed by a max charged trap their MS will appear to be 210.) I believe this is just a visual bug.  * Tooltip shows Centaur aghs damage reduction being increased by spell amp. It is not.  * When quick-buying Power Treads the Belt of Strength is not removed from buying Band of Elvenskin or Robe of the Magi.  * Dragon Knight's Stun range indicator does not change when Dragon Knight enters Dragon Form. Dragon Form changes the cast range but in order to maximize this you will be stunning units outside the range indicator.  * Unsure if fixed yet: If you spectate a ranked match when the game ends you will see the players' view (showing hidden stats such as MMR). If you just open a random replay these stats are hidden.  * Typing for heroes on the hero tab is highly inconsistent. If I type R-I Timbersaw (aka Rizzrack) will show up. If I type L-A-N Templar Assassin (aka Lanaya) will not show up. Mortred does not work and Mirana's names do not work. On the other hand Meepo's does work and Medusa's does work. Haven't tested too many heroes on this.  * Phantom Lancer can not select illusions during Doppelganger. If you use the skill then issue a move command Phantom Lancer will receive it the illusions will not. This makes it apparent which one is real.  * KDA is overlapping demo mode tools.  * You cannot edit the ""Popular Items"" menu anymore. (It used to be editable just like a normal guide.)  * In some cases buying a large item will result in buying too many components. I can't give much more detail than this but I went to secret shop with 4 OoV spam clicked skadi got 4 skadis **and one ulti orb and point booster** I did not get the other point booster or OoV.  * Buying an item such as Bloodstone or Octarine Core with brown boots may result in building arcanes.  * When viewing an enemy Invoker the current level of spell stat (like Deafening Blast damage) will be highlighted. This reveals what level Invoker's orb is at.  * Juggernaut ward can be very hard to click if under the hero. This is mostly just a problem with bots.  * You cannot drag an item from stash to shop (to sell). You can drag an item from your inventory/backpack to sell just fine.  * Luna's Eclipse's Alt Text says `There is a .6 seconds gap .3 seconds with scepter.` Should say `0.6` `0.3`.  * Hurricane Pike does not change a hero's Attack Acquisition range. For example if you Hurricane Pick an ethereal unit you will not begin to auto attack them until the ethereal wears off. If you A-click the ground you will auto attack the closest enemy within acquisition range. If the enemy is outside your normal attack acquisition range you will not attack the enemy (despite having infinite range). If you simply click the enemy you will attack them again.  * Manta illusions seem to lose invulnerability later than the main hero. You can for example hit the main hero with Slardar crush without hitting the illusions. Also if the hero and illusions are within acquisition range you will auto attack the hero every time.  * Shrine range display disappears when activated.   *  if you have components for an item in your inventory and enough money to finish it the item is not highlighted in the shop.    *  sometimes when you try to select another unit it keeps selecting your unit and you can't see the items the other hero have   * Centaur Ult damage is amped by the allys damage amp the tooltip shows Centaurs (may or may not be intended).  * If arcana is equipped during the street fighter VS screen TB would just stand idle-ly there whilst without arcana he is shown crossing his swords.   * When your ally picked tb without an arcana and you swap with him (you have arcana equipped) your hero will be shown using your ally's set(intended) however your illusion will have arcana equipped and they wont have attack animations.   * Infused raindrop does not state whether the 50-120 value is before or after reductions. It is before.  * Phantom Assassin's dagger does not show cast range in description. This is a problem as leveling the ability changes the cast range.  * When you have an item in quick-buy you cannot press the hotkey to buy that item; it seems to always buy a TP scroll instead.  * Zeus's Level 25 talent upgrade says that it increases static field damage by 1.5% but it shows 1% increase in the skill description.  * [Nature's Prophet's Sprout trees trees from iron branch and the trees monkey king can transfrom into are not enlarged in showcase mode.](http://i.imgur.com/nvyHrsn.png)  * You can no longer alt+click on enemies buffs/debuffs in the side unit panel and you can't see their stats.  * [Level 25 talents that give charges to non-charge abilities (gyro aa) use level 1 cooldown for charge recover time for rest of game after 1 recover.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX3Ouejny3Q)  * Gyrocopter's Homing missile talent says +3 homing missile but the total is 3 instead of 4. Also no cooldown showed for homing missile if you chose that talent.  * [First blood kills Camps stacked stats error](http://imgur.com/u2gBS42)  * if Weaver swarms your Astral Spirit as well as Elder Titan after Spirit comes back you'll have two of the bugs from the swarm on you.  * Familiars don't display any silence icons when silenced  * Familiars get stuck on the edge of the map and require stone form to get them out.  * [The courier also does not have an upgrade ability in shop](http://imgur.com/a/wM9Oi)  * Aether lens increases the cast range of boundless strike but not the actual distance the staff hits meaning targeting someone with it at max distance won't actually hit them.  * Tree dance only applies the highlighting once it doesn't highlight trees that regrow after entering a tree and it doesn't reapply highlighting if cast range changes.  * Tree dance highlights the tree you're in until you try to jump to it then it's correctly unhighlighted.  * Iron Talon: Trying to use its active ability on ancient creeps gives the error ""can only be used on trees and wards"" which is the quelling blade error message. It should simply say ""cannot be used on ancient creeps"".  * Visage: If you level up your ultimate your currently summoned familiars should level up after using stone form but they don't. (This one is pretty big considering the cooldown is so long and you don't wanna waste it just to get lvl 2 familiars for example)  * Familiars auto attack. (They should not auto attack by default)  * [Status effects do not show the green or red circle around them or their duration.](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/197428545633687522/72DB5884F94C9500A3D1229F0B2B12028547C0A3/)  * Showcase mode toggle button displays your hero in showcase mode if clicked on a portrait of a different allied unit.  * If a Techies affected by Slark's pounce uses Blast Off and before he impacts the ground the pounce debuff ends no Blast Off damage is dealt to techies and no silence/damage in the radius.  * [Overlapping hud with control groups](http://imgur.com/a/2Kdgt)  * [If you buy Dagon recipe Lv.4 Quick buy slot will be reset after courier sent it to you.](https://i.redd.it/sqllydnm9o4y.gif)  * Wraith King's Vampric Aura lifesteals incorrect values it should lifesteal 10/15/20/25 (30/35/40/45)% but actually lifesteals at 7.7/13.7/19.7/25.7 (27.7/33.7/39.7/45.7)%. It also applies lifesteal BEFORE armour and attack reductions for allies of Wraith King but does so AFTER armour and attack reductions on Wraith King himself. Finally if Rubick steals Vampiric Aura and dies while he still has the skill stolen and steals it again he and his allies gain 2x the benefit while the skill is toggled. Morphling's Hybrid appears to also have the same bug  * [""Display Network Information"" doesnt show in game](http://i.imgur.com/OLSwNAI.png)  * [Heroes killed by Techies' mines while under WK's Aghs Aura is still counted as a deny.](https://gfycat.com/ShabbyDesertedAcaciarat)  * Everytime Ancient Apparition appears from the fog he keeps on shattering and this is super annoying same bug happens with Enigma's black hole and wisp.  * Venomancer and Shadow Shaman's wards do not keep their hotkey binds.   * [Can't connect to AD matches.](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=274471)  * [There is a missing HERO_NAME string in the hero stats page ""Most recent 20 games"" section(above the win loss sequence)](https://i.redditmedia.com/NbSYEOFSrHJm0KDr--lhswosL5uxZfBtns0uC7WR96w.jpg?w=1024&s=df9ceb47e1ecac1f557f9c25321e9057)   * [Batrider's ""Mask of the Marauding Pyro"" has clipping issues.](http://i.imgur.com/hGG42Xo.png)  * If you use Legacy Keys on Invoker (legacy keys is irrelevant here but I'll mention it anyway) and rebind Chat Wheel to some other key (I have it to F3) and you press Y (default chat wheel key) it will still bring up chat wheel even though it is not bound to that. Same thing happens with inventory. If you press Z the game will use the item in the first inventory slot (I think it's the first one) regardless of your keybinds.  * You can see if an enemy places a ward in FoG because the ward disappears in their inventory. (If he is still selected while he's going to FoG )   * When Monkey King is channelling Primal Spring Chronosphere doesn't stop him.  * [You can't swap heroes if you buy courier during strategy time because courier is auto used.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5iw75t/you_cant_swap_heroes/ )  * You can't commend effigies anymore.  * Rubick is visible while on the tree with the tree dance ability stolen from Monkey King if you are close to the tree.  * Rubick does not get the flying vision or indicator for trees he can jump to he can also use Tree Dance on the ground even while damaged in the normal damage window.  * When watching a game if you try to press buttons like ""Y"" for net worth nothing will happen and you have to click on it to change.  * You get 4 commends instead of one every time someone commends you.  * Reverse camera grip has been broken for years. It doesn't root the cursor to the ground like standard camera grip so it feels janky and gives you way less range of movement than standard grip.  ___  #Ability Draft  * In Ability Draft heroes sometimes retain their original ultimate allowing for the hero to have 2 ultimate abilities.  * Zeus and treant retain their ultimates if they select another ult totalling 5 abilities. hitting r will activate their normal while the bonus ultimate needs to be clicked on directly.  * Nyx assassin gains burrow when purchasing an aghs but it will not activate. also causes your current ultimate to take the 4th slot and require clicking to activate. ultimate hotkey will not work after purchasing.  * Keyboard hotkeys do NOT work in draft screen (no voice chat impossible to draft if you cant communicate)  * Tome of knowledge XP increase per Tome used does NOT work  * Couriers and wards regularly error out.  * Using metamorphosis in ability draft does not give you extra range even on terrorblade.   ___  #Arc Warden Bugs by TheZett   * [Eul's Scepter bug regarding Spell Immune Clones](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=272859&p=1407179#post1407179)   * [Tempest Double gold bounty is AoE if Tempest dies to Creeps/Tower](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=271178)  * [Magnetic Field evasion malfunctioning](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=266372&p=1391867#post1391867)  * [Tempest Double doesnt grant post-humous EXP to main Warden (other summons do!)](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=266732&p=1392801#post1392801)  * [Stat stealing Mechanic isnt consistant (OD/Slark) regarding Hero Clones](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=266734&p=1392804#post1392804)   ____  #**[DotaTV and replay 7.00 bugs](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=274309)** (link to dev forum with screenshots)  * No single HUD console command currently is working in live games and replays it's also impossible to hide different parts of HUD: map heroes picked inventory.

Enough is enough we need IO fixed because I'm running into so many problems playing him every time. It's ruining everyone's game with an IO involved and I feel like it shouldn't be ignored any longer.,self.DotA2,Edit: Hey /r/all if anyone that doesn't know what Dota 2 is please check [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/wiki/faq#wiki_what_are_some_basic_tips_when_starting_to_play.3F) out  After all the post 7.00 posts have cooled down I think this is an appropriate time to bring this issue back to light.  It was so ridiculous looking at all the new changes in the 7.00 update and not seeing any crucial IO fixes pop up ONCE. Many of us IO pickers feel completely neglected and to be honest I feel pretty butthurt about all this since many other heroes are getting the fixes they need but these IO game-breaking problems have persisted since IO's release.   ---  #Spell Interactions:  I'll start off with the most serious problem IO's particle effects while interacting with other hero spells are **very** broken for example when Pugna decriptifies IO instead of looking green IO completely disappears... This visual information is very essential to the game and I don't want to completely rely on looking down at my buffs/debuffs bar instead of my actual game when playing IO because the actual game contains much more visual information than the debuff bar at the bottom of the screen (obviously) to help people know the importance of this problem I detailed all 42 of these bugs in a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BIyCijXuTX3H8CSFlO2ZBQdbo1W-21OTmVBmjaHOIds/edit?usp=sharing) made by testing every single tedious spell interaction from every hero when coming into contact with IO  I hope people who pick heroes other than IO can sympathize with me on this because IO is the only hero that has spell interaction bugs and if you think that this lack of visual information is not a big deal then by this logic we should also be okay with Dota 2 becoming a plain board game right?  The amazing /u/Toyoka commented on this explaining the cause of this problem and their possible solutions to me here is what he had to say:  >Most of these issues are caused by Io being entirely particle-based. Particles are very finicky when it comes to applying them over each other. It looks like some of the strobing/flickering that goes on is caused due to [z-fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting) because Io's particles are trying to render over other things while effect particles from spells are also trying to do the same. It's not easy to fix but it is doable. I experienced this myself while working on an [Io set of mine](https://streamable.com/r5je) and the best way to solve it is to just balance out how the particles are rendered. I do sincerely hope Valve does some work on Io it would make people like you and me happy :)  #Relocate Timer:  This is a problem that has been the ultimate cause of my death countless of times it's almost impossible to pull off a glimmer cape TP back after relocating after the timer without timing it right when you get hit by [Monkey King](http://imgur.com/a/sUG7b). What also makes it worse is the buffs bar doesn't show the [timer](http://imgur.com/a/bUwm3) and that **really** grinds my gears.  /u/Toyoka explained the cause of this bug and suggested a temporary solution but I don't think that's enough for a huge game like Dota 2: Edit: (KINDA OUTDATED)  >Yea this is an issue with the particle's alignment and could easily be fixed by a dev by adjusting its offset by a few units. One way to remedy this yourself (albeit not a permanent solution of course) is to move your camera up slightly when relocating so the timer is more visible since it's visibility is partially dependent on the camera's angle. The timer in general is sort of a bad implementation in my opinion; for example it completely gets wonky when in showcase view as it's meant to be seen from the default camera angle.  ---  I know it sounds very cliche but fuck karma and fuck popularity while they are nice things that I like to have and enjoy; the sole reason of making this post is in the hopes that one day we'll wake up to a brand new Dota 2 update that fixes these bugs and doesn't make us feel like we're at a disadvantage in every single game as IO us the IO picking community and many others have banded together before for #GiffIoArcana and it was a very valiant and beautiful effort but this time it's not for a cosmetic purpose it's for maintaining our reputation as the best MOBA game in our time and to proudly say that we need our playable characters to be fully functional. In spirit of reincarnating a small scale and short lived hashtag of comments on my previous not very well known IO bug posts: **#PRAYFORIO**  Thank you for taking the time to read my huge wall of text about IO bugs but if you didn't here's a **TL;DR:**  IO has many bugs that are always seen in games with IOs in them that drastically affect the game and these bugs need to be fixed ASAP. Thanks for caring anyways!  *I'll relocate out now*  Edit: Thanks to everyone who helped this get visibility I hope that by next patch this problem will only be a memory.,bug

Proof that the Song of the Siren + Meteor Hammer combo is not working 100% of the time,self.DotA2,There have been some debates on whether this combo always works or not. Here is a definite answer to that:  No it is not 100% reliable and does not work consistently.   **TL;DR: The combo sometimes does not hit every unit within the area for reasons  beyond the player's control. Factors that seemingly make the combo fail at times are: Game time (meaning which game tick the combo lands on) and amount of units on the map. Unit creation order may play a role as well.**   Why is this?  Well everyone who uses the combo (probably) knows that the song's linger time and the meteor landing time are the same: 0.5 seconds. If you do the combo it's 2 things happening on the same tick. There is literally 0 delay between the song ending and the meteor hitting.  And this is what makes the combo not 100% reliable. I cannot tell you why it happens but sometimes the orders get swapped around on these frame-perfect events if the order is not determined by some factor (e.g. by the spell codes like deso which will always place its debuff before the attack damage is applied both on the same frame). Since these are 2 spells being used together there is no such factor determining the order.  The strange part is if you have multiple enemies within the meteor area sometimes only some of them may get hit. This I cannot explain at all. It just shows us that it goes through every unit one by one but for some reason swaps the order around for some units.  In the video you can see how the combo only hits 1 out of the 5 enemy nagas but when the enemies do it they hit 3 out of 5 nagas. After I spawned the naga illus it suddenly hit every single one of them.  #[video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOikEJrjUCs),bug
ACTUAL list of unfixed bugs from 6.87 (including some abusable stuff),self.DotA2,"As expected u/TheZett only covered Arc Warden bugs. There are more bugs which spawned with 6.87 and most of them are covered here (except for AW bugs). Some of them are abusable (although not gamebreaking like the infinite axe taunt)  This turned out longer than expected. Whatever.  Edit: Also something something Decrepify Tombstone not working something.   ---  ---  #**Untouchable malfunction caused by canceling attacks**  This is not a 6.87 bug but it is abusable so here it goes: When you directly target Enchantress with an attack order and then cancel that order so that your hero starts automatically attacking Enchantress it will not be slowed by Untouchable and attack at normal speed. There are 2 ways to do this. Either have auto-attack set to ""always"" and simply press Stop once during the ordered attack. Or you have auto-attack off and give your unit an attack-ground order during the ordered attack.  **Current:** Untouchable does not slow when auto-attacking ench after a forced attack.  **Expected:** Untouchable always slows no matter how the attack started.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAYQ2mPb5bE  #This is not properly fixed yet it still is abusable like before.  ----  ~~#**Echo Sabre always grants its effects on the first hit after picking it up**~~  ~~This is heavily abusable. Whenever your Echo Sabre enters your inventory (be it freshly bought or just dropped on the ground and then picked upa gain) it will apply its attack speed and slow on your next attack regardless of its cooldown.~~  ~~**Current:** Echo Sabre always applying its effects on the first attack after pickup.~~  ~~**Expected:** Echo Sabre only applies its effects upon succesfully hitting an enemy.~~  ~~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2Qh5XeFl7w~~  ~~Besides the enchantress example it can be abused in every situation. Whenever it is save to do so you can drop and quickly pick it up to get 2 very fast attacks instead of 1 normal speed attack and 1 very fast attack.~~  Fixed  ----  #**Fury Swipes damage not reflected/spread by Blade Mail/Dispersion/Fatal Bonds**  For some reason damage dealt by Fury Swipes is ignored by spells which ignore damage which have the no-reflection flag.  **Current:** Damage dealt by Fury Swipes is ignored by Blade Mail/Fatal Bonds/Dispersion.  **Expected:** Like before 6.87 Fury Swipes damage is fully affected by all 3.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf2J6tcqCbM  ----  ~~#**Arctic Burn doesn't toggle itself off when dropping the aghs**~~  ~~This can be abused in the late game. When you buy aghs toggle Arctic Burn on and then drop the aghs (e.g. put in stash) Arctic Burn will remain toggled on until you die. This basically enables WW to have 6 items + an aghs effect in the late game (effectively 7 slots).~~  ~~**Current:** Arctic Burn stays toggled on after dropping aghs.~~  ~~**Expected:** Arcitc Burn toggles itself off as soon as aghs gets dropped.~~  ~~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD4Pm4CW8kc~~  Fixed  ----  ~~#**Aghs upgraded Arctic Burn procs stuff like magic wand**~~  ~~The aghs upgrade turns Arctic Burn into a toggle spell. As a toggle spell it should not proc magic wand/stick/arcane curse/last word and other spells which react on spell-cast. As of now it does as the only toggle spell in the game. It should proc them when not upgraded.~~  ~~**Current:** Toggling Arctic Burn on/off procs on-cast effects.~~  ~~**Expected:** Arctic Burn should not proc on-cast effects when upgraded like other toggle spells. It should only proc them when not upgraded.~~  ~~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rnqTxEC5-k~~  Fixed  ----  ~~#**Tidebringer's cast range is still 128 instead of 150**~~  ~~Melee attack range was increased to 150. But Tidebringer's cast range is still 128 so when you use it manually Kunkka will have to move a bit closer to the target.~~  ~~**Current:** Tidebringer cast range is 128.~~  ~~**Expected:** Tidebringer cast range is 150.~~  ~~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm1lMyBaDxw~~  Fixed except for the range indicators (all 3 still show 128 instead of 150)  Also besides Tidebringer **the range indicator of Walrus Punch (and Walrus Kick) are not updated**. Although their cast range was updated to 150 the indicator still shows 128.  ---- ~~#**Walrus Punch lost its True Strike in 6.87**~~  ~~Just like Silver Edge which was fixed quickly Walrus Punch has lost its True Strike. This hurts Tusk a lot against heroes like PA making him unable to deal with them like before.~~  ~~**Current:** Walrus Punch does not have True Strike and can miss.~~  ~~**Expected:**  Walrus Punch has True Strike and cannot miss.~~  ~~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjHjT9FJZ9U~~  This got fixed  ----  #**Hurricane Pike's buff does not update properly on re-cast**  When you re-cast Hurricane Pike while having the buff from a previous cast the buff duration gets refreshed. But the number of limitless range attacks is not refreshed and the target is not updated either.  So let's say you cast it on hero A and make 2 attacks on it. You now have 2 unlimited range attacks against that target left. Now recast it on hero B. You still have 2 unlimited range attacks left against target A and have 0 unlimited range attacks against target B. All the recast did is refresh the previous buff without updating it at all.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nFjD4rYIWI  **Current:** Recasting Pike only refreshes buff duration  **Expected:** Recasting Pike refreshes duration updates target for unlimited range attacks and resets number of attacks to 4.  ----  #**Hurricane Pike (and Force Staff) pushes units too far**  According to tooltips and changelogs Hurricane Pike should push units 450 range away from each other. However it actually pushes them 525 range away from each other.  http://i.imgur.com/az4jOSK.jpg  **Current:** Hurricane Pike pushes caster & enemy units 525 range.  **Expected:** Hurricane Pike pushes caster & enemy units 450 range.  Same applies to targeting self/allies or using Force Staff. They should push for 600 range but actually push 650 range.  http://i.imgur.com/wvg5WUn.jpg  **Current:** Force Staff and Hurricane Pike push units 650 range.  **Expected:** Force Staff and Hurricane Pike push units 600 range.  ----  #**Hurricane Pike places its range buff on melee casters**  **Edit:** As pointed out by u/utumo  this is actually a good thing for morphing heroes who can switch between ranged/melee (troll lone dk terrorblade) so maybe this is a good thing and shouldn't be changed.   Just a minor visual/information issue. When the item is used by a melee hero or reflected by a melee hero it should not place the unlimited range buff on them since they cannot make use of it anyway.  **Current:** Hurricane Pike places its unlimited range buff on melee casters.  **Expected:** Hurricane Pike does not place its unlimited range buff on melee casters.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leKkdr4MBA8  ----  #**Desolator/Blight Stone place their debuff on ethereal units**  I checked *all* other attack modifier and deso/blight are the only ones which do this.  Since 6.87 attack projectiles no longer apply secondary effects (like debuffs or extra magical damage or whatever) on their targets when they connect with it while it is in ethereal state. Howeve Desolator and Blight Stone still place their debuffs even when their target turned ethereal.  **Current:** Desolator/Blight Stone apply their debuff when connecting with ethereal targets.  **Expected:** Desolator/Blight Stonedo not apply their debuff when connecting with ethereal targets.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t1KyB3zCgc  ----  #**Bane's Nightmare broken interaction with dispels**  Since 6.87 Nightmare is dispellable. However there are 2 issues  **1.** Nightmare's sleep effect is *always* placed as a debuff no matter if the target is an ally or enemy. This means when you face an enemy Bane you cannot use your purge to remove the defensive Nightmare which defeats the purpose of turning the spell dispellable. Strangely the invulnerability effect works properly (buff when cast on allies debuff when cast on enemies).  http://i.imgur.com/W1mXkUC.png  **Current**: Nightmare is always placed as a debuff regardless of who is targeted.  **Expected**: Nightmare is placed as a buff when casting on allies and debuff when on enemies.  **2.** Nightmare's invulnerability effect is unpurgeable  This means even when you purge the Nightmare off you will still be invulnerable for the 1 second. This matters since Diffusal Blade and Satyr Purge can target invulnerable units  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3qEGaSfqI0  ----  ~~#**Recasting Pipe of Insight (or Flame Guard) doesn't reset damage block capacity**~~  ~~Since Pipe of Insight no longer has a stack restriction this got relevant (it always was somewhat relevant for Ember Spirit).~~  ~~When you cast Pipe and have it block some magical damage and then recast it while still having the previous buff it only refreshes the duration but does not set its damage block capacity back. Same goes for Ember Spirit's Flame Guard.~~  ~~Hood of Defiance's active ability had the same issue as it was added but it was fixed. Pipe and Flame Guard were not fixed.~~  ~~**Current:** Recasting Pipe/Flame Guard only refreshes buff duration.~~  ~~**Expected:** Recasting them also resets their damage block capacity.~~  ~~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_E529J4tW0~~  Fixed  ----  #**Drunken Brawler's ensured crit gets wasted on attack-canceling**  This does not happen always. It happens when you cancel your attacks few times quickly. The ensured crit should only get used up if you succesfully land an attack (it already ignores missed attacks). This used to work fine before 6.87.  **Current:** Canceling attacks may cause the ensured crit to get wasted  **Expected:** Ensured crit only goes on cooldown when it actually succesfully hits an enemy  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuB74uitV1k  You can see that the icon updates properly (red streak disappears upon succesful hit) but you can see that the attack does not crit.  ----  #**Gyro's side gunner ignores fade time/fade delay of invis spells**  This prevents Gyro from turning invisible with Moonlight Shadow as the gunner's attacks will reset the fade delay. It also is abusable with Shadow Blade. When timing Shadow Blade so that the gunner attacks during the fade time the attack will apply the backstab without using up the invis. So you can backstab a 2nd time with one cast by breaking the invis with a regular attack.  **Current:** The side gunner keeps attacking during the fade time or fade delay on invis spells  **Expected:**The gunner should not attack during fade times/delays (nerfing solution) or the gunner's attack should not reset fade delays (buffing solution)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ3nobWWGAg  ----  ~~#**Spirit Siphon's sound and visual effect do not match its duration**~~  ~~The visual effect and sound effect of Spirit Siphon still last only 4 seconds (original duration as the spell was added). By now its duration was increased to 6 but the visuals/sounds were never updated. So 1/3 of its duration the spell is basically invisible.~~  ~~**Current:** Spirit Siphon visuals/sounds last 4 seconds.~~  ~~**Expected:** Spirit Siphon visuals/sounds last the full 6 seconds.~~  ~~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLthnABeWzs~~  ~~Also **Spirit Siphon's visual effect draws to the center of the map** when having no vision over the target.

Ritsu strikes again - DODGING EXPLOIT,self.DotA2,"Hey reddit i just made an account to post this because what happened with this ""pro"" player was enfuriating from my point of view.  I maybe should introduce myself I am a 6.8k player atm [pics or didnt happen](http://imgur.com/XmYCtOZ)  I was queueing for an hour long a solo ranked game queue popped got into a game yada yada yada. I always kind of check who am i playing against hence I recognized one of the players I was going to play against was Ritsu (a pro player playing for Dragneel atm that has recieved a lot of accusations for: stalking beesa's sister [showing scrim picks to other teams on skype](https://twitter.com/EternaLEnVy1991/status/663175361790898177)  etc) So everyone was loading into the game aswell as Ritsu and I realised that he dced from it after few seconds of being loaded into it. That's fine I have done it to avoid a headache once in a while. The problem is that he EXPLOITED a bug to not get the qeue ban time and keep queueing and he can do it over and over again until he likes his team. I got him in my qeues like 3 times and he wasted like 2 hours of my time queueing abusing this exploit because I kept getting into a game against him over and over.  [WHAT DID HE DO?](/tg) : he timed (chronometer or smth) the amount of time he was dced for and came back at the very moment the game goes into that FAILED (in red) phase where u wait 3 seconds before you get back into a qeue. The game dealt with this like if a player didnt load and starts the queue again for all the 9 players and gives a cooldown to the player/s that didnt load in this case its for the 10 players because hes exploiting this bug. That way you dont get a cooldown from competitive timer.  [DO I HAVE PROOF?](/tg) : I didnt have proof the first time he did it but then I got in queue against him 2 more times and he did it again so here are some images about it. [qeued against him](http://imgur.com/Uq05s7T)  [moment when he has to RC so that he doesnt get the cooldown](http://imgur.com/r0iqxOZ)  [great conversation with a great human](http://imgur.com/BnxXUhK)  I took this time to create an account and post it because I have played several times with and against this guy in ranked games and hes constantly flaming people being extremely racist (unbelievable) a game ruiner and guess what! now hes a bug exploiter aswell. Hope this guy never gets to play professional dota again he just disgraces everything what a pro player should be in my opinion. Valve please fix this (i also hope u take some actions against the player/s that are abusing the bug) since it is really unfair for every other player that is not abusing it.  TL;DR: ritsu exploited a bug to not get queue time cooldowns after dodging and since hes fucking all my queues (about 2 hrs of time) i took almost the same amount of time to expose him and report a bug.  P.S: i know u know who i am ritsu pls no family stalking xD",bug

Hero1: Everything wrong with Abaddon part 1/2 (a new project of mine going through all heroes listing all bugs and suggesting some QoL improvements),self.DotA2,This is a series I planned some time ago (last year before 7.00 that's why some of the vids have the old HUD) and I think it's time to start it.  Once a week or every 2 weeks I'll make a post focusing on a single hero pointing out every issue I could find (this includes cosmetic items) and also including some suggestions for the hero mainly quality of life stuff and minor possible improvements. -  Since no one is perfect I probably missed some stuff. If you know any other issue about this hero or have an idea for small improvement (not balancing stuff) feel free to post them -  Some of these posts will be split up into multiple ones (like this one) because else they'll get too long. -  #Edit: [Here is part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5sawt1/hero1_everything_wrong_with_abaddon_part_22/)  ---  #Part 1 of 2: Bugs  ##[](/hero-abaddon) Abaddon  * Total number of subjects: 17 * Number of bugs: 8 (this post) * Number of minor issues: 2.5 (next post) * Number of other stuff: 6.5 (next post)  ^^^other ^^^stuff ^^^includes ^^^inconsistencies ^^^inconveniences ^^^and ^^^suggestions  ^^^Bugs ^^^are ^^^sorted ^^^by ^^^order ^^^of ^^^severity.  ---  #1.Borrowed Time scepter upgrade malfunctions and may cause performance issues.  Borrowed Time's scepter upgrade adds an aura to it which lingered for 0.5 seconds on allies. This lingering caused a suicide bug on Abaddon when allies took damage after Borrowed Time expired on him so he took the 50% damage without turning into a heal. To fix this issue the devs set its buff linger duration to 0.  This turns out to be a bad solution because it causes other severe issues:  * The aura's effect may not apply to the hero on several server ticks because of how fast it gets removed again. This means your aghs sometimes does nothing but increase duration! * It spams the heroes with the buff multiple times per tick which may or may not affect performance (I need help checking this) * The buff stays invisible on allies since it never gets the chance to establish due to it being spammed.  Video demos: [aura malfunctioning] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPXrMrzmfzw) [buff spamming] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6pCkcFE27g) and [buff not being visible] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhBdesuiSc4)  Note: None of these existed before its linger duration was set to 0 so it is save to assume that all 3 issues are caused by it.  **Proposed solution:**  * Make the aura use the default 0.5s buff linger duration again * Add codes to Borrowed Time which destroys the modifier_abaddon_borrowed_time_damage_redirect modifier on all affected allied heroes as soon as the borrowed_time modifier disappears on Abaddon  ---  #2. Aphotic Shield malfunction when combined with Borrowed Time aura or Ghostship rum  Aphotic Shield does not block any damage when the unit is also affected by Borrowed Time's aura or by Ghost Ship's rum but it still lose capacity as if it did block.  **Current behavior:** For simplicity's sake let's take a dagon 5 and say it deals 500 damage:  * Dagon 5 alone: 500 damage * Dagon 5 on Aphotic Shield: 300 damage 200 blocked by shield * Dagon 5 on aura/rum: 250 damage 500 reduced by 50% * Dagon5 on shield+aura/rum: still 250 damage? reduced by 50% but shield did nothing and still bursted as if it did  **Expected behavior:** There are 2 options:  * Option 1: damage\*aura/rum-shield = 500\*0.5-200=50 * Option 2: (damage-shield)\*0.5 = 500-200\*0.5 = 150  Option one would be more consistant with Borrowed Time taking priority over Aphotic Shield. In option 2 Aphotic Shield takes priority.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq0WNrG6D_Y) As seen in the vid Living Armor has the same issue.  ---  #3.Aphotic Shield malfunction when combined with Living Armor  Similar to the previous case. When a unit is affected by Aphotic Shield and Living Armor at the same time **this currently happens:**  * Living Armor functions normally blocks damage loses a charge per instance * However Aphotic Shield still loses health as if Living Armor did not block any damage. * To make things worse Aphotic Shield itself does not block any damage while having Living Armor. So it loses health but does nothing.  **Expected happenings:** 2 options again:  * Option 1: Living Armor blocks damage and loses charge Aphotic Shield blocks remaining damage and loses capacity based on how much it blocked. * Option 2: Aphotic Shield blocks first. Living Armor therefore has nothing to block and keeps all its charges until Aphotic Shield is destroyed at which point Living Armor can start blocking.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62mJh6QiLdQ)  ---  #4.Aphotic Shield's visual effect is tiny/invisible on some heroes and units  Aphotic Shield's visual effect size is based on the model. But some model have attachment issues making the bubble extremely small or attach the bubble at bad spots so that it's basically invisible on some heroes and units.  [Here are some examples in a video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHY6Ok2-sc8) showing the worst cases.  **Worst cases are:** Tiny Drow Ranger Broodmother Gyrocopter Riki Viper Weaver Naga Siren burrowed Nyx Assassin Dier Siege Creep Kobold Foreman/Taskmaster Beastmaster's hawk Roshan and Undying Zombie Torsos.  **More bad cases are:** Earthshaker Underlord Undying Phoenix Sand King Ember Spirit Medusa Razor Nyx Oracle Techies Leshrac Ogre Magi and Winter Wyvern.  Wisp also has an issue the shield flickers heavily on it.  [Here is an image showing the shield on all heroes] (http://i.imgur.com/itpbSIT.jpg) including their transformations and [here on all non-hero units] (http://i.imgur.com/gjJpGAA.jpg).  **Proposed fix:** Most of these could be fixed by giving the shield a minimum size. As a comparison Lotus Orb's Echo Shell does not have this issue so maybe the behavior can be copied from there.  ---  #5. Borrowed Time heavy inconsistency upon taking 2 damage instances at once.  Update edit: Mistake on my side this issue does not affect all the named spells. It affects 7 out of them.  It's strange. If you are low enough that damage can auto-trigger Borrowed Time and if you take 2 damage instances at once sometimes Borrowed Time heals from one of them and sometiems it doesn't.  Hard to put into words so [here is an image showing combat logs] (http://i.imgur.com/DY7eI8d.png)  Affected heroes/spells are:  * Ancient Apparition (Chilling Touch + attack damage) * Nyx Assassin (Vendetta + attack damage) * Templar Assassin (Meld + attack damage) * Batrider (Sticky Napalm + any other damage from bat) * Outworld Devourer (Arcane Orb + attack damage) * Storm Spirit (Overload + attack damage) * Bounty Hunter (Shadow Walk + attack damage)  Other spells which deal 2 instances of damage at once are:  * Earthshaker (Aftershock + Fissure or Echo Slam) * Spectre (Desolate + attack damage) * Clinkz (Searing Arrows + attack damage) * Spirit Breaker (Greater Bash + Nether Strike or attack damage) * Lich (Frost Blast 2 damage instances on primary target) * Enchantress (Impetus + attack damage) * Silencer (Glaives of Wisdom + attack damage) * Elder Titan (Echo Stomp 2 damage instances)  But these one work as expected. The first instance procs Borrowed Time and the second instance is turned into a heal.  ---  #6.Borrowed Time cannot be shift-queued.  Same fate shared with Morphling's Morph Ursa's scepter upgraded Enrage and Bane's Nightmare End sub-ability.  They all cannot be shift-queued. This is because of this flag they have:   DOTA_ABILITY_BEHAVIOR_IGNORE_PSEUDO_QUEUE  This is what allows them to be cast while disabled. However for some reason it breaks shift-queue for those abilities. It shouldn't do that.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bVYpszEadw)  ---  #7.Mist Coil causes the target enemy to suicide if they have Lotus Orb buff on  This is a bullshit interaction which really shouldn't happen.  You want to finish an enemy off with Mist Coil the enemy is low enough to die to your coil. But the enemy has Echo Shell active from Lotus Orb. What happens instead is before your Mist Coil applies its damage Echo Shell reflects it applying the self-damage *denying the hero* and then your mist coil applies its damage after the target denied itself.  Why is lotus orb able to apply the spell effect before the original caster's spell applies its effect?  Mist Coil isn't the only spell suffering from this. Many single-target spells have this issue. If a spell is lethal to both of you you actually die first to the reflected spell instead of the target to your spell.  I suggest adding a split second delay to the reflecting of the spell. The spell should first be able to apply its effect before being reflected.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixPJbktpQeU)  ^^Edit: ^^I ^^might ^^be ^^a ^^bit ^^biased ^^on ^^this ^^one.  ---  #8. Curse of Avernus doesn't grant Abaddon the buff on his first attack vs buildings.  His passive is supposed to buff Abaddon against any non-ward non-allied target no matter whether the enemy is debuffed already or not. This works fine against heroes and units but not against buildings.  The ability can place its debuff on buildings. So Abaddon should get the buff on the first attack against them.

This interaction is broken since the aoe targeting cursor was added to Unstable Concoction.  **Repro:**  * Get Lotus Orb and Linken's Sphere * Stand next to an ally who also has Linken's Sphere and cast Lotus Orb on self * Have an enemy Alchemist target the ally with Unstable Concoction  **Result:** The concoction is blocked and reflected by your sphere/orb as a secondary target. The ally's Linken's Sphere does not prevent the aoe effect from happening.  **Expected behavior:**Reflected only when primary target. Blocked compeltely including aoe effect only when primary target. Should behave like how Storm Hammer behaves.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei15jm4zRkI)  ----  #2. Unstable Concoction's projectile provides no vision.  Even in 7.00 its vision was acknowledged. It was reduce from 400 to 300. But currently its vision does not work at all.  **Repro:**  * Throw Unstable Concoction at an enemy * Have the enemy move inside the fog of war (e.g. blink away)  **Result:** The projectile does not provide any vision as it travels through the fog. It just dsappears. It also doesn't apply lingering vision on impact.  **Expected behavior:** The projectile should provide 300 radius vision around itself and around the target upon impact for 3 seconds.  [From the 7.00 changelog] (http://i.imgur.com/4ZdavV3.png)  [Demo of current behavior] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPnalZR1qp8) no vision is provided at any time.  PS: The vision is broken since the aoe targeting cursor was added to Unstable Concoction.  ---  #3. Unstable Concoction can shuffle Rubick's ability positions  This is only an issue when Rubick has Aghanim's Scepter since only then the cooldown realistically allows you to repro it. Or some weird combo with octarine core arcane rune and chakra magic or a refresher.  **Repro:**  * Steal Unstable Concoction * Start brewing * While brewing steal another spell * While still brewing re-steal Unstable Concoction  **Result:** The concoction doesn't fully cancel upon losing the spell. It blows up on Rubick but it's still brewing and even displays the timer above Rubick still. When you don't re-steal it the timer just runs out and nothing happens. But when you re-steal it before that it blows up a second time upon reaching 0 and then shuffles your ability positions.  **Expected behavior:** As soon as Rubick loses the concoction spell it should *fully* cancel. The timer should disappear it should stop brewing. So there is no chance for this shuffling to happen when re-stealing it.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzPKWkE7R7Y)  --- #4. Aghanim's Scepter Synth buff doesn't grant its stats to illusions  **Repro:**  * Pick Alchemist and get Manta Style * Buy Aghanim's Scepter and infuse it into yourself * Create illus and check their stats/hp/mana  **Current behavior:** Your illus have less stats/hp/mana than you but they do copy the synth buff. If you just manta with the aghs in the inventory they obviously copy the item and all its stats normally.  **Expected behavior:** Illus should gain the stats/hp/mana from the Aghanim's Scepter Synth buff like how they do when copying Aghanim's Scepter as an item.  [video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHUOAc5RIeY)  ---  #5.Unstable Concoction doesn't apply aoe effect when blowing up on self while invulnerable/hidden  This is an inconistancy with the spell. When your targeted enemy hero turns invulnerable or hidden it does apply the aoe effect still. But if it blows up on yourself while invulnerable or hidden no aoe effect is applied.  **Repro:**  * Start brewing Unstable Concoction * Position yourself close to an enemy hero * Before it blows up turn invulnerable (e.g. Eul's) * Compare the behavior when throwing it and the target turns invulnerable before impact  **Result:** The aoe effect is not applied when blowing up on self. Aoe effect is applied when impacting the target.  **Expected behavior:** It should always apply its aoe effect no matter whether thrown or not. It should hit enemies around alch even when Alch is invulnerable.  PS: This interaction is also broken since the aoe targeting cursor was added to it.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YHUOGNbx_w)  ---  #6. Reflecting Unstable Concoction while brewing one cancels the brewing  A scenario which is currently only possible vs Rubick.  **Repro:**  * Get a Lotus Orb * Have an enemy Rubick steal Unstable Concoction * Start brewing your concoction and put Lotus Orb buff on self * Get hit by the enemy Rubick's Concoction  **Result:** Your brewing cancels as soon as you are hit by it. The reflected concoction stuns and damages based on how long you brewed.  **Expected:** Your brewing should continue normally. The reflected concoction's damage/stun should be based on how long Rubick brewed his concoction.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZLZA09Wl5I)  ---  #7. Recasting Unstable Concoction resets the damage/stun of the projectile of the previous cast  A scenario possible with Refresher or with Octarine Core/Arcane Rune and Chakra Magic.  **Repro:**  * Cast Unstable concoction and brew it for full duration * Throw the max brewed concoction at an enemy * While the projectile flies start brewing a new concoction  **Result:** The projectile although fully brewed damages and stuns based on your second cast's brew time so it basically deals very little damage and mini-stuns.  **Expected behavior:** The casts should be all independent. A new cast should not reset the previous cast.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Apquo7mCo)  ---  #8. Greevil's Greed does not proc against the Tempest Double  **Repro:**  * Level up Greevil's Greed * Kill a Tempest Double  **Result:** No extra gold is granted no stack is added to Greevil's Greed.  **Expected:** Extra gold should be granted and a stack should be added.  The ability tooltip states that it works against any unit that grants gold. The double does grant bold since I don't remember which patch added it. So it should work with Greed now.  PS: Illus have a bounty now too. Should it work against those as well?  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BX2KQkJVGM)  ---  #9. Unstable Concoction can't target but can hit creep-heroes  Some strange inconsistancy. It can only target heroes. But its aoe effect can hit heroes and creep-heroes.  It should either:  * Be able to target creep-heroes as well or * Do not creep-heroes within its area.  Or a buff: Make it hit all creeps within its area.

Hope you guys enjoy reading it and upvote it so Valve might see it.   ___ **The following buffs and debuffs must be added or theyre already there but with title DOTA_TOOLTIP_MODIFIER and no description at all:**  * Ancient Apparition  Chilling Touch attacks debuff * Axe  Aghanim Scepter  Battle Hunger debuff (Reducing damage output by 30%)   * Beastmaster  Primar Roar Buff * Chaos Knight  Reality Rift debuff * Clockwerk  Talents  Rocket Flare Truesight (Can be seen by enemies when invisible) * Crystal Maiden  Talents  +14% Manacost and Manaloss Reduction Aura * Death Prophet  Spirit Siphon buff (Healing) * Death Prophet  Talents  Exorcism Grants Haste buff  * Drow Ranger  Gust debuff (Knockbacked!) * Elder Titan  Aghanim Scepter  Earth Splitter debuff (Disarmed) * Ember Spirit  Sleight of Fist buff * Faceless Void  Time Dilation debuff * Faceless Void  Chronosphere buff (Haste) * Faceless Void  Talents  25% Backtrack buff * Gyrocopter  Aghanim Scepter  Side Gunner buff * Huskar  Berserker's Blood buff * Invoker  Cold Snap stun debuff * Io  Relocate buff (On Allies) * Io  Talents  Tether Grants Scepter Bonus buff (On Allies) * Legion Commander  Aghanim Scepter  Duel buff (Spell Immunity and 0 Incoming damage) * Lone Druid  Talents  Battle Cry Grants Spell Immunity buff * Magnus  Skewer buff (When gore enemies) * Morphling  Adaptive Strike (Strength) debuff * Morphling  Talents  2 Waveform Charges buff * Necrophos  Reapers Scythe debuff * Night Stalker  Hunter in the Night buff (When activated at night) * Outworld Devourer  Astral Imprisonment debuff * Pugna  Life Drain buff (On Allies) * Queen of Pain  Talents  Scream of Pain 1.5s Fear debuff * Riki  Aghanim Scepter  Tricks of the Trade buff (On Allies) * Rubick  Talents  +75% Spell Amp for Stolen Spells buff * Sand King  Talents  50% Sand Storm Slow and Blind debuff * Slardar  Guardian Sprint debuff (Taking 15%  more damage is a debuff not buff; Split them.) * Slardar  Guardian Sprint (When in river) * Spectre  Desolate debuff * Templar Assassin  Talents  Psi Blades Spill Paralyzes debuff * Timbersaw  Timber Chain buff * Timbersaw  Aghanim Scepter  Chakram debuff (Targets only get one debuff under both Chakrams activated) * Treant Protector  Natures Guise buff (When invisible) * Treant Protector  Natures Guise debuff  * Treant Protector  Leech Seed buff (Treant Protector and nearby friendly units) * Underlord  Dark Rift buff (When teleporting) * Viper  Nethertoxin debuff * Visage  Familiar  Gravekeeper's Cloak buff * Warlock  Talents  Magic Immunity for Golems buff (On Golems) * Witch Doctor  Aghanim Scepter  Death Ward buff (True Strike) * Wraith King  Vampiring Aura buff (On Wraith King himself) * Zeus  Lightning Bolt and Thundergods Wrath debuffs (True Sight)  ___ **The following debuffs only have a title which says Stunned or Silenced with no description at all they should probably have a title which is the name of the ability and a proper description (Ref.

Can't click on minimap,self.DotA2,Last update pretty much broke the minimap for me   Can't click on it most of the time almost lost a game because of that,bug
Some 7.00 stuff with bothers me + some bugs,self.DotA2,"Few things I gathered over the last few days. Some of them are bugs and some are things which bother me.  ---  # ~~Neutrals' gold/xp bounty increases by 3% per cycle instead of 2%~~  ~~The changelog stated a 2% increase per 7.5 minutes. But currently they increase by 3%.~~  ~~Easiest way to test this is with Roshan (yes he is affected by this)~~  * ~~Killing Roshan on minute 7 grants 890 xp (750 +20*7)~~ * ~~If it would increase by 2% killing him after 7:30 but before 8:00 should grant 907 xp (890*1.02)~~ * ~~But instead it grants 916 xp (890*1.03)~~  ~~[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE_99IQIPD4)~~  ###**Fixed**  ---  # ~~Life Drain's vision is granted to both teams when cast on Roshan/neutrals~~  ~~Obviously shouldn't be the case. As of now you cannot use Life Drain on Roshan (which is basically Pugna's only way to contribute to fighting Roshan) because it will reveal Roshan to the enemy team.~~  ~~Now due to another old bug which prevents Pugnas and Lions from using Life/Mana Drain when they were created with -createhero I cannot demonstrate this with enemy Pugna perspective.~~  ~~[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-gVY7YONJM)~~  ###**Fixed**  ---  # Eye of the Storm doesn't prioritise lower hp target if multiple enemies are Static Linked  Minor thing which matters for Refresher Razors which isn't too uncommon since all his spells synergise well with it.  Since 7.06 his storm strikes the linked target if it is within strike range. So what happens if you have multiple enemies Static Linked?  **Current behavior:** When multiple enemies are Static Linked the storm strikes them randomly  **Expected behavior:** When multiple enemies are Static Linked the storm prioritises the one with the lowest hp  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo5Rhcz7DZk)  ---  #Hunter in the Night doesn't grant flying vision when cast by other heroes than Night Stalker  The vision is currently only working for Night Stalker. When the spell gets cast by any other hero they do not gain flying vision.  This is only  an issue for Rubick in regular dota and for every hero in Ability Draft  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cohCOblhsskli)  --- #Rubick's Pulse Nova/Culling Blade do not apply Lightning Storm/Battle Hunger when upgraded  This is a big let-down.  When there is forced synergy like this going on Rubick usually copies this. This is how it works(/worked) for other scepter upgrades which make use of multiple spells. For example his Sanity's Eclipse and Global Silence did apply Astral Imprisonment and Arcane Curse. His Freezing Field does apply Frostbite. Even from this patch his Mystic Snake does apply the Stone Gaze debuff on enemies.  But the new Pulse Nova doesn't randomly strike enemies with lightnings and Culling Blade doesn't apply Battle Hunger on enemies.  ---  #Supernova Rearm -wtf and -refresh do not replenish charges  Currently only Refresher Orb is able to replenish charges of spells. And the dev command version of -refresh (the chat-entered -refresh does not)  However all of these are able to refresh the cooldown on the charge-based abiliyt and if you attempt to cast it it gives you ""CUSTOM ERROR"" as error message.  So there are 2 issues:  1. Them being able to refresh that cooldown is completely pointless if no charges are replenished 2. The fact that the custom error message has been removed (it used to say ""No charges"" but not says ""CUSTOM ERROR"") indicates that Refresher change was supposed to be a general change and not specific to Refresher only.  So the most logical thing here would be to make Supernova Rearm and the -refresh and -wtf commands replenish charges as well  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix4I_nkNphA)  ---  # Soul Catcher (and Shadow Poison) don't affect *all* units under Disruption  Not a new bug but it is more relevant now with the Soul Catcher change.  Shadow Demon has this synergy going on between Disruption and his spells that being all of his spells are able to affected units under Disruption.  However they can only affect the *last* unit SD Disrupted so if you have multiple enemies disrupted only the last one will get hit.  **Current behavior:** Shadow Poison and Soul Catcher only debuff (or add stacks) on the last disrupted enemy  **Expected behavior:** Shadow Poison and Soul Catcher debuff (or add a stack) to *all* disrupted enemies. It also should not matter whether the disruption was cast by an enemy or by an ally (e.g. enemy Rubick).  **Note:** The damage of Demonic Purge and release damage of Shadow Poison work fine. They always hit disrupted units.  [Video demo]  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6KNzBC8qto)  ---  # Spell charges granted by Aghs or Talents do not have infinite charges in wtf mode  This isn't a new bug but I mention this because we now have another hero who suffers from this issue.  **Current behavior:** -wtf mode grants infinite charges to:   * Spin Web * Spirit Siphon * Stone Remnant * Fire Remnant * Shrapnel  **But it does *not* grant infinite charges to:**  * Cold Feet (talent-granted charges) * Rupture (scepter-granted charges) * Homing Missile (talent-granted charges) * Astral Imprisonment (scepter-granted charges) * Demonic Purge (scepter-granted charges)  **Expected behavior:** -wtf mode should grant infinite charges to all charge-based spells and not to only those which are charge-based by default.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fy2z_2PPKM)  ---  #Enchanted Mangoes can't be sold within 10 seconds after purchase  Mangoes do not have the 10 seconds refund time anymore. I know they were turned unsellable but they should at least have the 10 refund phase where you can sell items back for their full price.  As of now an accidentally bought mango cannot be refunded. Especially in the early game this could be annoying. When you re-decide on your starting items (which seems to be kind of a common thing in any bracket based on what I observed and experienced) you can't undo the mango.  **Edit:** Looks like you can sell them but only pre-horn. Afer the first creep wave spawns it can't be sold at all anymore. Which is still kind of nonsense. It should always have the 10 seconds refund time.  ---  # Shockwave always uses the default sound upon traveling back when upgraded.  As of now this only affects Magnus' immortal item which has a custom sound effect.  It should use the custom sound upon cast and upon returning.

Reminder that Jakiro's Liquid Fire will hit both Dire's T4 towers but only one Radiant T4 tower.,self.DotA2,Basically the Dire towers are slightly closer together causing both to be hit.

Ever failed your typical avatoss combo as Tiny? Ever felt like sometimes your hero just ignores your spellcast orders? This bug here may the reason why.,self.DotA2,"##**Required basics to understand the issue**  First let me show you how your unit reacts to receiving multiple orders very quickly:  [Video 1 demo of the auto-queue] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLmzSog83H8)  In this video you can see how Tiny executes multiple given orders. **I did not use shift-queue**. If I would have done that the [key screencast would have shown capsed latters and you would have seen the small shift-queue flags on the ground] (http://i.imgur.com/djIrC1h.png). You can see how the game auto-queues a maximum of 2 orders. If you give a 3rd order the first order is forgotten and the unit executes the last 2 (considering it didn't start executing the 1st order). That's why I couldn't do blink->veil->avalanche. In that order Tiny only did veil->avalanche.  ---- ##**The issue**  Ok and now to the bug which involves auto-attacking (in other words attacks which the unit does on itself without giving it the direct order to do so). This is what happens when you order your hero to quickly cast multiple spells while auto-attacking:  [Video 2 the bug which breaks the auto-queue] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szmWxG9b174)  As you can see when auto-attacking Tiny only executed the last ordered spell ignoring the first one. So avatoss is basically impossible if you click too fast. If you have auto-attack on you must wait for one spell to get cast first before ordering the 2nd one. I.e. Tiny must first start casting avalanche before you give the toss order otherwise the toss order will cancel out the avalanche order.  You can also see in the video that attack-ground has the same issue demonstrated with Puck. Because if you give an attack order on the ground your unit follows regular auto-attack rules. The auto-attack messes with jaunt->waning rift. If you press jaunt hotkey followed by rift hotkey jaunt will not get cast (note that jaunt like tiny's spells has a 0 second cast time).  And here is a comparison to forced attacks (i.e. directly targeting a unit with an attack (a+target unit or right-click unit)):  [Video 3 comparison to direct attack orders which don't break the auto-queue] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFIa2ATkjok)  When giving a direct attack order on a unit ordered spells still get auto-queued normally (up to 2 spells again like before)  ---- ##**Another auto-attack issue**  And here is another issue caused by auto-attacks which I feel like is related to the issue above:  [Video 4 another bug regarding auto-attacks and targeted attacks] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om75CpxJI98)  If your unit is auto-attacking another unit and then during its attack animation you give the unit a direct attack order *on the same target* your unit will *cancel* its current and completely restart its attack on the same target. This makes no sense at all attack orders on the current attack target should not cancel an ongoing attack on the target.  ---- ##**Conclusion:**  Auto-attack orders are treated differently than direct attack orders. That difference messes with the ""auto-queue"" effect and potentially messes with spell combos even with the most simple ones (avatoss jaunt->waning rift midnight pulse->blackhole tornado->emp slight of fist->searing chains etc etc).  ###**It would be nice if Valve would change this and make auto-attacks behave like directly targeted attacks.**   *Edit: If you want to repro this it is very simply. Just pick tiny and go to an enemy. Order an attack on the ground so that Tiny starts attacking it. While attacking cast avalanche and toss on the unit. Easiest way to do this is to use quickcast and simply press ava and toss hotkeys simultaniously. You should notice that most of the time Tiny will only cast one of the 2 spells.*  *And here is a match ID of a custom lobby using Luxembourg server. I think it should be viewable to the devs at least (I hope). 2345072840*",bug

Arc Warden is currently receiving half exp when his tempest double is out,self.DotA2,"**I want to emphasize that Zet's clone effectively removes exp from the game if it participates in fights it means that your entire team suffers as a result if it helps push your team suffers as a result. Any exp it receives disappears from the game after it vanishes.**  **It should either work like a Meepo clone or receive no exp whatsoever. The latter option is probably safer from a balance perspective.**   Exp comparisons: http://imgur.com/a/eO5iY    -| Just Zet| Zet /w Double ---|---|---- One creep wave | 227 exp | 113 exp One level 11 axe kill at lvl 6| 1000 exp| 610 exp   So if you've played Arc Warden in the last week you may have noticed that you were inexplicably falling behind in levels compared to your teammates and enemies. I chalked this up to me being bad with the hero and needing to ""get good"" or a consequence of playing safely with the double but actually there's a pretty huge bug that's causing Arc warden to get half the exp he would normally get when his clone is out. His clone receives half of the exp and is treated like a teammate so whenever he uses  his ult he receives half the normal amount of exp from creeps or kills.   This might be what set his winrate back to the stoneage because he already has shitty stat gains he's usually playing at a lower level than everyone else.   TLDR: Tempest Double behaves like a hero and recieves half the exp that Zet does leading to underleveled Zet  I don't see how this could be intended but if it is feel free to berate me.   Edit: Mandatory dev.dota2 thread http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=187175&p=1292803#post1292803  AND IT'S FIXED. Thank you mr lizard.   The tempest double now works similar to a necro unit it does not grant exp for its kills but it doesn't sap exp from nearby allies either. ",bug

Tiny 308dmg (318dmg with aghs) + 660 (2x rapier).   Damage multiplier of Tir2 = 1 - 0.06  armor  (1 + (0.06  |armor|)) = 0.431.   Tiny with aghs (75% bonus damage to buildings) => x1.75   While protected the building takes 25% less damage from any source => x0.75   And building got 50% dmg from ""Hero"" attack type => x0.5   http://i.imgur.com/sdW2Jag.png   Screenshot description: I hit Tir2 (under backdoor protection) twice w/ aghs twice w/o aghs. Moved creep closer so BP down and hit Tir2 twice w/ aghs twice w/o aghs.   1. Tiny's dmg w/o aghs to unprotected Tir2:   (308+660)\*0.431\*0.5=209   2.

PSA: MKB doesn't work on your main hero or illusions if you spawn illusions,self.DotA2,When your hero has an mkb you get 75% accuracy and every accuracy proc does 60 pure damage. However as soon as you spawn an illusion it stops giving you accuracy and damage and your illusions don't get accuracy. This is most notable on am since he likes to buy mkb and he spawns illusions every time he blinks (with the talent) or every time he uses manta. It doesn't seem to fix unless you die. This makes it not even worth to buy mkb on any hero as well because if you pick up an illusion rune it becomes worthless except for the attack speed. Pretty gamebreaking Mercedes plz fix.  Edit: It is fixed now praise volvo,bug
Hero2: Everything wrong with Ancient Apparition part 1/2,self.DotA2,"[part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5v8vk5/hero3_everything_wrong_with_ancient_apparition/):  E: Yes I failed the title.  Once a week or every 2 weeks I'll make a post focusing on a single hero pointing out every issue I could find (this includes cosmetic items) and also including some suggestions for the hero mainly quality of life stuff and minor possible improvements. -  Since no one is perfect I probably missed some stuff. If you know any other issue about this hero or have an idea for small improvement (not balancing stuff) feel free to post them -  Some of these posts will be split up into multiple ones because else they'll get too long. -  --- Hero 1: Abaddon [part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5s91yi/hero1_everything_wrong_with_abaddon_part_12_a_new/) [part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5sawt1/hero1_everything_wrong_with_abaddon_part_22/)  Hero 2: Alchemist [part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5tboxq/hero2_everything_wrong_with_alchemist_part_12/) [part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5tbqie/hero2_everything_wrong_with_alchemist_part_22/)  --- #Part 1 of 2: Bugs  ##[](/hero-ancientapparition) Ancient Apparition  * Total number of subjects: 22 * Number of bugs: 13 (this post) * Number of minor issues: 5 (next post) * Number of other stuff:  3 (next post)  ^^^other ^^^stuff ^^^includes ^^^inconsistencies ^^^inconveniences ^^^and ^^^suggestions  ^^^Bugs ^^^are ^^^sorted ^^^by ^^^order ^^^of ^^^severity.  ---  #1. Cold Feet (& Homing Missile) always use level 1 cooldown as recharge time regardless of level  Cold Feet has a cooldown of 13/11/9/7. So when chosing the charges talent on level 25 you'd expect the recharge time to be equal to the cooldowns right? Yea but that's not quite the case.  **Repro:**  1. Level up to 25 and chose the Cold Feet charges talent 2. Have Cold Feet on level 2 or higher (most noticable with level 4) 3. Immediately use all your charges 4. Check the recharge time (displayed like a cooldown when having 0 charges) 5. As soon as a charge is ready use it up immediately again 6. Check the recharge time again  **Result:** The *very first* charge recharging uses the current level's cooldown as recharge time. *All other* charges recharging right after it use the level 1 cooldown as recharge time. So for it to use the correct time you must have 3/3 charges otherwise it will use the lvl 1 recharge time.  **Expected behavior:** All charges should recharge using the current level's cooldown.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-75yZ9Islk)  --- #2. Cold Feet's break distance is spherical instead of a flat circle  Usually Dota 2 uses 2 dimensional areas for this kind of stuff. Cold Feet is one of the 2 spells which use a 3 dimensional shape for their range checks. (edit: The second spell being Timbersaw's Chakrams).  **Repro:**  1. Cast Cold Feet on an enemy 2. Have a Tiny toss the same unit straight upwards  **Result:** Cold Feet gets dispelled because Toss moves the unit outside of the spherical shaped search area  **Expected behavior:** Like every other aoe effect Cold Feet's search area should be a 2 dimensional circle.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X9-3Lq8Z6Q)  Edit: Note that Toss is just the best example. Any way of upward movement can cancel it when being far enough away from the center. a Cyclone cancels it when about 300 range off from the center.  --- #3. Rubick copies the charges-talent when stealing Cold Feet (& Homing Missile)  Rubick genereally does *not* copy and talent bonus spells receive. For some reason Cold Feet and Homing Missile talents are the only ones being copied.  **Repro:**  1. Steal Cold Feet (or Homing Missile) from an enemy AA (or Gyro) who has the lvl 25 charges talent skilled 2. Steal any other talent-boosted spell from another enemy  **Result:** Your stolen Cold Feet has the charges as well the talent gets copied. Other stolen talent-boosted spells are not talent-boosted for Rubick.  **Expected behavior:** The talent bonus should not be copied.  **Personal opinion:** Would be much better if Rubick would copy talent bonuses the enemy has chosen. Or at least as an aghs upgrade.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjTfVVHZpTs)  ---  #4. Ice Blast can shatter enemies who are above the shatter threshold  This is an issue caused by how Ice Blast checks for health and shatters. Currently it checks for your health on each tick. If on one tick your hp is below the shatter threshold you *will* shatter on the next tick. This means if you Time Lapse or Sunder within that tick you'll still shatter.  **Repro:**  1. Get hit by Ice Blast 2. Have your hp drop close to the shatter point 3. As soon as reaching the shatter point cast Time Lapse/Sunder so that your above the threshold again  **Result:** You shatter even if you managed to heal back up to full health.  **Expected behavior:** The health check and the shatter should happen on the same tick and not be delayed by a tick  **Personal opinion:** Make Ice Blast prevent *absolutely every* form of hp increase. As of now 4 sources are still able to ""heal"" through it 2 of them being obvious bugs (see below) and the other 2 being Sunder and Time Lapse.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLd1hZPEP1E) [Combat log] (http://i.imgur.com/YgnP4iS.png)  --- #5. Decay and Whirling Death can heal through Ice Blast's hp freeze  Ice Blast is supposed to freeze your hp. Every healing and hp regen is prevented. *Even hp gain from gaining strength is prevented like picking up str items toggling Armlet or morphing strength*. But for some reason Decay and Whirling Death (the hp again upon losing the debuff when being a str hero) are not prevented.  **Repro as Undying:**  1. Be at like 50% hp 2. Get hit by Ice Blast 3. Cast Decay on enemy heroes (with Aghs for more obvious results)  **Result:** The 50% hp part isnt necessary but makes this much clearer. Your current hp raises. The healing aspect of Decay (which is coded into the ability) goes through Ice Blast and heals you.  **Repro as Timbersaw**  1. Be a strength hero and at like 50% hp (again hp amount only to make it more obvious) 2. Get hit by Whirling Death 3. Before the debuff expires get hit by Ice Blast. Time it so that it expires while frostbitten  **Result:** Upon losing the Whirling Death debuff you get healed (same as with Decay this is coded into the ability). That healing ignores the Ice Blast debuff and heals through it.  **Expected behavior:** Just like how it is with other str granting effects Decay and Whirling Death should not be able to increase your current hp while frostbitten.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrLJRsdV9YE)  (PS: In the video you can also see how Whirling Death's heal per strength was not updated from 19 to 20. Omni lost 18.69 strength per WD debuff and upon expiring he regained 355 hp per debuff 18.69\*19=355.11)  ---  #6.Ice Blast prevents Reaper's Scythe from increasing respawn time  It also prevents Necrophos from getting the kill credits.  **Repro:**  1. Hit an enemy hero with Ice Blast 2. Before they shatter cast Reaper's Scythe on it so that they shatter during its stun  **Result:** The shatter kills the target creditting it to whoever caused the shatter. Its respawn time is not increased.  **Expected behavior:** Reaper's Scythe should probably take priority. It should force the credit to Necrophos. Either way it definitely should apply its respawn time increase no matter how the target dies during it.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hak6X5fG_gk)  ---  #7. Ice Blast prevents Duel from graning victory damage  Only happens when the *caster* of Duel dies to the shatter. Works fine when the duel *target* dies to Ice Blast instead.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Duel on an enemy 2. Get hit by Ice Blast 3. Die to Ice Blast's shatter during the duel  4. Repeat the test but this time with the duel target dying to Ice Blast shatter  **Result:** Your duel target who is victor does not gain the victory damage bonus. If the roles are reversed (duel target dies to ice blast shatter instead of duel caster) the victor does gain the victory damage  Note that the behavior is not bugged when not dying to the shatter (i.e. enemy straight-out kills you without the shatter proccing)  **Expected behavior:** The target should be able to gain the damage if the duel caster dies to Ice Blast.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce_qTM3mURo)  ---  #8. Ice Blast prevents Wraith King's Reincarnation when having Soul Ring buff  Happens when you need the Soul Ring's 150 mana for the Reincarnation.  **Repro:**  1. Be Wraith King at low mana 2. Use your Soul Ring so that you have enough mana with Reincarnation 3. Die to Ice Blast's shatter  **Result:** Despite having enough mana you do not reincarnate. You do reincarnate if the shatter was not the cause of the death (i.e. enemy just kill you straigh-out without the shatter proccing)  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5fFaGwm7l4)  ---  #9. Tempest Double's gold/xp bounties are not granted when it dies to Ice Blast shatter  **Repro:**  1. Hit an enemy Tempest Double with Ice Blast 2. Drop its health below the shatter threshold  **Result:** When it dies to the shatter its gold/xp bounties are not granted. Its bounties are granted when the shatter was not the cause of the death (i.e. you kill it straight-out without the shatter proccing).  **Expected behavior:** Gold and experience should be granted normally.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdlFjGcsr_4)  ---  #10. Ice Blast (and False Promise) instantly remove hp gained through Granite Aura.  When you are at full hp and are affected by the ancient golem's Granite Aura getting hit by Ice Blast instantly reduces your hp back to its regular value. Same goes for when getting targeted by False Promise.  **Repro:**  1. Be at full or almost full hp and stand within Granite Aura range 2. Get hit by Ice Blast or targeted by False Promise  **Result:** Your current hp instantly drops to what it would be if you were not affected by Granite Aura.  **Expected behavior:** Your current hp should freeze at where it is at and not where it would be without the aura. The aura bonus should not be removed by Ice Blast/False Promise  **Example:** Let's say your hero has 1000 health by default. When the Granite Aura affects you your health raises to 1150. When hit by Ice Blast/False Promise your hp instantly drops from 1150/1150 to 1000/1150.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89ILa0g9tbI)  ---  #11. Recasting Ice Blast makes the previous cast hit the new location  Your typical multi-instance bug. If you cast Ice Blast before the previous cast's projectile impacts it messes with the previous projectile.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Ice Blast and Release the icy ball 2. Before the Icy ball impacts re-cast Ice Blast at a new location  **Result:** The ice ball of the *first* cast explodes where you *targeted* the *second* Ice Blast (not where you stopped the 2nd cast's tracer it literally explodes where you clicked with your mouse). It explodes there upon reaching its own marked area.  **Expected behavior:** A new cast should not interfere with previous casts. The previous Ice Blast should exlode where its aoe indicator is.  Yes this is abusable but not worth the Refresher Orb.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNCSzVi2rnw)  ---  #12. AA illusions have lvl 1 Ice Blast when spawned while the sub-spell is active # ALT-clicking Ice Blast always says it's level 1 when done while the sub-spell is active  This happens because the sub-spell has only 1 level instead of having 3 levels like the main spell.  **Repro:**  1. Have Ice Blast on level 2 or 3 2. Cast Ice Blast but don't release the ice ball 3. While the tracer travels spawn illusions of Ancient Apparition 4. Also ALT-click Ice Blast meanwhile  **Result:** The illus have level 1 Ice Blast instead of 2/3. ALT-clicking it also says it's on level 1 instead of 2/3  **Expected behavior:** Illus should copy the correct level. ALT-clicking should also show the correct level. The sub-spell should have 3 levels like the main spell and its level should be set equal to Ice Blast's level.  Other spells with the same bug:  * Tether * Nightmare * Telekinesis * Song of the Siren  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPzeN12RyJY)  ---  #13. Ice Blast malfunctions when cast by an illusion and the illu dies during it  A very rare bug but still a bug nontheless. When an illusion casts Ice Blast and it dies during it (doesn't matter if while the tracer or the ice ball travels) the ice ball does nothing and the aoe indicator gets stuck  **Repro:**  1. Pick Rubick and get Aghanim's Scepter 2. Spell-steal Nether Swap 3. Die so that the Vengeance illusion spawns 4. Spell-steal Ice Blast with the Vengeance Rubick illusion 5. Cast Ice Blast 6. While either of its projectiles travel have the illusion die (no matter how)  **Result:** When dying while the tracer travels the tracer stops and marks the area and the ice ball gets released (expected behavior since this is what happens when AA or Rubick die during it). However the ice ball neither debuffs enemies it passes through nor applies the impact damage/debuff upon reaching its destination. Furthermore the giant dome marking the aoe gets permanently stuck.  **Expected behavior:** Same behavior as when AA or Rubick die during it: Ice ball can debuff enemies impact damage/debuffing applies giant aoe marking dome disappears once the ball explodes.

You can see smoke being used by clicking on their inventory in the fog of war,self.DotA2,I don't know if this is intentional but I clicked on a furion who had a smoke and he went in the fog of war. The smoke then disappeared from his inventory and they had indeed smoked into rosh.   edit: apparently this issue is not unique to just smokes. People have reported inventory changes in relation to bottling runes wards and other things. ,bug

List of issues compiled by the community,self.DotA2,"**UPDATE 4**  Added batch No.3. Will probably go to sleep now will try to add stuff tomorrow before I leave for work and the rest after work.

[Bug] Unintentional PA nerf,self.DotA2,Recently the PA dagger has been reworked to perform a physical attack on landing. Phantom strike gives you IAS for 4 attacks 'on the same target'.  So if you dagger on one target and phantom strike on another then the dagger hit cancels your IAS for the phantom strike because it now thinks you switched targets.  ~~In a certain situation this might even be gamebreaking.~~  Edit : wew my first front page post   ^_^ thanks r/dota2  Edit 2 : as pointed out by someone it is not gamebreaking but it may cause you to lose a game in a very specific situation.   ,bug

Hero2: Everything wrong with Alchemist part 2/2,self.DotA2,"[part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5tboxq/hero2_everything_wrong_with_alchemist_part_12/)  Here is part 2 covering other stuff like minor glitches inconsistencies inconveniences and some suggestions.  Note that most of these are not considered bugs. They are things that I think are hindering the hero unecessarily and would be nice if they were changed/tweaked. -  ---   #Part 2 of 2: Suggestions and other minor things.  ##[](/hero-alchemist) Alchemist  * Total number of subjects: 19 * Number of bugs: 9 (previous post) * Number of minor issues: 4 (this post) * Number of other stuff: 6 (this post)  ^^^other ^^^stuff ^^^includes ^^^inconsistencies ^^^inconveniences ^^^and ^^^suggestions  ---  #1. Heroes who cant sell aghs still cant sell it after getting Aghs Synth buff  There are several heroes who cannot sell their Scepters (earth spirit lifestealer treant meepo etc) due to the nature of the upgrade they get.  However once getting the Aghs Synth buff from Alchemist it would make sense to allow them to sell it since they still have the Synth buff after selling it.  They already can sell a second bought aghs or even their first aghs if bought after getting the synth buff. Only the first aghs from before getting the snyth buff cannot be sold.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_npJs14caf8)  ---  #2. Alchemist's illusions gain mana regen from Chemical Rage  This is an inconsistancy. No other source of mana regeneration works for illusions. Only Chemical Rage's regen works.  Health regeneration is consistant throughout not even Chemical Rage's hp regen bonus works for them.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzsS7mgGZQM)  My suggestion: Make all mana regen sources work for them. I don't see a reason why not really. It would be a small buff to Morphling aghs and Vengance aghs the only illus who can cast spells.  ---  #3. Make Unstable Concoction brew sound fade in/out when alche enters/leaves fog  Similar to how Stone Gaze Illusory Orb and Ghostship work Unstable Concoction's brew sound should fade in/out when Alchemist enters or leaves the fog of war.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Wt7-1uOJ0)  ---  #4. Alchemist's ogre is not animated in Unstable Concoction Throw's animation  He just freezes whenever the sub-spell is cast. Only Razzil sitting on the Ogre is animated. He also lacks a throw animation during Chemical Rage. Whenever the Throw is cast the ogre's swords slide back on his back.  [Vide demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13XQ8bPzxu8)  ---  #5. Midas Knuckle's custom Greevil's Greed effect does not work.  Nothing more to add really.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOwHBK7BWMU)  ---  #6. Unstable Concoction brew sound cancels upon projectile impact of a previous cast  Another case of spells interfering with each other. If you start brewing unstable concoction while the previous cast's projectile still flies the new cast's brew sound stops as soonas the projectile hits.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S47WsMZK-4)  ---  #7. Chemical Rage causes attack animations to not random  Normally a hero has multiple different animations for attacks and they are randomly chosen per attack. But during Chemical Rage the hero just repeats one animation until canceling and restarting an attack. This affects Rubick as well when he steals Chemical Rage.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_JxskqOtHk)  ---  #8. The +80 Unstable Concoction damage talent is not added to the tooltip damage value  This goes for every new ability-buffing talent in 7.02.  [image] (http://i.imgur.com/5sZcWU1.png)  Very easy fix.  This thing      ""LinkedSpecialBonus""            ""special_bonus_unique_...""  needs to be added to the affected values in this case the concoction damage.  ---  #9. Alchemist thanks himself when infusing Scepter on self  Who the hell thanks himself? Looks like Alchemist does.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Qig5uAsNyU)  ---  #10 Tooltip stuff  This time it's only adding and changing of notes mainly.  * Add note to Unstable Concoction that it still applies the aoe effect when blowing up on self * Reword existing concoction notes to not have ""will"" and ""you"" in them (to fit the general style) * Add note to Greevil's Greed saying that it doesn't work vs illus and buildings * Add note to Greevil's Greed explaining its stacking behavior * Add note to Greevil's Greed telling that it's unreliable gold * Reword Greevil's Greed buff to not include ""you"". * Fix Chemical Rage note to not say ""avoid stuns"" since that's incorrect * Separate the disjoint part from that note and say that it applies upon cast (current one makes it sound like it disjoints everything for 0.35 seconds) * Add note to Chemical Rage telling that illus copy the buff  [image] (http://i.imgur.com/Bf41JyN.png)",bug

Berserker's Call's (and Winter's Curse) taunts malfunction when affected by multiple taunts at the same time  This is a bug which can screw you over when you have Axe+WW Axe+Legion or WW+Legion (or even all 3) in one team.  If you are affected by two taunts your unit will attack the first taunt source and switch over to the second taunt source once the first one expires. However if you spam your unit an order during the first taunt it bugs out. Instead of switching to the second taunt source your unit instead executes the order given to it. After finishing that order it stands still doing nothing until the second taunt expires.  **Current behavior:** Orders given at the transition between two taunts overrides the attack order of the taunt.  **Expected:** Taunts should periodically order your unit to attack the taunting unit. If the unit is found to execute a different order the taunt should cancel it and force you to attack again.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofFVTjb8dt8)  **Also:** It would be nice if taunts would get a priority order. As of now Duel has priority over other taunts. But Axe's Call and WW's curse have the same priority. So instead of   * **Duel > Winter's Curse = Berserker's Call**  make it   * **Duel > Winter's Curse > Berserker's Call**  ---  #2. Berserker's Call malfunctions when Axe turns invisible during it  When Axe turns invisible during any time of Berserker's Call and the enemy has no True Sight over him the taunted enemies can moved around and order to cast spells. However like in the previous bug only *one* order gets executed. After that order the unit stands still until the taunt expires.  **Current behavior:** Taunted units can execute one order when axe turns invis during Berserker's Call  **Expected behavior:** Multiple possibilities:  * Make it work like how it does when Axe enters the fog of war: The taunted units follow him and attack him again once turning visible * Taunted units stand still for the remaining duration or until Axe is visible again resuming attack * The taunt ends immediately once Axe turns fully invisible and when not revealed.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXDmpYT1-pw)  ---  #3. Counter Helix does not use a regular cooldown so it can't be reduced/increased  Counter Helix's cooldown seems to be hardcoded into the ability as some sort of custom cooldown system. This causes two issues:  1. The cooldown cannot be changed. It can neither be increased (Time Dilation) or reduced (Ocarine Core Arcane Rune Chakra Magic) 2. The icon of the ability does not show the cooldown upon proccing  As a comparison Legion Commander's Moment of Courage another passive ability with a very short cooldown uses a regular cooldown. You can see it going on cooldown on the icon when proccing and more importantly it is reduced by Octarine Core/Arcane Rune (and affected by Time Dilation and Chakra Magic)  **Current:** Counter Helix uses some weird custom cooldown system.  **Expected:** Counter Helix should use the regular default cooldown system.  In the video you can see how I set the ""cooldown"" to 10 seconds. But the ability uses this cooldown only to display the cooldown value in the description. As of now this value has no other purpose.  [Video demo] (http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=193346)  ---  #4. Culling Blade's kill threshold is off by 1 on each level  The kill threshold is supposed to be 250/325/400 (300/425/550 with Scepter).  Instead it is 249/324/399 (299/424/549 with scepter) off by 1 on each level with and without scepter.  Looks like ""<"" was used in the codes here. It should be """".  [Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igRQP_hW4O0)  ---  #5. Culling Blade can be cast on Wraith ghosts (WK's aghs effect) without killing them  Culling Blade cannot kill a hero who is in Wraith form (Wraith King's Aghanim's Scepter effect green ghosts). But it can be cast on them. When done it applies the effects as if the target was killed (aoe boost & cooldown reset).  **Current behavior:** Culling Blade can target but not kill wraiths applying aoe speed resetting cooldown  **Expected behavior:** two options:  * Culling Blade cannot target wraiths * Culling Blade kills wraiths when targeted (would be consistent other death-preventing effects like grave false promise and borrowed time)  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_ogyCPlgY8)  ---  #6. Rubick loses the move speed bonus from Battle Hunger upon losing the spell  Battle Hunger is supposed to grant you movement speed for each enemy you have cursed. But Rubick loses the speed upon losing the spell despite there still being cursed enemies.  **Current behavior:** Battle Hunger's speed bonus disappears on spell loss ignoring the fact that there still are cursed enemies.  **Expected behavior:** The speed bonus lasts until no cursed enemies are left.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT6pIzKbZ54)  ---  ##Tooltip stuff  His tooltip have several small issues and are heavily lacking in the ALT notes.  **Berserker's Call:**  * Has an unnecessary note about spell immunity (info is already in the box header) * Could make use of some new notes: * ALT note: Taunted units follow Axe if they can't attack or when Axe can't be attacked. * ALT note: Taunt is not canceled upon losing vision over Axe. * Alt note: Cannot taunt wards and buildings. * ALT note: Taunt immediately ends when Axe dies. * ALT note: Axe gains the armor even if the taunt fully misses.  **Battle Hunger:**  * Description doesn't clarify that Axe gains ms for units *he* cursed (i.e. Rubick's curses don't buff Axe) * First ALT note only mentions buildings (destroying buildings also removes curse). Should also mention wards and denying allies. * Second ALT note is redundant and slightly misleading. It says cursed units cant be denied. But you still can deny cursed non-heroes. And heroes are generally not denyable (only 3 debuffs in the game allow denying). * ALT note: Killing illus does not remove the curse * ALT note: Multiple curses don't stack on a target (should be mentioned since it lasts longer than its cooldown) * ALT note: Kills done with wards don't remove the curse for their owner (common misconception that it does should be clarified) * The self-buff doesn't tell how much ms you currently gain. * The curse debuff does not say that it slows you it only mentions the damage.  **Counter Helix:**  * Unecessary mention of damag type in the description (info is already in the box header) * First ALT note is kind of expected to work like that. Reword it to tell interaction with missed attacks instead. Or remove completely. * ALT note: Counter Helix works while hexed (common misconception that it doesn't mainly due to lack of visual feedback) * ALT note: Does not proc on attacks of wards and buildings (although I think it would be better to make it proc on building/ward attacks instead)  **Culling Blade:**  * Slightly wrong information in description. It currently says that the speed bonus and cooldown reset are only applied upon killing heroes. However only the cooldown reset applies when killing heroes. The speed bonus also applies when culling non-hero units* * ALT note: Does not go on cooldown upon killing heroes and illusions (to have illus mentioned as well) * ALT note: Aoe speed is always applied not only when culling heroes (extra clarification) * ALT note: Can kill heroes who are affected by spells which usually prevent death (Shallow Grave False Promise and Borrowed Time are meant) * The speed buff does not say how much speed it grants  [image comparing current to suggested] (http://i.imgur.com/EEAudZ4.jpg)  [link to the dota_english.txt changes] (http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=278398)d",bug

BUG: Viper Huskar Silencer and Clinkz have lower range when orb attacking than normally.,self.DotA2,**I reported this more than 5 months ago posted it in the dota 2 dev forum and Valve didn't do anything about it. Maybe it will make it to the first page this time so that Valve devs see it and do something about it.**  All these heroes have bugs related to their relative talent trees. The bugs occur when they pick dragon lance and skill their range increasing talents. Right clicking gives them the correct attack range but if you want to orb attack (orb auto cast is off) then the attack range is lower.

You can consistently escape Pounce and Kinetic Field prematurely by abusing terrain + a spell/spamming right-clicks,self.DotA2,tl;dr here's the video https://youtu.be/jlsOAaahNx0  You might have seen my comment in another thread where I was testing for this bug but I'm making it a separate post because with the help of /u/mrShoes1 I've figured out how to make it work 100% of the time. It's gone beyond the point of testing and is now just a confirmed bug. Here's a new YouTube video where I try to explain it as well as I can:   https://youtu.be/jlsOAaahNx0  Really late edit because I forgot: bu3ny on dev.dota figured out that anything blocking the straight path will cause this bug including units: https://youtu.be/hjoQwNsEOiM  **Non-Youtube explanation:** Corners and walls are bugged in their interaction with Slark's Pounce and Disruptor's Kinetic Field. By standing near a wall (~100 units?) while affected by one of these two abilities you can prematurely break their effects in two ways:  1. Cast a single-target spell on anyone beyond its max range instantly breaking you free to cast your spell (replicable 100% of the time with any single-target spell at any range beyond maximum). 2. Spam right clicks on somebody outside of your max range while reasonably close to a wall. Also 100% consistent though with a bit of delay.  This is actually brutal for the play of both heroes because it's actually so consistent and incredibly easy to perform. The degree of difficulty is akin to being a Spirit Breaker and finding a unit to charge away to! While I welcome the neutering of the annoying fish it's actually easier to ruin the dinosaur king's life and my friend actually really likes playing him so I hope it gets fixed before he feeds with Disruptor ^again ^^as ^^^usual  dev.dota thread: http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=158718&p=1219905#post1219905,bug

An old game-breaking disruptor bug is actually quite impactful now due to his new talents and some newer items.,self.DotA2,"So basically as far back as I can remember Disruptor's Kinetic Field (E) has had a major known bug where casting a second one while a first was active would cause the first wall to do nothing meaning enemies who you trapped inside can walk through the first wall freely even though it should still be active. You can reproduce this extremely easily in demo mode by enabling free spells trapping an enemy in a wall then casting another wall somewhere else which allows them to walk through the first wall.  Previously this wasn't a huge deal because it only mattered if you had a refresher orb which was almost never bought on disruptor. Now however with the -3s kinetic field cooldown lvl 15 talent and the +4s duration lvl 25 talent this bug actually matters in games that go late if you choose those talents as the duration is longer than the cooldown with those talents and it can be a huge deal for people who don't know about it. It also comes into play earlier due to arcane rune and also if you have a kotl on your team who reduces your cooldown via his E or if you buy an octarine/refresher or if you pick up the refresher shard from the third rosh kill.  Essentially though this bug has existed for a long time the circumstances where it might be relevant have increased dramatically from a single edge case where you had bought a refresher to now where in addition to the refresher it also shows up when you either hit level 25 kill rosh 3 times pick up an arcane rune after level 15 have a kotl on your team or buy octarine. Many of these circumstances are not exceptionally rare.  I'd like to get some attention for this bug to be fixed so that my ""Make Dota Great Again"" wall-building meme strat can be functional in turbo mode and also so that people don't unwittingly screw themselves by making certain talent or item choices without knowing the full implications.",bug

Kunkka's Tidebringer and Abyssal Blade Active using 128 cast range instead of 150,self.DotA2,I went ahead and tested everything that uses melee range as an ability or item that I could think of and found that only Kunkka's Tidebringer and Abyssal Blade's Overwhelm are still using 128 cast range.  Spells/Heroes that I tested  - Dragon Knight Dragon Tail (Non ult version 150) - Centaur Double Edge (150) - Doom Infernal Blade (Autocast and manual are 150) - Kunkka Tidebringer (Autocast is 150 manual is 128) - Tusk Walrus Punch (Autocast and manual are 150) - Abyssal Blade Overwhelm (140 cast) [My fault on initial test still lower than melee range]  I think that these 2 specific casts are just oversights from the 6.87 update.

List of Dark Willow bugs,self.DotA2,"These are all the bugs I found in the last 2 days on Dark Willow.  If you know about more post them here.  ##**Dark Willow**  ---- ---- ##General --- #1. Dark Willow still uses Puck's placeholder loadout particles upon spawning  Nothing more to add. She uses Puck's Illusory Orb burst particle effects in the loadout. She should use something of her own set of particles.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXxzWEru4YU)  --- --- ##Bramble Maze --- #1. Leveling up Bramble maze during an active instance updates the damage but not root duration  Inconsistent behavior when leveling the spell while there are brambles on the field already  **Repro:**  1. Cast Bramble Maze 2. Level up Bramble Maze 3. Have enemy walk into a bramble  **Result:** The bramble deals damage based on the *current* level but roots for a duration based on the level *upon cast*  **Expected:** Either both should use current level or both should use level upon cast.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCin9Fr35D4)  ---  #2. Heavy visual glitch with the immortal's Bramble Maze effect  If you cast Bramble Maze 7-8 times with the immortal equipped it completely breaks and your entire screen basically turns red.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9dL9QML__A)  --- --- ## Shadow Realm --- #1. Shadow Realm's damage doesn't apply when dispelled/dying before projectile hit  When Dark Willow gets dispelled or dies *after* launching the projectile but *before* it hits it will not apply the magical damage.  This is because the hidden modifier responsible for the damage is fully dispellable. It should not be.  Imagine if dispels or dying would stop e.g. TA's Meld attack from applying its damage/armor reduction. It makes no sense and shouldn't happen.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Shadow Realm 2. Launch an attack out of Shadow Realm 3. Before the projectile hits get dispelled or die  **Result:** The projectile deals no damage on impact.  **Expected:** Dispels and death should not nullify the damage.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6bxFGf0l4U)  ---  #2. Recasting and attacking with Shadow Realm a second time deals no damage  When you recast Shadow Realm and launch an attack while an attack of a previous cast is still flying the new cast's projectile will deal no damage to its target.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Shadow Realm and attack out of it 2. Before the projectile hits do the same again  **Result:** The second projectile deals no damage to its target. The first one deals its damage (correctly based on how long it was charged).  **Expected:** Each projectile should deal damage based on how long they were charged. Previous cast should not matter to them.  **Reason of result:** Currently Shadow Realm uses one modifier for each launched attack. And that one modifier is removed when the first launched attack hits its target. This means the attacks after it have no modifier for reference and therefore deal no damage.  **Solution:** Make each attack out of Shadow Realm place its own shadow_realm_buff_attack_logic modifier on Dark Willow instead of each attack refreshing the already existing one.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en3zSnoSSxQ)  ---  #3. Shadow Realm deals no damage if the target moved too far before impact  Shadow Realm's damage is not applied if the attack target moved too far before projectile impact. This means some heroes can just outrun it (e.g. Bloodseeker or a non-disjointing mobility spell) to avoid the huge burst damage.  In this example I used Meepo (Poof doesn't disjoint)  **Repro:**  1. Have a Meepo clone somewhere on the map 2. Have an enemy Dark Willow launch a Shadow Realm attack at you 3. Before the projectile hits you Poof to your Meepo clone 4. wait for the projectile to impact  **Result:** The projectile deals no bonus magical damage. Only the regular attack damage is applied.  **Expected:** Distance shouldn't matter it should always deal its damage on impact.  Reason for the result: The modifier responsible for the damage (placed on Dark Willow on attack launch) has a max duration of (I assume) 3 seconds. So it can expire before the attack lands so that the bonus damage is not applied.  **Solution:** Remove the max duration.  If this is intended then make the projectile turn into a regular attack projectile upon the modifier expiring or make the projectile disappear altogether. Currently it's nothing but confusing.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtiZ8DCj4Kc)  ---  #4. Allies can't target Dark Willow during Shadow Realm but can via portrait   An allied Dark Willow's model cannot be selected while she is under the effect of Shadow Realm so you cannot cast spells on her directly.  However there are multiple was to still target here:  1. Shift-queue your spell before she casts Shadow Realm 2. Give the cast order while outside of cast range before she gives Shadow Realm 3. Start the cast before she enters Shadow Realm 4. Target her hero portrait at the top in the HUD  I think her model should be selectable for allies. Only enemies should be unable to select her.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oADHuq9UHdc)  ---  #5. Shadow Realm's dmg buff doesn't disappear if it can't hit the target  The modifier responsible for the damage (dark_willow_shadow_realm_buff_attack_logic) does not disappear if the target:  1. Is Ethereal on impact 2. Is Invulnerable on impact 3. Is Hidden on impact 4. Disjoints the projectile 5. Evades the projectile with Evasion  The modifier should disappear when the projectile does. It should not soley rely on the projectile to actually connect with the target.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExnNDWdCMpc)  ---  #6. Shadow Realm's projectile is invisible and silent when attacking runes with it  When you attack a Rune out of Shadow Walk the attack projectile is invisible and there is no projectile impact sound. From the enemy perspective the rune may just disappear (if they don't know you are there and attacked it using the high attack range).  Also the damage buff (shadow_realm_buff_attack_logic modifier) does not disappear either if the target was a rune.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N88sw81pjPg)  ---  #7. Several projectile spells can still target Dark Willow during Shadow Realm   Shadow Realm protects against most projectile spells or ""hit single random enemy"" spells. This includes  1. Flaming Lasso (aghs secondary lasso) Viscous Nasal Goo (aghs upgraded) Searing Arrows (talent multishot) Battery Assault Bedlam Poison Touch Exorcism Marksmanship (aghs splinter arrows) Searing Chains Sleight of Fist Rocket Barrage Flak Cannon Pulse Nova (aghs single-target lightnings) Eclipse Split Shot Starstorm Adaptive Strike (multishot talent) Ignite (multicast) Stifling Dagger (multishot talent) Unstable Current Eye of the Storm Ether Shock Mass Serpent Wards (aghs split shot) Arcane Bolt (multishot talent & aghs multishot) Concussive Shot (aghs multishot) Ancient Seal (aghs multishot) Mystic Flare (aghs multishot) Assassinate (aghs aoe targeting) Charge of Darkness (target switching) Electric Vortex (aghs) Reflection Soul Rip Soul Assumption (multishot talent)   But these projectile spells can target her normally still  1. Spark Wraith 2. Mana Drain (multidrain talent) 3. Shadow Strike (650 aeo strike projectiles) 4. Concussive Shot 5. Heat-Seeking Missile 6. The Swarm 7. Shackleshot 8. Splinter Blast 9. Reincarnation Wraithfire Blasts  Considering that 80% of such spells can't target her then these 9 shouldn't either.  ---  #8. Shadow Realm doesn't cancel enemy single-target spells when already in their cast animations  Upon casting Shadow Realm any attack an enemy had begun gets canceled and she cannot be attacked during Shadow Realm  However if an enemy already began casting a single target spell that spell does not get canceled upon casting Shadow Realm. Spells cannot be targeted on her during Shadow Realm but spells which are already in the cast animation ignore it completely.  **Repro:**  1. Get targeted by Nether Strike or Assassinate 2. During their long cast time activate Shadow Realm  **Result:** Even though Shadow Realm was cast the enemy Sniper/Spirit Breaker continue casting their single target spell. The cast does not get canceled.  **Expected:** Just like how attacks cancel single-target spells should cancel when the target enters Shadow Realm.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E3i7pyhtE0)  ---  #9. Shadow Realm doesn't protect against Wrath of Nature and Omnislash bounces  There are 17 bouncing spells in the game. Shadow Realm prevents 15 of them from jumping on Dark Willow. Wrath of Nature and Omnislash are the only ones which can still jump on her.  The other 15 which cannot are:  Shuriken Toss Lightning Storm Chain Frost Moon Glaives Mystic Snake Spirit Lance Fade Bolt Laser Fatal Bonds Paralyzing Cask Death Ward Arc Lightning Harpy Chain Lightning Maelstrom/Mjollnir Chain Lightning  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ravcqhnakw)  ---  #10. Shadow Realm doesn't stop Dark Willow's attack orders when cast out of attack range  Shadow Realm works similar to Shadow Walk: When cast while attacking you automatically stop attacking as to not waste the damage boosted attack out of Shadow Realm.  However there is one issue. When you give Dark Willow and attack order so she first has to move closer to the target and then cast Shadow Realm while she is moving closer she will instantly attack and waste the spell completely.  As a comparison when the same is done with Shadow Blade the hero just moves within attack range and then stops there not attacking the target.  Shadow Realm should do the same. Instead of immediately attacking she should continue walking towards the target until within default attack range and then you have to give an attack order again to use the damage boosted attack properly.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gorY6W3A1-A)  ---  #11. Shadow Realm prevets several AoE spells from hitting Dark Willow  Shadow Realm is supposed to protect against targeted spells (and I suppose projectile based spells) and against attacks. But it currently also protects her against regular AoE spells. These spells are:  1. Aphotic Shield 2. Earthbind 3. Shield Crash 4. Stasis Trap 5. Overgrowth  They are all regular AoE spells Shadow Realm should not protect against them.  ---  #12. Shadow Realm's cast sound doesn't fade in/out upon gaining/losing vision over her  Usually spells like this have their sounds fade in/out when you gain/lose vision over the source (e.g. Stone Gaze and Unstable Concoction).  Shadow Realm should do the same. Currently it's either fully audible even after losing vision over her or it is completely silent when she cast it in the fog and then came within vision range.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sGJtrePDOg)  Also Terrorize's projectile could make use of this as well.  ---  #13. Shadow Realm's sound doesn't stop when getting dispelled  When Shadow Realm gets dispelled (by an AoE dispel) the sound effect of it continues and doesn't stop.  The sound should stop on dispel.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSAg75qbCrA)  --- --- ##Cursed Crown --- #1.  Cursed Crown pierces spell immunity when reflected back to the caster  It's a spell that does not pierce spell immunity by default. Therefore it still should not pierce it when reflected.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eApeUBB4CC4)  ---  #2. Cursed Crown's visual effect disappears when the target turns hidden  Cursed Crown turns completely invisible when the debuffed turn turns hidden.  The effects should stay visible at all times.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nmom_8pDeZI)  --- --- ## Bedlam --- #1. Bedlam is not visible in the HUD until Terrorize is learned and can't be leveled up  This is inconistent with every other spell which comes with multiple abilities.  1. Shadowraze: All 3 razes are visible at all times and you can level the spell by pressing either. 2. Whirling Axes: Both are visible at all times and you can level by pressing either. 3. Adaptive Strike: Both visible at all times can level by pressing either 4. Attribute Shift: You get the point  But then ther is Bedlam and Terrorize. You do not see Bedlam until Terrorize is leveld at least once. And you cannot click on Bedlam to level your ulti up you must click on Terrorize.  Bedlam should be visible at all times and not only appear after learning Terrorize. And you should be able to level your ulti by pressing either of the two.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_woxpqbb3e8)   --- --- ##Terrorize --- #1. Terrorize's pre-cast sound and visuals can be spammed endlessly  The spell has a loud sound during its cast time. That sound can be spammed endlessly. It should fade out upon canceling the cast like how e.g. Requiem of Souls does it. An enemy Dark Willow can spam it too. Both the cast and the area sound are audible to enemies.  The same goes for its visual effect. When spammed it can comletely blacken out portions of the ground.

Major bug with Medusa's Mystic Snake,self.DotA2,Medusa's Mystic Snake doesn't steal mana from illusions. It used to do it and it's not doing it anymore. It wasn't mentioned in the last few patch notes (6.86 or 6.87) so I presume it's a bug.  This means one of Medusa's ways to deal with illusions (HER MAIN COUNTER) just vanished for no reason.

Hero3: Everything wrong with Ancient Apparition part 2/2,self.DotA2,"[part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5v8lsa/hero2_everything_wrong_with_ancient_apparition/)  Here is part 2 covering other stuff like minor glitches inconsistencies inconveniences and some suggestions.  Note that most of these are not considered bugs. They are things that I think are hindering the hero unecessarily and would be nice if they were changed/tweaked. -  ---   #Part 2 of 2: Suggestions and other minor things.  ##[](/hero-ancientapparition) Ancient Apparition  * Total number of subjects: 22 * Number of bugs: 13 (previous post) * Number of minor issues: 5 (this post) * Number of other stuff: 3 (this post)  ^^^other ^^^stuff ^^^includes ^^^inconsistencies ^^^inconveniences ^^^and ^^^suggestions  ---  #1. Make Chilling Touch not slow upon attacking buildings/wards  The ability does not work against buildings and wards but it still slows your attack speed when attacking those.  For this reason the ability to manually remove the buff was added (left-click it to remove it). There is a much better solution to this though. It would be much more benificial for AA and his team when the buff would simply not slow your attacks upon attacking buildings or wards. It could work similar to Focus Fire which applies its effect only when attacking a specific target.  [Video demo of current behavior] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzB6BujsaRI)  ---  #2. Cold Feet's initial debuff has no visible timer on the status debuff icon  Expiring or timed modifiers usually indicate their duration on the ability icon. Cold Feet's initial debuff however looks like a permanent/passive/aura buff. It should show a timer like e.g. Last Word.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acfTITYiZDs) you can see how Last Word's debuff runs out in the status bar its red borders indicate the duration. Cold Feet does not do this.  ---  #3. Ice Blast cannot be leveled up while the Release sub-spell is active.  This is because of the issue mentioned in the first post it has only 1 level. However even if it would have 3 levels it needs to made levelable. Because some such spells cannot be leveled either despite having the correct amount of levels.  Other affected spells are:   * Nightmare * Tether * Astral Spirit * Illuminate * Illuminate (Spirit Form) * Song of the Siren * Icarus Dive * Sun Ray * Telekinesis * Chakram * Snowball  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1M5ieQuFXk)  ---  #4. Ice Blast's Release sub-spell does not have its own icon  It currently shares the same icon with Ice Blast itself. Most other sub-spells have their own icons.  Besides Ice Blast these sub-spells also share this fate (no own icon):   * X Marks the Spot's Return * Snowball's Launch Snowball * Primal Spring's Spring Early  The main issue here is new players may not notice that there is a sub-spell. How often does it happen that your Tusk doesn't launch his snowball earlier or your Kunkka doesn't return the target earlier? If it would have its own icon maybe they'd notice there is a new spell.  (PS: 3 out of 4 of these spells already have custom icons from cosmetic items they'd need fitting icons as well)  [Image] (http://i.imgur.com/hCHTOD3.jpg) on the left side we have all spell icons and the icons of their sub-spells. On the right side we have the 4 spells with no unique sub-spell icon (and the cosmetic item custom versions)  ---  #5. Enemies affected by Ice Blast can be denied by their allies/by neutrals  They cannot deny themselves while affected by Ice Blast AA gets the kill credits if the shatter was caused by self-inflicted damage. But allies can deny them still. The shatter only checks if it was self-inflicted damage.  According to DotA 1 only AA and his team should be able to get the kill credits. If the shattering was caused by the enemy an ally of the enemy or a neutral unit AA should get the credits.  This is a case where I think the DotA1 behavior was better. Because currently an enemy Oracle can easily prevent kills this way. Neutrals can be abused quite reliably as well.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMQ5HvtYH6A)  ---  #6. Ice Blast can debuff invulnerable units  Invulnerability should be a ""safe spot"" for units. And it basically is with only very very few spells being able to affect invulnerable units (such as Meat Hook). Ice Blast for some reason cannot be dodged with invulnerability.  It should not be able to debuff invulnerable units in my opinion so that it can be dodged like many other spells.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu6g0a_49IA)  ---  #7. Cold Feet does not have infinite charges in -wtf mode  Quite annoying. Charge-based spells are supposed to have infinite charges in free spells mode. But all spells which gain their charges do not have infinite charges.  Affected spells are:  * Cold Feet (charges gained via talent) * Homing Missile (charges gained via talent) * Rupture (charges gained via Aghanim's Scepter) * Demonic Purge (charges gained via Aghanim's Scepter)  All other charge-based spells have infinite charges. They are also charge-based from the beginning and don't gain it later on in a match.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fy2z_2PPKM)  ---  #8. Ice Blast's launch sound doesn't play when launched on death by Rubick or illusions  When the caster of Ice Blast dies the ice ball gets released immediately if it wasnt releasead yet. For Ancient Apparition it plays the launch sound when this happens. But for Rubick or illusions the launch sound is not played.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siLq5ZayGPA)  ---  #9. Tooltip stuff  Lots of tooltip stuff  **Cold Feet:**  - Cold Feet description could be reworded to be clearer. - Cold Feet has an unnecessary note telling its total damage - Cold Feet has an unnecessary note telling its tick interval (with an outdated value) - Add Cold Feet note telling that it can't be cast on units already affected by it - Add Cold Feet note telling that the spell completely cancels when walking out of range once - Change ""DAMAGE PER TICK"" to ""DAMAGE PER SECOND"" making the damage interval note redundant - Add ""CHARGE RESTORE TIME"" To the traits since the cooldown disappears once the charge talent is chosen leaving the player no info about how long it takes to recharge (it should only appear when the talent is chosen)   **Ice Vortex:**  - Reworded Ice Vortex description to tell that it reduces magic resistance (currently says it amplifies magical damage done against the target) and removed duration from description moved to traits - Remov Ice Vortex note saying that it doesn't affect spell immune enemies (tooltip header already tells spell immunity interaction) - Add Ice Vortex note telling Ice Vortex stacking behavior (doesnt stack) - Add Ice Vortex note telling about its 200 radius ground vision - Add Ice Vortex note about its debuff lingering - Chang ""INCREASED MAGIC DAMAGE"" to ""MAGIC RESISTANCE REDUCTION"" for accuracy and consistancy - Add VORTEX DURATION to traits   **Chilling Touch:**  - Remov duration and ""ancient apparition always receives the buff"" from Chilling Touch description (mov cd to traits and the other sentence to notes). - Reword Chilling Touch's first note about its damage being separate to be clearer - Reword Chilling Touch's second note about it only working against creeps and heroes to also tell its interaction vs units it doesn't affect (still applies slow) - Add Chilling Touch note telling it always buffs the caster (moved here from the description and reworded to not use hero names because Rubick) - Chang ""ATTACK SPEED: -20"" to ""ATTACK SPEED SLOW: 20"" - Add DURATION to traits  **Ice Blast:**  - Slighty reword Ice Blast description to say it prevents health regen and not regen in general (doesnt prevent mana regen) - Reword Ice Blast note about its aoe growth to be more clear - Add Ice Blast note about the initial tracer (visibility to enemies) - Reword Ice Blast note telling it only shatters heroes to it only debuffs heroes while creeps and illus are only hit by the impact damage - Reword Ice Blast note about its hp freeze to say all kind of heals instead of most - Expand Ice Blast note about its kill credit stuff - Change ""DAMAGE"" to ""IMPACT DAMAGE"" because it applies burst and dot damage and this trait is refering to the burst damage  **Release:**  - Add 3 levels to the Release sub-spell so ALT-clicking it shows the correct level (needs to be coded to level up together with Ice Blast)   **Modifiers:**  - Reword Cold Feet initial modifier to get rid of ""you"" and ""will"" - Reword Cold Feet stun modifier to get rid of hero names (because Rubick) - Add description to Cold Feet charges modifier copied from other charge-based spells' modifiers - Reword Ice Vortex modifier to say it reduces magic resistance to get rid of ""will"" and added values - Reword Chilling Touch modifier to get rid of ""will"" and to fit the style of most other modifiers - Reword Ice Blast modifier to get rid of ""will""  [Image] (http://i.imgur.com/4I09NSk.jpg)",bug

Followup on Void: There seems to be 3 major bugs which make void extremely strong.,self.DotA2,[My last post which you can read here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2ggj1z/the_real_problem_with_faceless_void/) was pretty controversial. I read through most of it to see what is really wrong with the hero. And while at it and surfing the DotaDev forums I noticed that Void has 3 major bugs relating to his Chornosphere initiation so I thought I would share this with you guys.  First bug is that Time Walk move too fast. http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=131837   Apparantly Time Walk travels equivalent to 3000ms instead of the intended 2600ms. That is a 1.15x increase compared to the intended speed. This makes it harder to react to a Time Walk initiation than intended.  Second bug is that Chronosphere is missing the intended 0.1 second buildup time. http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=113018   In WC3DotA void is suppose to have a 0.1 second buildup time before Chronosphere instead of it being instant (after cast point). This buildup time is kind of similar to Requiem Teleport or Primal Split in where you can actually disable the hero to stop the effect from occurring. This means that instead of a 0.35 cast point like his other skills he should essentially have a 0.45 cast point for Chronosphere. Combined with the above this makes reacting to a TimeWalk->Chronosphere much more difficult that in WC3DotA which probably is not intended.  Finally the third bug is where Chronosphere lingers for an extra 0.5 seconds than intended. http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=145653   This means that instead of 4/4.5/5 (4/5/6) second disable it is actually 4.5/5/5.5 (4.5/5.5/6.5) second disable which is actually a huge difference. It allows a Void with just MoM PT to get in an extra hit during the disable.  These bugs are actually a huge buff to Void and he might not even need a nerf if these are fixed. Please tell me your opinions.,bug

Please add this back; it was fun and created a lot of camaraderie when everyone on your team started spamming their chat wheel lines.,bug
(hopefully) all 7.06f bugs,self.DotA2,"4 bugs  #1. Tombstone unit health was not updated  The tombstone still has 6/8/10/14 health. It needs to be increased to 8/10/12/16 in order for heroes to need 4/5/6/8 hits. Currently it still dies to 3/4/5/7 hits  As you can see in [this image] (http://i.imgur.com/dunMoJs.png) it was updated in the ability file (which is for the description basically) but not in the unit file  [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0e7ZFM-kY0)  --- #2. Helm of the Dominator change was applied wrong  The changelog says ""*Helm of the Dominator: Attack Speed* ***Aura*** *increased from 10 to 15*"". However the change was wrongly applied to the passive bonus the owner gets instead of the aura bonus.   [image] (http://i.imgur.com/cZngU01.png)  ---  #4. Chain Frost does not get reflected by Lotus Orb/Spell Shield anymore  Previously Chain Frost got reflected upon projectile launch. It reacted on the initial mini-stun. Now that that stun is gone it fully bypasses Lotus Orb.  It should now trigger on projectile impact against the *primary target* just like how any other bouncing spell does (well.. except for Spirit Lance which was never fixed either)  [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL6XVE8w_2s)  ---  #4. Chain Frost tooltip still mentions a mini-stun  Nothing to add. Simple tooltip error.  [image] (http://i.imgur.com/hbzytq3.png)  ---  ###Bonus: As mentioned before Spirit Lance's interaction with Lotus/Linken's  Currently the spell gets blocked *completely* by Linken's Sphere no matter if it is the primary or a secondary target. It should either only get *fully* blocked when the primary target has Linken's or only gets its effects blocked (regardless of primary or secondary target) but continue jumping.  The same goes for spell immunity/invulnerability/hiding. Currently the projectile just fizzles away when any of the targets turn spell immune invulnerable or becomes hidden. In these cases its effects should get blocked but it should continue bouncing.  A few weeks ago Shuriken Toss got fully fixed in these regards. It had the exact same issues vs linkens/lotus/spell immunity/invul/hiding and it all got fixed for it.  In short: Spirit Lance should:  * not stop bouncing when blocked by Linken's Sphere on any target * ignore Lotus Orbs of secondary targets * not stop bouncing when any target turns spell immune before impact * not stop bouncing when any target turns invulnerable before impact * not stop bouncing when any target becomes hidden before impact * Why? Because it's literally the only bouncing spell which stops bouncing/procs secondary lotus orbs.  [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5z6r_7CEuk)",bug

Nightmare does not end upon taking attack damage  As we all know Nightmare is supposed to get canceled upon taking damage. However there is a source of damage which is completely ignored by it.  If you take attack damage while nightmared you do not wake up. This is heavily abusable with some heroes who have spells which force attacks. The following effects do not cancel Nightmare:  1. Any regular attack projectile (hitting after the invulnerability) 2. Sleight of Fist 3. Gyro's Side Gunner 4. Moment of Courage 5. Boundless Strike 6. Stifling Dagger 7. Assassinate 8. Geminate Attack  This is caused by some old remnant codes which are not needed by the spell. It is coded to ignore attack damage because as Bane was released Nightmare was transfered on attack hit not attack start. But since it was fixed to transfer on attack start it is no longer needed.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro4k9vzRny4)  ---  #2. Nightmare does not end upon taking damage from active attack modifier  This one is even weirder than the previous one. Attacks not ending it is kind of understandable how that happened. But this is not.  Damage done by *active* attack modifier (passive ones work fine) do not wake up nightmared units. This even includes damage over time effects.  Damage from the following effects do not end nightmare:  1. Petrify (Prowler Shaman ability) 2. Searing Arrows (hitting after the invulnerability) 3. Infernal Blade 4. Impetus (hitting after the invulnerability) 5. Burning Spear 6. Liquid Fire 7. Tidebringer 8. Arcane Orb (hitting after the invulnerability) 9. Glaives of Wisdom (hitting after the invulnerability) 10. Poison Attack  A very long time ago cleave had this bug as well where it bypassed nightmare and that was fixed. I assume it was bugged for all passive modifiers. Tidebringer is bugged again since it became an active attack modifier.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKfhSLu60OA)  ---  #3. Nightmare heavy inconsistency with bouncing & multi attacks  Nightmare's behavior with bouncing and multi attacks is a mess. So we have the following spells and this is how they interact with Nightmare:  1. Luna's Moon Glaives: Completely ignore nightmared units 2. Witch Doctor's Death Ward (upgraded): Fully affects nightmared units bouncing on them damaging and ending Nightmare upon damaging 3. Drow Ranger's Marksmanship (upgraded): Fully affects nightmared units bouncing on them damaging and ending Nightmare upon damaging 4. Medusa's Split Shot: Completely ignores nightmared units 5. Gyrocopter's Flak Cannon: Fully affects nightmared units targeting them but ending nightmare on attack launch not upon damaging 6. Shadow Shaman's Mass Serpent Ward (upgraded): Completely ignores nightmared units  So there are 2 differen behaviors either they affect them or they don't. The effects of these abilities are identical as well (especially moon glaives + death ward and split shot + flak cannon) them behaving differently in such regards isn't a good thing.  At least Moon Glaives + Death Ward should behave the same and Split Shot + Flak Cannon should behave the same. Also if Flak Cannon is kept this way it should at least end nightmare upon damaging not upon launching the attack.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmW5-4BTdWo)  ---  #4. Nightmare is not properly dispellable  Since 7.00 Nightmare is supposed to be dispellable. However its modifier is acting differently making it undispellable half of the time.  Normally a modifier appears as a buff when placed on allies and as a debuff when placed on enemies. This also decides who can purge stuff off of who. This is the default modifier/dispel behavior of the game. But Nightmare is *always* placed as a debuff no matter who it is cast on. As a result you cannot dispel Nightmare off of enemies.  The same bug (Nightmare always being placed as a debuff) also causes another bug where Bane can get assist points for dying allies. The assist system gives you points for any hero who dies which you put a debuff on. Since Nightmare always counts as a debuff a dying nightmared ally grants you assist points.  Furthermore the invulnerability modifier of Nightmare is undispellable. So if you purge Nightmare off the target still stays invulnerable for 1 second. Also strange the invulnerability modifier follows the default modifier rule: Appears as a buff on allies and debuff on enemies.  The image shows Nightmare cast on self. You can see the nightmare is red and the invulnerability is green. Both should be green when cast on self/allies.  [Image] (http://i.imgur.com/WPdwd9W.png)  [Video demo dispel interaction] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWa425k3Nh0)  [Video demo free assist points] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RZWVeYgn_M)  ---  #5. Nightmare triggers Linken's Sphere & Lotus Orb upon getting transfered  Linken's Sphere and Lotus Orb (and Spell Shield) are supposed to block/reflect spells targeted on you. So they should only react on Nightmare when Bane directly casts it on them.  But currently they also proc upon attacking a nightmared enemy unit. This should not happen. It causes the following issues:  1. When reflected it puts Bane asleep even when he was not nightmared. This can be abused to instantly disable Bane for a long time 2. When reflected Bane loses his Nightmare End sub-spell. For the rest of the game it only appears upon nightmaring self but not upon nightmaring others. 3. It is inconsistent. Only attacking nightmared enemies procs Linken's/Lotus. Attacking nightmared allies does not. It does not matter in which team Bane is. 4. It is also inconsistent with Bane's Scepter upgrade. Linken's/Lotus do not proc upon attacking Bane while he channels Fiend's Grip.  Attacking a Nightmared unit should not proc Linken's Sphere/Lotus Orb.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8wuchWmX54)  ---  #6. Nightmare's vision removal does not work against Monkey King  Nightmare sets your vision to 0 for its duration so that only your model is visible inside the fog while nightmared.  Currently this effect does not work on Monkey King while he sits on a tree. The vision effect of Tree Dance overrides Nightmare's effect.  As a comparison no other vision effect overrides it (moon shard darkness arctic burn lunar blessing shapeshift)  Monkey King should lose vision as well even while on a tree  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqIo218Uoyc)  ---  #7. Fiend's Grip deals too much damage based on player slot  Fiend's Grip is supposed to deal 5 (7 when upgraded) damage/mana drain instances  However based on player slot it deals 6 (8) instances.  * If Bane is in any of Radiant player slots Fiend's Grip deals 6 (8) instances against light blue and dark green 5 (7) against pink olive and brown. * If Bane is in pink olive or brown Fiend's Grip deals 6 (8) instances against all 5 Radiant slots. * If Bane is in light blue or dark green Fiend's Grip deals 5 (7) instances against all 5 Radiant slots.  Player slot should not matter it should always deal 5 (7) instances.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nMDuycfblk)  ---  #8. Bane does not get attacked by towers/wards while channeling Fiend's Grip  Whe scepter upgraded units are not supposed to auto-attack bane. But towers and wards which cannot be afflicted with Nightmare don't attack him either.  Units which cannot be nightmared should attack Bane normally.  Wards since they are player-controlled can still be ordered to attack him. But towers which are AI controlled never attack him.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13hnIaXdh8I)  ---  #9. Fiend's Grip does not fully pierce spell immunity  Fiend's Grip is supposed to pierce spell immunity. But its damage portion currently does not which causes several inconsistencies.  As a comparison Dismember (which is essentially a short Fiend's Grip) does fully pierce including its damage. So it still can cancel Recalls on spell immune targets and Blade Mail still reflects its damage when the target is spell immune.  Fiend's Grip does not deal its damage at all despite piercing spell immunity. It should apply its damage normally.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wItBNyvuIzo)  ---  #10. Casting multiple Fiend's Grips on one target causes it to malfunction  An issue which only matters in same hero mode or when Bane and Rubick cast it on the same neutral creep  Currently casting Fiend's Grip on an already gripped unit interferes with the first cast. The first cast stops draining mana and stops dealing damage. The scond cast takes over the debuff. However when either of them end the other gets canceled as well. So if the first caster cancels his cast the 2nd caster stops as well but continues channeling nothing.  Each cast of Fiend's Grip should place its own independent debuff on the target.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U9tA6xDZ0w)  ---  #11. Bane illusions have lvl 1 Nightmare when spawned while the sub-spell is active # ALT-clicking Nightmare always says it's level 1 when done while the sub-spell is active  This happens because the sub-spell has only 1 level instead of having 3 levels like the main spell.  **Repro:**  1. Have Nightmare on level 2 3 or 4 2. Cast Nightmare 3. Spawn illusions of Bane while Nightmare is still running 4. Also ALT-click Nightmare meanwhile  **Result:** The illus have level 1 Nightmare instead of 2/3/4. ALT-clicking it also says it's on level 1 instead of 2/3/4.  **Expected behavior:** Illus should copy the correct level. ALT-clicking should also show the correct level. The sub-spell should have 4 levels like the main spell and its level should be set equal to Nightmare's level.   Other spells with the same bug:  * Tether * Ice Blast * Telekinesis * Song of the Siren  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPzeN12RyJY)  ---  #12. Nightmare cannot be leveled up while the sub-spell is active.  This is because of the issue mentioned in the first post it has only 1 level. However even if it would have 4 levels it needs to made levelable. Because some such spells cannot be leveled either despite having the correct amount of levels.  Other affected spells are:   * Ice Blast * Tether * Astral Spirit * Illuminate * Illuminate (Spirit Form) * Song of the Siren * Icarus Dive * Sun Ray * Telekinesis * Chakram * Snowball  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1M5ieQuFXk)  ---,bug

Drunken Brawler ensured evasion does not work at all  Straight-forward. The ensured crit timer procs but does not evade the attack.  **Repro:**  1. Learn Drunken Brawler 2. Get attacked by an enemy  **Result:** The attack puts the ensured evasion on cooldown (icon turns yellow). But the attack is not evaded at all.   **Expected:** If the attack had no True Strike it gets evaded by the ensured evasion.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RYrP2jiXXo)  ---  #2. Drunken Brawler's ensured crit malfunctions when attack-canceling  This used to work for a while after the ensured crit was added. It got broken about a year ago. The ensured crit simply does not proc anymore when attack-canceling too often.  This bug heavily cripples Brewmaster's last-hit abilities during the laning stage. The supposed reliable crit is unreliable.  **Repro:**  1. Learn Drunken Brawler 2. Start an attack on an enemy but cancel it a few times before hitting 3. As a  comparison when ready again cancel the attack once and hit with the  2nd attack  **Result:** The ensured crit is not applied when attack-canceling at least 3 times quickly. It does get applied when canceling once or twice.   **Expected:** The ensured crit should be applied no matter how often the attack gets canceled.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N2jVl6rsoM)  ---  #3. Primal Split Earth gets stuck when Primal Split splits during knockbacks   Potentially game-breaking. The Earth element cannot move after Primal Split resolves during a non-disabling knockback (deaf blast es pull or kick ghostship drag etc) which makes it pretty much useless and also easier to kill.  **Repro:**  1. Begin casting Primal Split 2. During the cast time get hit by Deafening Blast 3. Time it so that the split finishes during the knockback  **Result:** Earth gets stuck on the hidden Brewmaster presumably because the knockback cancels Primal Split's periodic movement of Brewmaster.   **Expected:** Earth is not stuck. Band-aid solution: turn Brewmaster phased during Primal Split  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHJC6ZzlnMw)  ---  #4. When Primal Split ends during Walrus Punch/Kick Brewmaster's facing angle is messed up  Also potentially game-breaking as this bug can make you virtually ""invisible"" when timed right although intentionally timing it is something that probably won't happen since it would be a disadvantage for Tusk's team. What happens here is as Primal Split expires Brewmaster's facing angle is set equal to the element he respawns on. This includes the z direction. Walrus Punch/Kick change your z direction as well to create that rotating effect so when expiring during it Brewmaster may face up/downwards or even backwards.  **Repro:**  1. Wait until the last second of Primal Split's duration 2. Before the spell expires cast Walrus Punch/Kick on the element Brewmaster will appear on 3. Time it so that the spell expires while the spirit is in the air  **Result:** Brewmaster's facing angle equals *exactly* that of the element so that it may face up/downwards or even be spinned entirely so that he now is under ground.   **Expected:** Brewmaster's x/y facing should copy the element and z should not  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTig4DGgH2M)  ---  #5. Box-selecting the Primal Split spirits doesn't always put Earth as first  One of the most common and annoying things on Brewmaster. The order of his elements is sometimes messed up. It sometimes selects Storm over Earth while it should always select Earth over Storm. Fire is correctly always the last.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Primal Split 2. Check whether you have to TAB to Earth  **Result:** Sometimes the order is Earth->Storm->Fire sometimes it's Storm->Earth->Fire   **Expected:** It should always be Earth->Storm->Fire  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwwb3MqjmhU)  ---  #6. Thunder Clap uses creep duration vs creep-heroes instead of hero duration  One for AdmiralBulldog I'm sure he knows this too well.  Usually when a spell has a hero duration and a creep duration it uses the hero duration for creep-heroes. But Thunder Clap uses the creep-duration for creep-heroes.  **Repro:**  1. summon a spirit bear 2. hit it with Brewmaster's thunder clap 3. check how long it lasts  **Result:** The slow lasts 8 seconds using creep duration   **Expected:** The slow should lasts 4 seconds using hero duration  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_zWBXStwLk)  These spells also use creep duration: frost arrows brood spider poison sting spells of neutrals  As a comparison these use hero duration: Storm Cyclone BB goo timelock dismember demonic purge slardar bash  ---  #7. Primal Split's periodic moving of Brewmaster can be canceled by teleports  Brewmaster can get teleported during Primal Split. Some of you may say that this is intended but I'd like to disagree here.  One argument is ""you can use this to save your Brewmaster"". And here is why this is a bad argument:  Respawning at the tp location might sometimes be a good thing. If you cast Primal Split to prevent death it makes an easier escape. However to do this your ally has to time his teleport which is not that easy during fights. And Primal Split on its own should already be enough to keep you alive. You have 3 different units and only one of them has to survive. One of them is tanky the other one has invisibility and a strong disable and the last one runs very fast. The teleport doesn't make a significant difference here because either way you have to keep at least one spirit alive. So if you know that they won't be able to kill all 3 spirits anyway you don't need to worry about surviving so the tp was unnecessary. If you know they can kill all 3 spirits you have to keep one alive regardless of whether you got tp'd or not.  Here are other disadvantages of getting teleported:  * Auras are no longer bestowed around your spirits. The spirits don't scale well into the late game since they are non-scaling units. Therefore items like Assault Cuirass Vlads and Radiance or defensive items like Shiva's Guard or even Gem of True Sight are important for the spirits in the late-game. Getting teleported away also takes away the auras from the spirits making them significantly weaker and may allow enemies to escape easier (e.g. with invisibility if you were holding the gem). * You stop gaining experience from kills happening around your spirits. Usually kills happen where you cast your ultimate so when you get teleported away you will miss out on a lot of gold and xp if you don't get any last hits. You won't get any xp or gold when your hero sits at the foutain thanks to Chen's tp while your spirits fight somewhere on the map. * The ensured vision around your spirits is lost. If you have vision-impairing enemies like Bane your hero's vision doesn't help when it sits at the fountain. It would help when it was centered on the spirits still.  **Repro:**  1. Cast a teleporting spell on Brewmaster (Chen Kotl Wisp Underlord or Disruptor) 2. Quickly Cast Primal Split before the teleport resolves  **Result:** When the teleport resolves after the split it ends the periodic movement of Primal Split   **Expected:** The periodic movement should not get canceled Primal Split should pull Brewmaster back immediately  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgxQVblwMSE)  ---  #8. Drunken Brawler ensured crit procs & gets wasted on units it can't crit  This should not happen because it makes as much sense as being able to target e.g. magic missile on a spell immune unit. It does nothing but waste the cooldown. Other passive abilities which cant affect certain units do not go on cooldown against them either. For example Jinada doesn't go on cd vs wards or buildings so why should Drunken Brawler?  As a comparison the ensured crit was fixed to not get wasted on missed attacks. Simlarly the ensured evasion got fixed to not get wasted on attacks with True Strike.  **Repro:**  1. Learn Drunken Brawler 2. Attack an ally a ward or a building  **Result:** Ensured crit procs on things it cannot crit getting wasted   **Expected:** Ensured crit should not proc on things it cannot crit  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pucj7qDFhlE)  ---  #9. Brewmaster does not re-appear exactly at Earth's location upon expiring  A very minor thing. When Primal Split ends Brewmaster is supposed to appear at the spirit's location (Earth->Storm->Fire). But due to collisions Brewmaster gets pushed aside after re-appearing putting about 50-100 range off-set.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Primal Split 2. Wait for it to expire 3. Closely observe Brewmaster's position compared to the spirit he appeared from  **Result:** Brewmaster gets pushed aside after re-appearing due to collsion. Does not happen when re-appearing on Fire due to it being permanently phased or when re-appearing on Storm under Wind Walk due to Wind Walk granting phase.   **Expected:** Brewmaster should not get pushed aside. Band-aid solution: Make Brewmaster phased during Primal Split  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W7HwbfC8jw)  [image for better readability] (http://i.imgur.com/jUOoobt.jpg)  ---  #10. Rubick does not get de-selected when casting Primal Split  During Primal Split the caster is supposd to be unselectable. This does not work for Rubick currently.  **Repro:**  1. Steal Primal Split with Rubick 2. Cast Primal Split with Rubick  **Result:** Rubick stays selected and can be still selected afterwards   **Expected:** Just like Brew Rubick should not be selectable during Primal Split attempting to do so should redirect the selectiont o the 3 spirits  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMOOb1FFvec)  ---  #11. Shadow Walk/Wind Walk/Shadow Blade/Vendetta apply dmg to every hit during fade time  I know many of you do not consider this a bug because it has been like this since Brewmaster existed in Dota 2.  Wind Walk applies its damage to every hit during its fade times without breaking the invisibility allowing you to apply its damage multiple times with a single cast.  For Storm this means you can double the damage out put per cast which extremely boosts its damage output. The spell has a mere 4 seconds cooldown and does 220 backstab damage on level 3. So when done right you can dish out about 300-500 (2x backstab+2x att dmg and considering some armor reduction) damage per Wind Walk cast every 4seconds which is a huge damage boost.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Wind Walk with Storm 2. During the fade time perform an attack  **Result:** The attack performed during the fade time applies the backstab damage without breaking the invisibility so the backstab can be used again   **Expected:** The backstab damage is only applied on attacks done after the fade time. Attacks done during the fade time should not apply the damage just like how attacks done during the fade time don't break the invisibility  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npGwiYUxWCs)  Note: Bounty Hunter Shadow Blade and Nyx Assassin (not relevant as of now but might be in the future) have this bug as well.  ---  #12. Fire's Permanent Immolation is not disabled by Break  It's a passive ability. It should be disabled. There is no reason not to. As a comparison Earth's Demolish is disabled.  **Repro:**  1. Hit the Fire element with Silver Edge 2. Stay within Immolation's range  **Result:** Permanent Immolation continues to damage nearby units during Break   **Expected:** Break should disable Permanent Immolation  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tE1KvNFhiA)  ---  #13. Stashed items cannot be locked while having creep-heroes selected  For some reason locking and unlocking items for combining requires your current selected unit to have an inventory which makes no sense. So you can still normally drop or sell stashed items while having your brewlings selected but you cannot lock/unlock them.  **Repro:**  1. Have a creep-hero selected 2. Attempt to lock or unlock stashed items  **Result:** Items cannot be locked while having units without inventories selected   **Expected:** Item locking should not depend on whether the unit can carry items or not  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl29gZEmG0w)  ---  #14. Storm Cyclone can be cast on Roshan wasting mana/cd & causing audio bug  Cyclone uses a loop sound. So when it gets instantly dispelled it gets stuck because it is bound  to the debuff and doesn't register it getting dispelled when it happens immediately. Roshan has 100% disable resistance so it gets immediately dispelled.  This is also somewhat abusable. You can use this to check whether Roshan moves in his pit since the sound can be heard  through the fog by allies.  **Repro:**  1. Break Roshan's Spell Block 2. Cast Storm's Cyclone on Roshan  **Result:** Cyclone is castable on Roshan doing nothing but wasting cd and mana and getting its sound stuck   **Expected:** Cyclone should not be castable on Roshan or at least the loop sound shouldnt get stuck  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DUnP0hj4gI)  ---  #15. Can't reflect some projectile spells back when the caster is spell immune  Lotus Orb is supposed to reflect projectile-based spells even when the original caster is spell immune. The projectile would then fizzle (or apply its aoe effect if it has one) on them when still spell immune on impact but would fully affect them if the immunity wears off before impact.  **Repro:**  1. Get a Lotus Orb and cast it on self 2. Have a spell immune enemy 3. Have that spell immune enemy cast one of the following spells on you: Rod of Rod of Atos Adaptive Strike Hurl Boulder (Mud Golem) Hurl Boulder (Primal Split Earth)  **Result:** Lotus Orb does not reflect the spell. No projectile is launched.   **Expected:** Lotus Orb should reflect the spell launching the projectile back and eventually affect it or fizzle depending on whether they are still spell immune on impact or not.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbWAaLV80Ok)  --- --- --- ## Tooltip stuff ---  **Thunder Clap:**  1. Description says ""enemy land units"" but it affects flying units as well. The ""land"" part should be removed. 2. Typo in the +2s Thunder Clap talent it says ""Thunderlap"" instead of ""Thunder Clap"" 3. The +75 damage and +2s duration talent bonuses are not added to the tooltip (+2s should be added to hero and creep duration) 4. The Earth element's Thunder Clap is unable to show the talent bonuses (just adding the linking stuff to the ability in the npc file does not work)  **Drunken Haze:**  1. Has sentence structure repetition (""causing their... causing their"") 2. Doesn't mention cast range in traits  **Drunken Brawler:**  1. Doesn't say that it pierces spell immunity in the header 2. Says ""avoid attacks"" instead of ""evade attacks"" 3. Second sentence for the guaranteed crit/evasion is completely out of style (using ""you"" and ""will"") 4. Trait says ""DODGE CHANCE"" instead of ""EVASION"" or ""EVASION CHANCE"" (items and other abilities say ""EVASION"")  **Primal Split:**  1. When holding Aghanim's Scepter All of the spirits' spell are 1 level too high and show level 4 while on level 3. Their tooltip orange glow stops working as well. Only Fire's Permanent Immolation is limited correctly to 3 levels. 2. Add ""SPLIT TIME"" to the traits below the ""DURATION"". 3. Drop the ""adept at survival"" part of the first sentence. It makes no sense (and we need to shorten it a bit based on the following things) 4. Change ""the end of their summoned timer"" to ""the end of their duration"" (more shortening for the following) 5. Add descriptions for the 3 elements briefly tell what their spells do. Use color-coding similar to Elder Dragon Form (see image for example) 6. Add text to the Primal Split modifier it's currently blank. Best would ""If any of them survive until the end of their duration the Brewmaster is reborn."" copied from the spell description.  **Summons abilities:**  1. All of their spells could make use of better descriptions as the current ones are lacking mainly in style. 2. None of their spells have lore texts. 3. Hurl Boulder Cyclone & Dispel Magic: missing cast range in traits 4. Wind Walk: Doesn't say it pierces spell immunity in the header 5. Wind Walk: Doesn't mention FADE TIME in traits  ALT note suggestions:  **Drunken Brawler:**  * New ALT note: Guaranteed evasion does not work against True Strike * New ALT note: Fully works for illusions including the guaranteed crit/evasion  **Primal Split:**  Rework the ALT notes:  * First note should say that Brewmaster is periodically moved along with the elements in this order assuming they are alive: Earth->Storm->Fire * Second note should say that all of Brewmaster's auras are bestowed around the element he currently follows (current note says that auras always follow Earth which is incorrect) * Third note should say that Brewmaster takes the place of the element he followed the last * New ALT note: The 3 spirits are treated as heroes and are ancient creeps  **Summons abilities:**  * New Hurl Boulder ALT note: Can be disjointed * New Dispel Magic ALT note: Affects invulnerable units * New Wind Walk ALT note: Damage is directly added to Storm's attack damage (works with crits and lifesteal) * New Wind Walk ALT note: Actions performed during the fade time don't break the invis  [Image comparing the changes to the current tooltips] (http://i.imgur.com/LSE4rms.jpg)  [dota_english and npc_abilities changes can be found here] (http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=281466)  ---",bug
Bug: Riki's ult does one less attack than it should at each level,self.DotA2,I was testing something in demo mode when I noticed this. I restarted the demo multiple times and found that although the ult may give the correct number of attacks initially it will eventually start giving one less. It appeared as though the attacks were happening at the x.8 second marks of the channeling instead of the x.0 marks.,bug
"The ""Tiny Avalanche neutrals stacking"" bug explained",self.DotA2,[Regarding this post] (https://np.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6fx3es/possible_tiny_avalanche_glitch/)  First off it has nothing to do with Avalanche. A level 3 Tiny simply cannot block that specific camp at all. He is *outside the spawn box*.  How is this possible? Two factors:  1. Tiny's base model is a [tiny squared pebble] (http://i.imgur.com/M3VV5tD.png). This square is always at his chest area so when skilling Grow it gets higher off the ground.  2. Neutral creep spawn boxes are 3-dimensional. And some of these new neutral creep camps have very short boxes while all of the old ones and some of the new ones have tall boxes.  The medium camp in Dire's secondary jungle has the shortest box of them all. It is so short that a Tiny with level 3 Grow cannot block it because his base model is outside of the box.   [In this album] (https://imgur.com/a/4cbMv) you can see the heavy discrepancy between the spawn box sizes.  [This is the box of the dire secondary forest medium camp] (http://i.imgur.com/7mmO72P.jpg) which levle 3 Grow Tiny cannot block. As a comparison [this is the radiant secondary forest large camp] (http://i.imgur.com/K35wh27.jpg) which cannot be stacked with any spell since nothing throws units that high not even a lethal Walrus Punch.   Fixing these should be extremely easy. It just needs a size adjustment on the z axis to the boxes. Best would be when all boxes had the same height so that torrent/tornado-stacking them would be consistent.,bug

Ice Blast prevents Track from granting gold  When a hero dies to Ice Blast's shatter while Tracked by Bounty Hunter it does not grant Track gold to anyone.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Track on an enemy 2. Apply Ice Blast frostbite debuff on the enemy 3. Cause it to shatter by dropping its health below the threshold  **Result:** Track does not grant any gold. The shatter prevents it.   **Expected:** The shatter should not prevent Track from granting gold.  This is the same bug which causes Duel to not grant damage Reaper's Scythe to not credit Necro Tempest Double not grant its bounty etc. That dispel effect should really be removed from Ice Blast as it creates way more bugs than it fixes.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVu_hjcb6FI)  ---  #2. Track does not grant gold to nearby invulnerable or hidden allies  Track is supposed to grant gold to allies which are within 900 range of the target. This works independent from the speed buff it places. However this does not work when the ally is invulnerable or hidden within range.  This works fine for Gondar himself who always gains the gold even while invulnerable or hidden.  **Repro:**  1. Pick Storm Spirit 2. Have an ally track an enemy 3. Have the enemy on low health 4. Finish the enemy of by using Ball Lightning's aoe damage  **Result:** Even though you are directly next to the enemy and even killed them you do not gain Track gold because you were invulnerable during Ball Lightning.   **Expected:** The gold should be granted regardless of your current status.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBD3cBzLFNU)  ---  #3. Track's speed aura affects neutral creeps  Track's AoE speed aura is set to affect ""enemies of the debuffed target"" instead of ""allies of the debuff source"". This means it affects neutrals as well.  **Repro:**  1. Get tracked by an enemy Bounty Hunter 2. Walk past neutral creeps 3. Check the neutral creeps' status bar and movement speed  **Result:** The neutrals are affected by the speed aura.   **Expected:** The speed aura should only affect Bounty Hunter and his allies.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1jTGNPewBo)  ---  #4. Shuriken Toss bounces ignore invisibility even after dispelling Track  Shuriken is disjointable. Therefore it should not hit invisible units. This works fully fine when being the primary target of the Shuriken.  But when being a secondary target thanks to Track it *will* hit you even if you dispel the track and then turn invisible. It will even hit Slark who uses Shadow Dance or when using Smoke.   **Repro:**  1. Cast Track on Slark. 2. Use Shuriken Toss on a hero within range of Slark. 3. After the Shuriken bounces and starts flying towards Slark cast Shadow Dance  **Alternative repro:**  1. Cast Track on an Legion Commander 2. Use Shuriken Toss on a hero within range of Slark. 3. After the Shuriken bounces and starts flying towards Legion cast Press the Attack to dispel Track 4. Still before the projectile hits cast Shadow Blade with Legion  **Result:** In both cases despite being no longer revealed to the enemy and being invisible Shuriken still hits damaging and stunning you   **Expected:** The shuriken should get disjointed as soon as the target is no longer revealed no matter how.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayuJf10bB4k)  ---  #5. Shuriken Toss procs Linken's Sphere/Lotus Orb of secondary targets  Linken's Sphere and Lotus Orb are only supposed to proc when being the primary target of a single-target spell. Currently they proc on the bounces of Shuriken Toss as well. This makes Linken's Sphere hard-counter his Scepter upgrade since it will make it stop bouncing. Lotus Orb is even worse and can reflect multiple shurikens with a single cast.  As a comparison other bouncing spells don't proc Linken's Sphere or when they proc they don't stop bouncing. None of them proc Lotus Orb as secondary targets.  **Repro:**  1. Pick any hero and buy Linken's sphere/Lotus Orb 2. Have a enemy Bounty Hunter and get tracked by him 3. Get hit as a secondary target by Shuriken Toss  **Result:** Linken's Sphere blocks the shuriken so that it does not continue to bounce to other tracked heroes. Lotus Orb reflects the shuriken. If you add Aghanim's Scepter to Bounty Hunter Lotus Orb may reflect it a second time if it bounces back on you again.   **Expected:** Shuriken Toss should proc Linken's Sphere only when primary target. In this case it should stop it from bouncing as well. It should completely ignore the spheres of secondary targets. Lotus Orb should also only proc when primary target and ignore bouncing shurikens.  **Note:** Spirit Lance has this bug as well.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH5U-9H5aL8)  ---  #6. Shuriken Toss does not bounce off of or to spell immune heroes  This issue here is what makes Bounty's Scepter upgrade so weak. The Shuriken will stop bouncing when one of its targets turned spell immune. As a comparison any other bouncing spell (Chain Frost Mystic Snake Paralyzing Cask) continue to bounce even when their current target turned spell immune. Forthermore they also can jump onto spell immune units using them as ""bridges"" to continue jumping. Shuriken Toss does not do this.  **Repro1:**  1. Have 2 enemy heroes one of them with BKB 2. Cast Track on the non-BKB enemy 3. Cas Shuriken on the BKB enemy 4. Activate the BKB before projectile impact  **Repro2:**  1. Have 2 enemy heroes one of them with BKB 2. Activate BKB on the enemy 3. Cast Track on the BKB'd enemy 4. Cast Shuriken Toss on the non-BKB enemy  **Result:**   1. The projectile does not bounce off of the now spell immune enemy. It completely disappears. 2. The Shuriken does not bounce onto the spell immune tracked enemy. It completely ignores it.   **Expected:**   1. The projectile should bounce off of them without harming it in any way (no damage no stun). Spell immunity should not disrupt the shuriken's bouncing. 2. The projectile should bounce towards the tracked enemy regardless of spell immunity. It should not harm it though (no damage no stun). From here it should be able to bounce off to other tracked heroes again.  **Note:** Spirit Lance has this issue as well.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjNhjvVhpOE)  ---  #7. Shuriken Toss does not bounce off of invulnerable or hidden heroes  Similar to above but only one way. Bouncing spells continue bouncing even when their current target turns invulnerable or hidden. Shuriken Toss completely fizzles instead. This again heavily increases the amount of heroes who can turn his aghs upgrade useless and allows heroes to easily counter it with eul's scepter. So as of now his aghs upgrade is only good aganist a team which does not use spell immunity invulnerability or hiding which is quiet rare.   **Repro:**  1. Pick Bounty Hunter and level up Shuriken Toss and Track 2. Create an enemy Outworld Devourer and Bane 3. Cast Track on any of them 4. Cas Shuriken on the same enemy 5. Have the enemy cast Astral Imprisonment/Nightmare on self before the projectile reaches them  **Result:** The projectile does not bounce off of the now hidden or invulnerable enemy. It completely disappears.   **Expected:** The projectile should bounce off of them without harming it in any way (no damage no stun). Being hidden or invulnerable should not stop the shuriken from bouncing to other nearby valid targets.  **Note:** Spirit Lance has this issue as well.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvCJ2tKBC4)  ---  #8. Shuriken Toss not bouncing properly if recast before 1st cast finishes  Another bug which cripples a caster Bounty Hunter.  Shuriken Toss is supposed to bounce between tracked units once (twice when upgraded). This works fine until you throw a second shuriken before the first one finishes.   **Repro:**  1. Track multiple enemy heroes 2. Cast Shuriken Toss 3. Cast Shuriken Toss again  **Result:** The 2nd cast resets the bounce counter of the first cast so that it can now jump on units it already jumped on again. The second cast ends prematurely together with the first cast.   **Expected:** Each cast should work independently from each other. Each released Shuriken should bouce exactly once (twice when upgraded) on each nearby tracked enemy.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MTteuBQHvk)  ---  #9. Shadow Walk applies damage to every hit during its fade time   I know many of you do not consider this a bug because it has been like this since Bounty existed in Dota 2. But it does qualify as a bug according to what the spell tells us it is supposed to do. Also this was fixed for Silver Edge after its release indicating it's not intended.  Shadow Walk applies its damage to every hit during its fade times without breaking the invisibility allowing you to apply its damage multiple times with a single cast.  For the early game this means you can put out more damage by leaving Shadow Walk on level 2 since the longer fade time allows you to get off the attack. This means on level 2 you can deal 120 damage per cast instead of 60 30 damage more than you could deal on level 3. In the late-game you can dela 240 damage per cast instead of 120. When combined with Echo Sabre you could even pull of a 3x damage by attacking twice during the fade time and 1 more time to break the invis dealing 360 extra damage total.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Shadow Walk 2. During the fade time perform an attack  **Result:** The attack performed during the fade time applies the backstab damage without breaking the invisibility so the backstab can be used again.   **Expected:** The backstab damage is only applied on attacks done after the fade time. Attacks done during the fade time should not apply the damage just like how attacks done during the fade time don't break the invisibility.  **Note:** The following spells have this bug as well:  1. Shadow Blade's Shadow Walk (even worse since ranged heroes can do this too) 2. Brewmaster's Storm's Wind Walk (a giant damage boost here because its backstab damage is 220 and it has a 4 second cooldown. This is 440 damage per cast doable up to 3 times per Primal Split massing up to 1320 damage) 3. Nyx Assassin's Vendetta (technically. But due to its lack of fade time this is *currently* not abusable. If it ever gets a fade time added then this will be extremely strong.)  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npGwiYUxWCs)  ---  #10. Shadow Walk's invisibility is lost on attack hit instead of launch  This matters for ranged heroes only. When Rubick attacks out of Shadow Walk he remains invisible until the projectile hits. As a comparison almost other sources of invisibility break on attack launch not hit.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Shadow Walk as Rubick 2. Attack an enemy 3. Check the timing of the invisibility loss  **Result:** The invisibility is lost on projectile impact.   **Expected:** Just like any other source of invisibility the invis should be lost on projectile launch.  **Note:** Vendetta Nature's Guise and Meld have this bug as well. It is especially noticable with Meld as this bug allows her to even *move during meld* from projectile launch to impact.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ3tvomCov0)  ---  #11. Shadow Walk's invisibility does not break on missed attacks  Related to the above issue this is because of the timing of the spell.  All sources of invisibility break when the attack out of the invis misses the target (due to evasion or blind) or have True Strike. Gondar's Shadow Walk is the only one which does not break on missed attacks.   **Repro:**  1. Cast Shadow Walk 2. Attack an enemy Windrunner during Windrun 3. Do the same with other sources of invisibility as a comparison  **Result:** Shadow Walk remains active after the missed attack. Other sources of invis break on the missed attack.   **Expected:** Shadow Walk should break on missed attacks as well.  **Note:** Vendetta and Nature's Guise technically have this bug as well but it does not matter in these cases due to the True Strike they grant.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3heIP901I)  ---  #12. Shadow Walk's invisibility does not break upon attacking items  Again related to the 2 above caused by the timings.  Attacking items while invisibility breaks the invisibility since you attacked something. However this does not the case for Shadow Walk where you remain invisible despite having performed an attack.   **Repro:**  1. Pick one of the mentioned heroes and level up the mentioned spell 2. Turn invisible with the mention spell 3. Attack an item while invisible 4. Now do the same with any other source of invisibility as a comparison  **Result:** The invisibility of Shadow Walk is not broken upon attacking items. The invisibility of almost any other source does break upon attacking items.   **Expected:** All sources of invis which break on attacks should break upon attacking items as well. These 3 should not be a random exception to this.  **Note:** Just like before Vendetta and Nature's Guise have this bug as well.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0_fgNtxkL8)  ---  #13. Jinada goes on cooldown in -wtf mode  The -wtf mode is supposed to disable cooldowns. Jinada still goes on cooldown though. It should not.   **Repro:**  1. Turn on -wtf mode 2. Attack with Jinada  **Result:** Jinada goes on cooldown.   **Expected:** Jinada's Cooldown should not trigger.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siwnh7zkDpY)  --- --- --- ## Tooltip stuff ---  1. Shuriken Toss' stun durations are not shown anywhere (default and aghs durations) 2. Shuriken Toss' Scepter text does not say that it increases the stun duration 3. The +75 Shuriken damage talent bonus is not added to the tooltip value 4. Add cast range to Shuriken Toss (Track already has this) 5. Jinada is missing its spell immunity information at the header of the tooltip box 6. Track doesn't say that it grants vision over the target (only says true sight) 7. Track's debuff does not tell what it does. Currently there is only text for how much gold you are carrying.   ALT note suggestions:  **Shuriken Toss:**  * Note0 ""The initial target does not need to be tracked for the Shuriken to bounce."" (replaces current note saying it interrupts channeling spells which is unnecessary)  **Jinada:**  * Note0: ""Illusions cannot use Jinada."" (new note)  **Shadow Walk:**  * Note0: ""Does not interrupt channeling spells on cast."" (rewording already existing note which is currently not very accurate) * Note1: ""Deals its damage in a separate instance so it is not included in Jinada's or any other critical strike lifesteal or cleave."" (expanding note to include all crits cleave and lifesteal) * Note2: ""Actions performed during the fade time do not break the invisibility."" (new note)  **Track:**  * Note0: ""Bounty Hunter always gets the bonus gold regardless of distance to the target."" (rework note) * Note1: ""Allies receive the gold only when within 900 range of the target."" (rework note) * Note2: ""It doesn't matter how the target dies the gold is always granted."" (new note) * Note3: ""Track's particle effects are only visible to allies."" (make clear that only particles are not visible the debuff is) * Note4: ""Bonus gold is reliable gold.""

MKB bash override Abyssal bash,self.DotA2,Despite the statement on dota2wiki saying that MKB bash is fully independent from other bashes (http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Abyssal_Blade) I found that if MKB and Abyssal bashes proc in the same attack  only the bash from the first aquired item will be performed.  It could be easily tested :   1) buy 5 MKBs  2) buy 1 abyssal (you have first to buy the 5 MKBs)  3) attack a hero and observe that Abyssal never proc (actually it can proc if none of the 5 MKBs proc but this is very rare : 0.25(1-0.35)^5 =3%)  this means that if you have both items in real game (1 MKB and 1 abyssal) and if abyssal is acquired after MKB then you lose 35% of the abyssal bashes.  the same is true for Abyssal overriding MKB if you have aquired MKB after abyssal you loses 25% of the MKB bashes  you can always change the items priority by droping an item.  (I have posted this 2 years ago and I just saw that this is still not fixed so maybe it's intended but then I also found that MKB fully works with void troll bashes and both can proc in the same attack so why not fully stack also with abyssal),bug
List of Pangolier bugs,self.DotA2,"These are all the bugs I found in the last 2 days on Pangolier.  If you know about more post them here.  ##**Pangolier**  --- --- ## Swashbuckle --- #1. De-selecting Swashbuckle also gives Pangolier a move order  Normally when you deselect a spell with a right-click it does just that and nothing else. But if you deselect Swashbuckle while the targeting vector is active the right-click also sends Pangolier a move order on top of deselecting the spell.  **Repro:**  1. Select Swashbuckle 2. Select a target point for the cast 3. Before letting the mouse key go right-click to deselect and cancel the spell  **Result:** The right-click deselects it as expected. But it also sends Pangolier a move order.  **Expected:** The right-click should only cancel the spell if you do not have the ""[Move After Ability Target Cancelled] (https://i.imgur.com/IQmTLVa.png)"" option turned on.  (throwing this in here the Scan ability has the same issue)  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2biXSdzSY9E)  ---  #2. Swashbuckle's vector targeting doesn't behave like a ground-targeted spell.  For this you need to have Quick Cast and ""Quick Cast on Key Down"" turned on. With this setting you have to press two keys to cast Swashbuckle. Press the spell hotkey to target a point and then press left mouse button to determine the vector direction.  However if you left-click to target the direction of the spell it behaves as if you have no spell selected. This means if there is a unit under your cursor you select that unit and deselect your hero.  Sounds complicated? Just compare it to e.g. Magnus' Shockwave. Imagine whenever you cast Shockwave onto an enemy the enemy gets selected because it was under your mouse cursor. Would be annoying right? This is what currently happens with the vector targeting of Swashbuckle.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBDPb7ZBCDA)  ---  #3. Swashbuckle's targeting vector indicator doesn't disappear when selecting other spell during it  When you are about to cast Swashbuckle selected the targeted point but did not release the mouse button yet and then select another spell before letting the key go Swashbuckle gets deselected but the targeting vector stays. It stays until you select the spell again.  Even worse when doing this the targeted point does not reset either. If you want to cast he will use the previously selected point as the start location.  Even worse when done with Rubick the vector can get permanently stuck on the ground. For this to happen you have to lose the spell after doing the above steps.  **Repro:**  1. Select Swashbuckle 2. Left-click to select a target point but do not let the button go 3. While holding the mouse button select any other targeted spell  **Result:** The targeting vector gets stuck.  **Expected:** The vector disappears. And the target point variable resets (so that the next attempted cast doesn't go to the previously canceled location)  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7LCtzHNc-o)  ---  #4. Swashbuckle works with Splash Damage (Rubick Swashbuckle + Elder Dragon Form)  Swashbuckle does not work with Cleave for the same reason why Boundless Strike doesn't: it would deal tons of damage due to how cleave works  However Splash fully works with it. When Rubick casts Swashbuckle during Elder Dragon Form he deals tons of damage if he hits more than one enemy  **Repro:**  1. Steal and cast Elder Dragon Form 2. Steal Swashbuckle and cast it so that you hit many units  **Result:** EDF's Splash activates on each hit enemy on each hit.  **Expected:** Swashbuckle should not trigger splash.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mffC3pkBAb4)  ---  #5. Recasting Swashbuckle before the previous cast finishes messes the previous cast's attack location  Your typical multi-spell instance bug.  When you cast Swashbuckle (more like give cast order) a second time during an ongoing cast the ongoing cast's damage/attacks are applied where you targeted the new cast.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Swashbuckle 2. During the dash give the cast order again targeting a new spot  **Result:** After the dash the old cast releases the attacks where you targeted the new cast. This is global you can target it anywhere and the attacks will go there.  **Expected:** Obvious the new cast should not override the target point of the previous cast.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2TAaZX_PgI)  ---  #6. Swashbuckle does a 5th attack during the dash hitting some enemies he dashes over  Swashbuckle does 5 attacks instead of the listed 4. The first attack happens towards the end of the dash behind the targeted area. The 4 others happen where they are supposed to happen.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Swashbuckle so that you dash over some enemies  **Result:** The enemy you dash over gets hit by an attack. This attack is not part of the 4 attacks after the dash.  **Expected:** No attacks happen during the dash. Or if this is intended add it to the description of the ability.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stmdVuj4GY4)  --- --- ##Shield Crash --- #1. Shield Crash completely ignores ethereal units  This is one of the weirdest things currently. Shield Crash a regular magical damage AoE spell with a self-buff does not affect ethereal enemies. It neither even attempts to damage nor does it count ethereal units for the self-buff.  It should not ignore ethereal units.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMIQp71FyD4)  ---  #2. Shield Crash gets canceled when getting dispelled during the jump  When you get dispelled during the jump of Shield Crash the jump gets completely canceled. This makes no sense. Dispels aren't supposed to cancel spells.  The shield_crash_jump modifier should not be dispellable (except by death).  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS1vuZrMttY)  --- --- ##Heartpiercer --- #1. Heartpiercer works against armor reductions as well  This is the most nonsense part about this ability.  Heartpiercer sets the target's armor to 0 regardless of anything. This means if the target has *negative armor* Heartpiercer will set it to 0 completely working against stuff like Desolator Assault Cuirass SF aura Solar Crest etc. Heartpiercer basically *grants* the enemy armor in this case.  I want to throw in here that Elder Titan's Natural Order and the Ancient Prowler Shaman's Desecrate (aoe slam) have this issue as well.  ---  #2. Heartpiercer does not change bonus armor value in the HUD (UI bug)  Heartpierce completely negates *ALL* your armor. This includes your base armor armor gained by agility and any other green bonus armor you have. But in the HUD only your main armor (base armor + agi bonus) gets set to 0. The green bonus value is not changed giving the wrong impression that bonus armor works against Heartpiercer which it does not.  [Here you can see] (https://i.imgur.com/OrSTVfS.png) a Sven with and without Heartpiercer debuff. With the debuff his HUD shows 0+10 implying that the 10 armor are still working during it. [Here you can see] (https://i.imgur.com/8zgDH3S.png) Slardar using a level 1 Slithereen Crush against that same Sven. Once before Heartpiercer and once after. You can see that the second cast did full 75 damage so the 10 bonus armor are negated by Heartpiercer as well.  The HUD should reflect this. The green + armor should not be there during Heartpiercer.  ---  #3. Heartpiercer doesn't change the armor value of non-heroes (UI bug)  Similar to before but this time for non-hero units. Heartpiercer *does* negate their armor as well but the armor value in the HUD is completely unchanged.  [Here you can see] (https://i.imgur.com/jpP71mN.png) a Centaur Khan showing 4 armor despite the Heartpiercer debuff.  --- --- ##Rolling Thunder --- #1. Rolling Thunder doesn't end when getting Assimilated/entering a Snowball  When you get Assimilated by an allied Lifestealer during Rolling Thunder you still apply the AoE knockback/damage to nearby enemies. Slark can just walk up to people and you perma-stun them with Rolling Thunder from within Lifestealer.  Similarly Snowball doesn't end Rolling Thunder either. When entering Snowball you still apply the AoE effect on from inside the Snowball on enemies the Snowball rolls over.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Rolling Thunder 2. While rolling have an allied Lifestealer cast Assimilate on you or enter an allied Snowball  **Result:** You continue hitting enemeis with Rolling Thunder from within Lifestealer/The snowball  **Expected:** Rolling Thunder should end upon entering Lifestealer/Snowballs  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEdCR9efBjk)  ---  #2. Rolling Thunder doesn't dispel Pounce and Deafening Blast's disarm  Pounce and Deafening Blast's disarm are undispellable except by spell immunity. BKB Blade Fury Rage Life Break and Repel all can dispel both of them. But Rolling Thunder also granting spell immunity and dispelling Pangolier cannot dispel Pounce and Deafening Blast's disarm.  It should be able to dispel both of them as well.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WcOe4yavw)  ---  #3. Rolling Thunder's animation doesn't end when the spell does  When the spell ends the animation of it continues/restarts. Pangolier curls himself up in a ball and floats in the air until given a new order.  [Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssMrA9s8Lag)  ---  #4. Rubick uses Pangolier's voices during Rolling Thunder  When colliding with a cliff some voice lines of Pangolier play. This voice lines are currently not coded as responses but rather as sound effects of the spell. This means when Rubick casts it he uses Pangolier's voice when bumping into walls.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pL0qV0c6B8)  ---  #5. Rubick's Rolling Thunder model is rotated by 90 and is inside the ground  Rubick's Rolling Thunder model faces the wrong duration and is halfway inside the ground.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHovICr_oko)  ---  #6. Rolling Thunder does not get canceled by some spell immunity piercing stuns  The following spells stun their targets even through spell immunity but yet are unable to stop Rolling Thunder:  1. Flaming Lasso 2. Dismember 3. ~~Meat Hook~~ forgot this one Meat Hook's stun doesn't pierce spell immunity 4. Walrus Kick 5. Black Hole 6. Chronosphere 7. Greater Bash 8. Primal Roar knockback 9. Toss throw  All of these should end Rolling Thunder since it is supposed to stop when stunned during it.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4LXf9xOFzU)  ---  #7. Rolling Thunder bounces off of Sprout trees instead of destroying them  Rolling Thunder is supposed to plow through trees and destroy them. But yet Sprout trees are not destroyed when hitting them from inside the tree ring but are destroyed when hit from outside the ring.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqKnGuPNdz4)",bug

Phoenix and Brewmaster can't gain Assist Gold while using their Ultimates.,self.DotA2,On the current version of Dota 2 Phoenix and Brewmaster aren't able to gain Assist Gold from hero kills that happens while they are using their ultimates.  This means that when they use their ultimates at the climax of teamfights they won't be able to get any gold except from heroes / units they kill.  Because of that their item growth potential over the game is severely hindered even if they do well in the game. Phoenix is even a hero with lots of Damage over Time skills so the chance of Phoenix getting last hit on heroes during her ultimate is very low.  They also can't gain Urn of Shadows charges while they are using their ultimates and Urn of Shadows is a great item on them who are able to gank / kill early game and are strength heroes.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVS2cxGvjZs  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2wjswkVjqg  It should be noted that it is unlikely that this will be changed because it works the same way on DotA 1 from Warcraft 3 I thought of posting this here to gather some attention because I think it hurts the gameplay and hinders their competitive viability.,bug

Since Valve wants to fix their game can we talk about one of the biggest game breaking bugs in the game that has been in since 6.84? Yes 6.84.,self.DotA2,"Okay guys hear me out. The hero that is most affected is my beloved techies. I know I know but don't destroy me just yet. Valve has killed this hero. It is almost inarguably the worst hero in the game right now and through strange nerfs and just leaving the hero alone since the nerfs techies is in a real bad spot.  That's fine honestly with me. If valve wants his landmines to be gold factories for supports and his remote mines to not scale in dmg with int like all other spells that's okay too. Leave techies in the trench.  There is a bug however that affects his gameplay and cannot be intentional. Since 6.84 a LONG time ago they added WK aghs and it ruins techies' game. When techies' mines kill a hero who respawns as a green ghost due to WK aghs when they really die it will count as a suicide and not a kill for techies.  This means if techies gets a rampage on a team with a WK with aghs it will be a 5 man suicide. If valve wants to make his abilties shit and make him very very difficult to play that's okay. If valve wants to make reports count more so people who instinct report techies players I can't stop that and neither can they so that's fine too.   But please. Don't let them get killed by this bug anymore. Those three little bastards are the most lovable trio in doto and I hate to see them hit even harder by a bug SINCE 6.84!  Thank you for your time and if you made it here cheers friend.  ""What did you guys do with your break?"" ""Uh I think I was dead"" ""Oh"" -Techies respawn line  TL DR: Techies mine kills on heroes who respawn with WK aghs will count as suicides not kills. Has been broken since WK aghs added in 6.84.",bug

Raising awareness on an 6 year old invoker bug.,self.DotA2,This ~~developer intended feature~~ bug has been around since source 1.   *   Basically if you invoke a spell and cast it quick enough the previous spell is cast instead [imgur](http://imgur.com/a/7ppPZ). On the gif i'm shifting 3 orbs+d(that's the easy way to show the bug). Every time the previous spell is cast before moving to the F bind. *  Some of you might have noticed this with fast ghostwalk invoke and cast in your games. I personally love to do invoker traning before i start my games(invoking and casting 10 spells in a row on wtf). * Also i'm sick and tired of casting the wrong spells just because dota can't handle my cast speed. You can call it a skill cap but i literally have to wait 0.3-0.5 sec after invoke not to fuck up.  It's not about ping i tested it on localhost.  * Edit. Here's a good slowmo video of the problem [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vGNvzabIKE) thx to JBay7 for providing the link. * P.S. Legacy keybinds have the same effect as df.,bug

Razor and His $80+ Genuine Golden Severing Crest Glitched Since Reborn - Devs Don't Care,self.DotA2,reddit  I've been playing Razor exclusively [since 2013](https://yasp.co/players/16558517/matches) and have over 2000 games with him so naturally unpatched bugs related to the hero tend to bother me more than others. I've been documenting and posting these bugs on the dev forums for years and nothing has changed.   I purchased a Genuine Golden Severing Crest a little over a year ago.  Since reborn people on the enemy team have been claiming my Golden Severing Crest isn't golden. Instead some people only see the item as a regular blue Severing Crest.  Today I was able confirm the glitch.  Moo was streaming today and thanks to lucky matchmaking I got to play Razor against him (while wearing my Golden Severing Crest). When I watched the Twitch replay guess what I saw?: https://www.twitch.tv/moodota2/v/85487881?t=02h19m43s   This is bullshit considering **the price and rarity of the item is based solely on the missing golden effect**.   Also am I the only one who notices the new glitchy flurry of electric effects all around Razor's chest since TI6?

Recently Valve fixed the midlane-pull abuse with spells like Boulder Smash. The fix however created a new problem regarding auto-attacks,self.DotA2,"Recently the devs fixed some cases where spells could be abused to knock neutrals towards the Dire mid lane in order to pull the lane ([here one example] (https://np.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5yue19/earth_spirit_full_midwave_pull_on_dire/)). They did this by making the spells place the ""*modifier_disable_aggro*"" modifier on the pushed neutral creep. This modifier causes the creep to be completely ignored by auto-attacks.  **The problem is this modifier does not only work against lane creeps. It also causes player-controlled units to be unable to auto-attack the creep.**  What this means is any nearby allied player-controlled unit using auto-attack will fully ignore that creep. This even includes attack-move orders. To attack that creep the ally must directly target the unit with an attack order. This can be a significant issue when fighting Roshan since he is a neutral creep as well. If you e.g. cast Telekinesis on Roshan allies using auto-attack will stop attacking Roshan and have to be given a direct attack order from their controlling players which can cost several seconds  Spells using this modifier and therefore causing auto-attack issues are:  1. Earth  Spirit - Boulder Smash 2. Rubick - Telekinesis 3. Pudge - Meat Hook 4. Morphling - Adaptive Strike 5. Clockwerk - Power Cogs 6. Chaos Knight - Reality Rift 7. E: forgot to mention Tiny - Toss  **[In this video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W931F3BpcNU)** you can see how Telekinesis makes the Chaos Knight and Rubick stop attacking Roshan for several seconds (6 seconds the duration of the modifier) and alter in the video the same in the neutral creep camp. Reality Rift and the spells listed above cause the same effect.  ##**The best way to fix this would be to make that modifier only affect non-player units so that it only makes lane creeps/towers ignore the pushed creeps and not player-controlled units.**",bug

Hero16: Everything wrong with Chaos Knight part 1/1,self.DotA2,"[Links to heroes 1-10] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/69xpnn/hero11_everything_wrong_with_bounty_hunter_part_12/)  Hero 11: Bounty Hunter [part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/69xpnn/hero11_everything_wrong_with_bounty_hunter_part_12/) [part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6a27m1/hero11_everything_wrong_with_bounty_hunter_part_22/)  Hero 12: Brewmaster [part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6gpdef/hero12_everything_wrong_with_brewmaster_part_12/) [part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6hbt1i/hero12_everything_wrong_with_brewmaster_part_22/)  Hero 13: [Bristleback] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6n59ke/hero13_everything_wrong_with_bristleback_part_11/)  Hero 14: Broodmother [part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/70qxpz/hero14_everything_wrong_with_broodmother_part_12/) [part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/70yjz0/hero14_everything_wrong_with_broodmother_part_22/)  Hero 15: [Centaur Warrunner] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/728fpc/hero15_everything_wrong_with_centaur_warrunner/)  --- ##[](/hero-chaosknight) Chaos Knight  * Total number of subjects: 22 * Number of bugs: 6 * Number of visual glitches: 8 * Number of cosmetic item issues: 5 * Number of suggestions: 2 * +1 tooltip stuff  --- ##Bugs ---  #1. Several spells prevent units from auto-attacking the spell target for several seconds  Recently some cases where spells could be abused to knock neutrals towards the Dire mid lane in order to pull the lane got fixed. It was done by making the spells place the ""*modifier_disable_aggro*"" modifier on the pushed neutral creep. This modifier causes the creep to be completely ignored by auto-attacks.  The problem is this modifier does not only work against lane creeps. It also causes player-controlled units to be unable to auto-attack the creep. This means your and allied units can no longer auto-attack the target which is bad.  **Affected spells are:**  1. Chaos Knight - Reality Rift 2. Clockwerk - Power Cogs 3. Earth Spirit - Boulder Smash 4. Morphling - Adaptive Strike 5. Pudge - Meat Hook 6. Rubick - Telekinesis 7. Tiny - Toss  **Repro:**  1. Cast one of the named spells on a neutral creep 2. Let auto-attack try to do its work  **Result:** Auto-attack does not target that creep for some time.  **Expected:** The disable aggro effect used by these spells should not affect player-controlled unit.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4UkreJlbr8)  ---  #2. Phantasm malfunctions when getting Aghanim's Scepter during cast time  When you acquire Aghanim's Scepter during the cast time of Phantasm the spell goes on cooldown and expends mana but does nothing at all besides that. It gets completely wasted.  **Repro:**  1. Start casting Phantasm 2. Acquire Aghanim's Scepter during the cast time  **Result:** Phantasm does nothing but expend mana and go on cooldown.  **Expected:** When aghs is required the spell should still do what it is supposed to. When no target is given it should default to the caster instead of doing nothing.  **Note:** Weaver's Time Lapse has this bug as well. Eclipse Supernova and Enchant Totem work fine.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG2KRm2kbi8)  ---  #3. Phantasm Mirror Image and Manta Style illusion formatting issue  Illusions are always spawned using the same pattern:  * First illusion: To the east of the unit * Second illusion: To the north of the unit * Third illusion: To the west of the unit * Fourth illusion: To the south of the unit  This goes for *every* illusion that spawns.  On top of this Phantasm Mirror Image and Manta Style also shuffle the units' position. This shuffling however has an issue currently. It happens in between the illusion spawns. This means depending on when the main hero gets shuffled some illus spawn based on the caster's original location while the remaining illus spawn based on the caster's new location. This breaks the formation.  **Repro:**  1. Just cast a level 3 Phantasm or Mirror Image several times and observe the formations.  **Result:** Depending on when CK is positioned the formation can either be fine or broken.  Let's use CK as an example level 4 Phantasm and always spawning 4 illusions. This are the possible results:  * CK gets positioned as first then the 4 illus spawn. [Result] (https://i.imgur.com/0P3YOzf.png). * An illusion spawns first then CK gets positioned then the remaining three illusions spawn. [Possible results] (https://i.imgur.com/tv8Ig6d.jpg). * Two illusions spawn first then CK gets positioned then the remaining two illusions spawn. [Possible results] (https://i.imgur.com/AqNjXWL.jpg). * Three illusion spawns first then CK gets positioned then the remaining one illusion spawns. [Possible results] (https://i.imgur.com/6XojmSR.jpg). * All four illusions spawns first then CK gets positioned. [Possible results] (https://i.imgur.com/fBSy12L.jpg).  **Expected:** The positions should always be based on CK's original position and not change in between the spawnings.  Alternatively ditch the formatting and make it completely random positions within a radius around the cast locaton. Chaos all the way.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKHteDHndXk)  ---  #4. Reality Rift doesn't reliably make CK and the target face each other  Reality Rift is supposed to make Chaos Knight and the target face each other. This feature is even mentioned in the ability. However currently the target most of the time immediately turns away to face wher it was facing before. Chaos Knight and his illusions do this as well if the target cannot be attacked.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Reality Rift on an ethereal enemy 2. Observe Chaos Knight's (and his illus') facing direction  **Result:** Chaos Knight faces the target but then automatically and immediately returns to his previos facing direction. Same for his illus. The target also turns away back to where it was facing before (happens if its last order was not a stop or hold command the ethereal part doesnt matter here).  **Expected:** Reality Rift makes Chaos Knight and the target face each other (and make CK's illus face the target) and keep it that way until CK or the target are given an order which requires them to turn. Units should not automatically turn back to their original direction when forced to turn a different direction by a spell.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55sC5-_WwVg)  ---  #5. Reality Rift's armor reduction does not update on refresh  When recasting Reality Rift on the target only the duration gets refreshed. The armor reduction value does not update.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Reality Rift on a target 2. Level up the ability 3. Re-cast it on the same target before the previous cast expires  **Result:** The debuff duration is refreshed but the armor reduction is not updated.  **Expected:** The armor reduction should update to current level on refresh.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BSPIBKp050)  ---  #6. Using Phantasm on Phantasm illusions creates illusions with 1 HP  Usually when the Phantasm target dies during the split time the spell gets canceled. This is the intended behavior. However this does not happen when targeting Phantasm illus.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Phantasm on a unit 2. Cast Phantasm again but on an illusion of the previous cast  **Result:** After the split time the previous illus get killed off and then 1 HP illusions spawn.  **Expected:** Since recasting Phanasm kills the previous illus it should cancel the Phantasm cast. Better yet it should not be able to target Phantasm illus.  Alternatively choose the inconsistent way and make it spawn the illus with the targeted illu's hp before it gets destroyed.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU-DQUEXkuQ)  --- --- --- ## Suggestions ---  #1. Give Phantasm illusions a red skin instead of using default blue  Phantasm illusions look exactly like e.g. Manta Style or Illu Rune illusions despite being like 10 times more powerful than them. Also having them all the same color is not user friendly in general. Units with different traits should look differently. Chaos Knight's illusions are not the same as Manta illusions so they shouldn't look alike.  **Note:** The color would still be allied-only. This would make no difference for enemies since they see the illusions like the original hero. This would only be a QoL change for the player and their allies.  [Here is an example of a red illusion] (https://i.imgur.com/GCIk8ZO.jpg)  ---  #2. Give Reality Rift's debuff its unique effect instead of copying Medallion  Reality Rift's debuff currently uses the same particle effects on the target as Medallion of Courage does. Not only is this unfitting to his color theme it can also cause confusion since it looks exactly like medallion's effect.  A simple recolor of the medallion effect would already suffice here. A new effect altogether would be better though.  [Here is an in-game example of an effect] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhT6UgISYkk)  --- --- --- ## Visual glitches ---  #1. Chaos Bolt's stun duration display over the target is inaccurate  Chaos Bolt shows the stun duration it randomed above the target along with the random damage. This display is currently inaccurate because it rounds the value to the next integer.  For example if stuns for 2.5 seconds it will show 3 above the target 0.5 more than it did. When rolling 2.4 seconds it will show 2 above the target 0.4 less than it did.  It should show at least 1 decimal or even 2. When stunning for 3.64 seconds it should show 3.6 or 3.64 and not 4.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEhsVp4Q0hc)  ---  #2. Reality Rift particles play on allied illus when having shared control  When casting Reality Rift it creates the particle effect and plays the sound on *every illusion Chaos Knight has control over*. This includes allies who have shared control enabled.  The particles and sound should only play on illusions owned by Chaos Knight since it can only pull those.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1hSFcvEjg)  ---  #3. Several heroes have no teleport animation  Most heroes have a teleport animation. They were added over the years during the beta but suddenly got stopped being added. From the 114 current heroes 81 have a teleport animation and 33 don't. Chaos Knight is one of them.  The following heroes I already made posts for have this issue as well: Abaddon Brewmaster and Bristleback  For a full list of affected heroes [see here] (http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=284692).  Every hero should have a tp animation.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqB-BRb10sE)  ---  #4. Reality Rift's cast animation & sound don't cancel upon canceling cast  When canceling a spell cast the animations usually reset to the idle animation and if it has a pre-cast sound effect that sound fades off quickly.  However Reality Rift does neither of these. The cast animation always gets fully finished even when the spell gets canceled. Its sound always completely finishes as well instead of fading off. Only the particle effects get canceled properly.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-38Y4GJQ6oc)  ---  #5. Rare idle animation plays during injured phase  While injured Chaos Knight should not use his rare idle animation since it clashes with his injured idle animation. He has 1 rare idle animation which can currently play while injured.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mup7XIE8zWE)  ---  #6. Spawn animation has 9 empty frames at the beginning  The first 9 frames of Chaos Knight's spawn animation are completely identical so that CK is basically frozen at the beginning of the animation. They should be removed.   [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW3ugJxVT54)  ---  #7. Chaos Bolt has an unnecessary screen shake effect on the projectile  Chaos Bolt currently has a screen shake effect attached to the endcap effect of the projectile. This screen shake is only applied to the targeted player.  Why is this redundant? Because the fact that you get stunned already causes your screen to shake. The projectile's screen shake is a second shake on top of that.  Why should it be removed? Because currently if you avoid the projectile's effects by e.g. turning spell immune invulnerable or hidden before impact or by blocking it with Linken's Sphere your screen will shake anyway which makes no sense since you avoided it.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYh_P8fKaSY)  ---  #8. Reality Rift doesn't make CK's illusion play the cast animation  When casting Reality Rift all illus of Chaos Knight within 1375 range are pulled along with Chaos Knight. However the illusions do not play the Reality Rift animation. They just stand still and wait to get teleported.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlTK7ib3wUQ)  --- --- --- ## Cosmetic item issues ---  #1. Chaos Hound Set's item pieces are not marked as set pieces  The pieces are not marked as set pieces but are wrongly marked as bundle items.  [Here you can see a comparison to a properly set item set] (https://i.imgur.com/R21tvv4.jpg)  ---  #2. The mount of the Chaos Hound set makes hoof sounds despite being a hound  Chaos Knight has one mount which is not a horse: It's a hound. But it still uses the default movement sounds of Chaos Knight which are hoof sounds. The hound should use different footstep sounds.  When looking through the currently in-game footstep sounds I think Mirana's sounds fit the most to the hound. The foley sounds should stay the same (since the armor and stuff are still there) only the footstep sounds would need replacing.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6xIyahHSKQ)  ---  #3. Blade of Burning Turmoil & Cudgel of Baleful Reign use default particle  The weapons of the Arms of Burning Turmoil and the Charge of Baleful Reign sets use Chaos Knight's default weapon particle effect.  The effect does not fit those items. It should be disabled for these two. Other custom weapons on which the effect doesn't fit already have it disabled.  [Image showing how the particles are out of place] (https://i.imgur.com/AMGPq2M.jpg)  ---  #4. Several custom weapons don't use the default particle effects   There are some custom weapons of Chaos Knight which were designed so that the default weapon particle effect still fits them.  These items have designated holes on the weapon where the particle effect is supposed to be. But the particle effect is missing on them. This goes for the following items:  1. Blade of Chaos Incarnate 2. Hellfire Edge  Furthermore the following items although not having a designated spot are built so that the default particle effect still fits them well  1. Blade of Discord 2. Infernal Shredder 3. Waraxe of Lost Light  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-AVUXRYgpU)  [Image showing how the particles fit perfectly] (https://i.imgur.com/daKfN9l.jpg)  ---  #6. Lots of Chaos Knight's cosmetic items are missing backfaces  A lot of Chaos Knight's cosmetic items are missing backfaces. Most of them are from the sets.  Note: Yes backfaces are left out intentionally for not-visible places. This report is spots visible in the hero loadout and via the default camera angle.*  The following items are missing backfaces  **1. [His default set] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XS67pOEzhjQ):** Mount shoulders and pants  **2.

Several changes that weren't mentioned in 7.07 or 7.07b patch notes,self.DotA2,**EDIT:** Several things were fixed and as such confirmed to be bugs. This also implies that Bane and Lone Druid nerfs were intentional and not bugs.  **EDIT 2:** Lone Druid transformation time got fixed as well.  **EDIT 3:** Valve fixed most of the tooltip bugs.  *****  Several undocumented changes were made in patches 7.07 and 7.07b. Some of them maybe be accidental bugs but no way to know for sure if they were intended or not.  **Items**  * ~~Meteor Hammer still does 60/115 DPS when it was supposed to be nerfed to 50/90 (building/units)~~ * ~~Necronomicon 1: Manacost reduced from 50 to 0 (Levels 2 and 3 still have 50 manacost)~~  **Heroes**  * Bane: Enfeeble can no longer target creeps * ~~Lone Druid: Druid Form transformation time increased from 0.8 to 1.933~~ * ~~Tinker: Heat-Seeking Missile damage rescaled from 125/200/275/350 to 120/200/280/360~~ * ~~Venomancer: Movespeed was reduced by 15 from 285 to 270. Of this 5 was for being agility hero and another 5 was mentioned in the patch notes meaning his move speed got reduced by extra 5 without mention~~  **Creeps**  * Centaur Courser (small) move speed reduced from 350 to 320 * Satyr Banisher (small) move speed reduced from 330 to 300 * Satyr Banisher (small) attack range reduced from 300 to 280 * Satyr Banisher (small) acquisition range reduced from 300 to 280 * Satyr Mindstealer (medium) acquisition range reduced from 500 to 300 * Satyr Tormenter (big) acquisition range reduced from 500 to 300 * Hill Troll (small) attack range reduced from 350 to 250 * Hill Troll (small) acquisition range reduced from 300 to 250 * Dark Troll Summoner (big) movespeed reduced from 320 to 300 * Dark Troll Summoner (big) attack range reduced from 350 to 250 * Dark Troll Summoner (big) acquisition range reduced from 300 to 250  These creep changes might be from the aggro and pulling changes but they were not mentioned nonetheless.  In addition several tooltips with talents and scaling cast ranges are lacking. This is some of them but I probably missed even more cases.  **Tooltips**  * ~~Alchemist: Chemical Rage BAT with talent doesn't update since it is mistakenly tied to bonus hp regen internally~~ * ~~Broodmother: Spin Web positive buff is missing % for move speed~~ * ~~Dazzle: Shadow Poison cast range scales with levels but this isn't mentioned anywhere even after the rework~~ * ~~Dazzle: Shadow Poison move speed slow is missing %~~ * ~~Drow Ranger: Gust silence duration with talent recently got fixed but the tooltip updating part is still tied to her old silence skill~~ * ~~Invoker: Tornado with lift time talent doesn't update~~ * ~~Keeper of the Light: Mana Leak cast range tooltip still says 550/700/850/1000 instead of 400/500/600/700~~ * Magnus: Reverse Polarity stun duration with talent doesn't update * ~~Morphling: Attribute Shift bonus agility/strength was buffed from 3/4/5/6 to 4/5/6/7 but tooltip wasn't updated~~ * ~~Oracle: Fate's Edict cast range scales with levels but this isn't mentioned anywhere~~ * ~~Phoenix: Launch Fire Spirit sub-ability duration is 16 instead of 20~~ * Phoenix: Launch Fire Spirit sub-ability damage with talent doesn't update * Warlock: Fatal Bonds damage with talent doesn't update * ~~Warlock: Shadow Word cast range scales with levels but this isn't mentioned anywhere~~,bug

Flaming Lasso break range isn't based on the distance between Bat & target  Flaming Lasso's break distance is based on how far Batrider moved in an instance. So even if you blink towards your lasso target the lasso breaks. Vice versa you can do short blinks away from the target without breaking it instantly pulling it over a short distance.  **Current behavior:** Lasso breaks when Batrider instantly moves 425+ range into any direction.  **Expected behavior:** Lasso breaks when distance between Batrider and Lasso target gets greater than 425.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWheLB3bMdY)  ---  #2. Flaming Lasso breaks when target gets insta-moved regardless of distance  When the target gets affected by any sort of instant movement (TPs but also stuff like reality rift x mark & glimpse) the lasso breaks regardless of how far the spell moved it. So even a 0 range glimpse breaks the lasso.  **Current behavior:** Teleporting the target breaks the lasso regardless of distance.  **Expected behavior:** Teleporting the target 425 range away from Batrider breaks the lasso. 0 range teleports or teleporting closer to Bat doesn't break the lasso.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqL3mxJOimA)  ---  #3. Flaming Lasso gets canceled by Dismember & Walrus Kick  Dismember fully cancels Flaming Lasso on cast. Walrus Kick also cancels it unlike other sources of forced movement.  **Current behavior:** Casting Dismember or Walrus Kick on a lassoed unit breaks the lasso  **Expected behavior:** Neither Dismember nor Walrus Kick should break the lasso. Lasso should have priority.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwJE4apcnnU)  ---  #4. Flaming Lasso causes Geomagnetic Grip to stop working until the target dies  Geomagnetic Grip stops working on a unit completely when cast on it once while lassoed.  **Current behavior:** Geomagnetic Grip's buff gets stuck when cast on lassoed targets preventing future grip casts from affecting the unit.  **Expected behavior:** The buff should instantly disappear when the target can't be moved.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiuVhSPG4M)  ---  #5. Flaming Lasso interaction with Chronosphere  Based on cast order Flaming Lasso causes Chronosphere to malfunction on lassoed units. It works fine with Chronosphere affects the target first but not when Lasso affects it first. The bug allows the target to use insta-cast spells like BKB or Refraction in between the disables.  **Current behavior:** When lasso is cast first Chronosphere fails to apply its debuff so that once the lasso expires the target can cast spells before Chronosphere finally freezes it.  **Expected behavior:** Regardless of cast order Chronosphere should freeze the target (it still should not cancel the lasso though).  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ93BNFoSa0)  ---  #6. Aghs' secondary lasso doesn't break when the primary lasso gets dispelled  The secondary aghs lasso is supposed to break when the primary target is freed. This currently does not work when dispelling the first lasso. It does work when the target is freed in other ways.  **Current behavior:** Dispelling the lasso from the primary target does not end the secondary lasso.  **Expected behavior:** Dispelling the lasso from the primary target should also end the secondary lasso.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYmDXeqk370)  ---  #7. Flaming Lasso disarm ends when first lasso cast ends instead of last cast  When lassoing multiple enemies the disarm timing is off. The disarm disappears when the first lasso expires or gets dispelled instead of lasting until all lassoes coming from Batrider end  **Current behavior:** Lasso self-disarm lasts until first lasso ends.  **Expected behavior:** Lasso self-disarm stays until all lassoes coming from Batrider end.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reyi3J0RCHQ)  ---  #8. Upgraded Flaming Lasso stops dealing damage when refreshed on targets  Flaming Lasso refreshes itself when recast on the same unit. However the aghs damage does not get refreshed and stops based on the first cast.  **Current behavior:** Recasting lasso on the same target doesn't refresh the damage.  **Expected behavior:** The damage should refreshed on recast as well.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRWiXz-YudM)  ---  #9. Flamebreak is always off-set by 25 range based on Bat's position  Flamebreak does not exactly hit the area you target. Instead it's off set by a small amount. That small amount is big enough to fit an entire hero in between though.  **Current behavior:** Flamebreak is off set by 25 range forwards hitting 25 range further but missing 25 range between bat and the target area.  **Expected behavior:** Flamebreak's explosion should be perfectly centered on the targeted point.  If this is difficult to understand [this image should explain it well enough] (http://i.imgur.com/1yRow6x.png).  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYUHFXpBaOQ)  ---  #10. Recasting Flamebreak causes previous cast to explode at the wrong place  When recasting Flamebreak before the first cast finishes the new cast interferes with the first cast and messes it up.  **Current behavior:** Recasting Flamebreak makes the previous cast explode where the new projectile is instead of where it was targeted.  **Expected behavior:** Each cast should be completely independent and not mess up the locations of the previous casts.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmno5Uy9n-c)  ---  #11. Sticky Napalm not working for Bat when first stack wasn't placed by him  Sticky Napalm only works for whoever put the first stack on a target.  **Current behavior:** When a Batrider Morph Hybrid places the first Sticky Napalm stack Batrider cannot trigger Sticky Napalm regardless of how many stacks he adds to the target.  **Expected behavior:** Every hero who contributed to the stack should be able to trigger it. Alternatively the Sticky Napalm debuff should update to the latest caster.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV40r2qIPEc)  ---  #12. Flaming Lasso can be cast on Roshan without affecting him  Roshan is immune to any form of forced movement so Flaming Lasso does nothing against him.  **Current behavior:** Flaming Lasso can target Roshan doing nothing wasting mana and cooldown.  **Expected behavior:** Flaming Lasso cannot target Roshan.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhmtpwawAJ0)  ---  #13. Multiple lassoes from different sources on the same target behave badly  Flaming Lasso doesn't update when second hero casts lasso on an already lassoed unit. What it does is it disarms the new caster and refreshes the already existing lasso. The target is still bound to the first caster. Meanwhile the disarm on the first caster expires normally and isn't refreshed. So what we have is a unit still lassoed to the first caster the first caster no longer disarm and the second caster disarmed.  **Expected behavior:** Multiple options:  * The lasso should update to the new caster so that the target is now bound to the new caster instead. * The new caster should not be disarmed but the first caster should get the disarm on them refreshed. The unit stays bound to the first caster still.  In the video you can see how this scenario is possible in a regular game. It requires Anti-Mage with Scepter and Rubick.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmm-r2jG1gM)  ---  #14. Rubick instantly loses Firefly's flying vision upon losing the spell  When Rubick has Firefly active he gains the flying vision normally. But as soon as he loses the spell he also loses the flying vision. All other aspects of the cast still work normally.  **Current behavior:** On spell loss the active Firefly instance still works normally *except* for the flying vision which gets lost. If you re-steal the spell while the instance still runs you regain the flying vision.  **Expected behavior:** The flying vision should be bound to the buff/modifier not to the ability itself. Just like how all other aspects of the effect are bound to the modifier.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctpqk_ASvt8)  ---  #15. Firefly does not grant flying vision to heroes other than Batrider  Firefly itself seems to not provide flying vision. It's more like an ""activator"" of flying vision. Batrider and Rubick are the only heroes capable of having flying vision so the activator only works here. Any other hero does not gain flying vision with Firefly  **Current behavior:** Firefly's flying vision only works for Batrider and Rubick.  **Expected behavior:** Its flying vision should work for whoever casts the spell and stay until the buff disappears.

Dire offlane creeps split up at the tier 1 tower. Can we give this some attention so it gets fixed?,self.DotA2,I guess you call this a bug. It's been happening since 7.02 and still isn't fixed. When you're trying to block as a Dire offlaner the creeps will want to split up when they get to the tier 1 tower. 1-2 creeps will want to go left of the tower and the rest want to go to the right of it. So you can't block the wave from that point on.  I know people have posted about this here but I haven't seen those thread get too much attention or get to the front page of the sub. We've got the Kiev Major coming up shortly and this does affect things in a small way. Let's see if we can highlight this issue so it can get fixed soon!,bug

Significant Time Dilation bug in NaVi vs VG.R,self.DotA2,EDIT: This is game 1 of the grand finals.  At approximately 53:56 game time VG.R were pushing mid highground when YANG on Beastmaster (with a Refresher) has around 15 secs until Primal Roar comes off cooldown. Void hits him with Time Dilation bringing and freezing the roar cd to 27 secs.  Beastmaster refreshes roars Dendi (his roar goes on the ~70s cooldown as a result). When Time Dilation expires the roar magically comes back to the 15 sec cooldown it had before being affected by Time Dilation effectively cutting the roar cooldown by ~55 secs.

Auras don't automatically prioritize the highest level source when multiple are nearby  When there are multiple sources of the same aura nearby the game does not automatically prioritize the highest level of them.  For example if an allied Beastmaster with level 1 aura picks up an illusion rune then sends the illusion to an ally and then levels up his aura to 2 and then moves to the ally as well. The ally will still be affected by the level 1 aura since the illusion was there first. The stronger level 2 aura of Beastmaster is ignored. Even worse even after the illusion died the aura buff will stay on level 1. In order for the ally to be affected by the level 2 aura they first have to fully lose the buff and then re-gain it.  This is even worse for heroes with global auras. Here is a scenario that can cause CM's aura to not update for some allies until they actually die.  **Repro:**  1. Allied CM has level 1 Arcane Aura you are affected by it 2. Allied CM picks up an illusion rune 3. Allied CM dies the aura buff is now kept up by the illusions 4. While dead CM levels up aura to level 2 5. Before the illusions expire CM respawns 6. The illusions expire and disappear  **Result:** Once CM respawns and the illusions die afterwards you still are affected by the level 1 buff. The buff will not update to level 2 even though CM's aura is on level 2.  **Expected:** Auras should *immediately* prioritize the stronger aura. If 2 units with the same aura get close to you and one of them is on a higher level the higher level should instantly override the lower level aura.   [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvwPHUJ5Hng)  ---  #2. Scepter upgraded Freezing Field applies level 0 Frostbites  Freezing Field's Scepter upgrade still applies Frostbite's mini-stun after 2.5 seconds even if there aren't any points placed into Frostbite.  Even funnier when choosing the +1.5s Frostbite duration talent it applies a 1.5s duration Frostbite together with the mini-stun. Since Frostbite is on level 0 this mini-frostbite deals no damage.  **Repro:**  1. Level up Freezing Field (keep Frostbite at 0) 2. Purchase Aghanim's Scepter 3. (optional) choose the +1.5s Frostbite talent 4. Cast Freezing Field with an enemy in range and wait 2.5 seconds. 5. (optional) Have the enemy cast a disruptable spell  **Result:** After 2.5 seconds Freezing Field mini-stuns the enemy interrupting them. If the +1.5s talent is chosen a 1.5s Frostbite is applied which deals no damage.  **Expected:** Since Frostbite is not leveled it should not be applied at all. A spell not learned should not be castable under any condition.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhdcyMV2wIY)  ---  #3. Scepter upgraded Freezing Field Frostbites use hero duration on creeps  The Frostbites applied by Freezing Field always use the hero duration despite the Frostbite spell having a creep duration for non-ancient creeps.  **Repro:**  1. Have 2 tanky non-ancient creeps nearby 2. Cast Frostbite on one of them 3. Immediately start channeling Freezing Field so that only the other creep gets hit 4. Cancel Freezing Field as soon as the 2nd creep gets frostbitten  **Result:** The frostbite applied by Freezing Field expires first despite it being applied at least ~3 seconds after the manually cast Frostbite. Freezing Field used the hero duration on the creep.  **Expected:** Freezing Field should use the creep duration (10 seconds 11.5 with talent) on non-ancient creeps just like how a manually cast Frostbite does.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjOe4DqQXg)  ---  #4. Freezing Field does 99 explosions instead of 100  This one was fixed once before already (quite some time ago) but got broken again.  Freezing Field is supposed to do 100 icy explosions. It currently does 99. [Even the ability description says 100 explosions] (https://i.imgur.com/aFf6F6C.png).  10s duration divided by 0.1s interval is 100 shards.  **Repro:**  1. Cast Freezing Field and count the shards (tip: Use host_timescale)  **Result:** 99 explosions are spawned.  **Expected:** 100 explosions should be spawned.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8gpfDSvEaM)  --- --- --- ## Suggestions ---  #1. Bring some consistency in how interrupting root abilities interrupt enemies   There are 16 rooting abilities in Dota 2 from which 6 interrupt their targets.  These 6 use 3 different methods of interrupting.  1. Searing Chains Nature's Guise Overgrowth Entangling Claws: These force a stop command on the unit (as if they pressed S to stop). 2. Ensnare (Naga Siren) and Ensnare (Dark Troll Summoner): These force only the channeling to stop without affecting anything else. 3. Frostbite: Technically Frostbite's root does not interrupt at all. Instead the ability applies the stun modifier.   So this is how they behave against certain orders.  * Group 1: Channeling spells completely interrupted any other order completely canceled shift-queues cleared. * Group 2: Only channeling interrupted but hero continues with channeling animation (which delays shift-queued orders). Does not interfere with any of the unit's actions. * Group 3: Channeling spells completely interrupted any other order interrupted but unit automatically restarts them since stuns do not clear unit orders.   This is some unnecessary inconsistency. It would be better if all interrupting roots would do it in the same way. In my opinion the 1st option is the most straight forward and most clean while the 3rd option is the worst. The second option would be fine too but it needs that one bug fixed where the channel animation does not get canceled.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bpSTjmYY6c)  ---  #2. Make Freezing Field use a slow aura instead of spamming a slow debuff   Currently Freezing Field simply spams its slow debuff in 0.1 second intervals on everyone within the slow radius.  Since the slow is centered on CM and independent from the icy explosions it would make more sense to use an aura here instead. It would effectively make no difference but make it look cleaner.  Differences this change would make  1. Status debuff no longer constantly flashes due to periodic refreshing of the modifier 2. It can no longer be dispelled (dispelling it currently is pointless anyway since it gets re-applied very quickly) 3. Status resistance would reduce slow value instead of slow duration (duration reduction is pointless for the same reason as above) 4. Slow applies instantly on each server tick instead of every 0.1 seconds.  Everything else would stay the exact same  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT8A8SAoG9g)  Or alternatively make the icy explosions apply the slow instead would make more sense logic-wise. But this would be quite the nerf for the ability.   --- --- --- ## Tooltip stuff ---  **Crystal Nova:**  * Added new ALT note about the 900 radius 6 seconds ground vision  **Frostbite:**  * Reworded description to use proper terms (root&disarm) * Fixed description saying it lasts longer on creeps on level 6 or lower (level of creep doesn't matter) * Reworded ALT note about disabling blinks * Added new ALT note about the True Sight * Added new ALT note about the interrupting * Removed total damage values from traits (since they can't be made to consider talent bonuses) * Fixed the duration talent bonus not being added to the creep duration in the description  **Arcane Aura:**  * Slightly reworded description to fit general style more * Removed second note which is now completely irrelevant since the regen mechanic changes * Slightly adapted the first note for the same reason * Added note to the manacost/manaloss reduction talent to make it clear that it is added to Arcane Aura and is not a separate aura  **Freezing Field:**  * Reworded description to be more accurate regarding how the slow is applied * Added explosion spawn radius to traits * Added Scepter Frostbite delay to the traits  [Image comparing the changes to the current tooltips] (https://i.imgur.com/9baA4BY.jpg)  [dota_english and npc_abilities changes can be found here] (https://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=286548)  ---,bug

Bot matches are completely ruined.,self.DotA2,"So I sometimes play a bot match or two for the very relaxing environment (no flaming each other except Morty Bot I always flame Morty Bot).  There are several things that are broken after 7.00:  * Bots get stuck before the horn. When playing Radiant bots get stuck between the Large camp and Medium camp in the jungle near the mid lane.  * Bots can get stuck trying to place a ward. I'm assuming that they check for valid ward position and that there's not already a ward there. Some ward locations seems to return errors which makes the bot stuck for instance the ward spot behind ""old Roshan"" near the Dire secret shop.  * Bots do not understand Monkey King (at all). If they see him jump onto a tree they will swarm to that position and stand right next to that tree forever or until they see Monkey King somewhere else.  * Bots do not understand Tinker March of the Machines (this is not a new bug they didn't understand it before 7.00 either). Even unfair bots do not respond to standing inside march until their health reaches a threshold where they start running back towards base. *There are probably several heroes that can be added to the ""bots do not understand this hero's ability""-list.* * Bots start ""Roaming to gank X"" almost always when X is below a certain health threshold and thus run way out of position to kill that enemy.  * Bots do not understand bounty runes and will only pick them up if they ""stumble across it"" (which is almost never).  * Bots never use Shrines. Ever. (At least after the 20-30 hours I've spent playing with bots).  * Bots do not understand that the ""real rune"" can only spawn in one location and can get stuck trying to pick up a rune that is not there. If they for instance run top at 3:58 to get the rune at 4:00 and the rune spawns at the other location the bot will usually stand around waiting (because it receives a ""negative"" on the ""bottle filled"" check I assume).  * ~~Before the patch bots always upgraded the courier at 3:00 (or approximately around that timing)~~ (EDIT: I realize I was wrong here but it's still the same bug now) . Now they don't do it.  * More courier bugs: The bots can end up using the courier to ""stand around"". I noticed a bot playing Pudge having the courier standing around him for no reason and even proceeded to grab the courier to stand by him again for no reason when I was using it.  * Even more courier bugs: Bots use the courier for every small item around 1-2 minutes into the game which they didn't do before the 7.00 patch. In a way this resembles the life of a mid-laner in a real match as well so not sure if this is a bug or ""intended feature"". * Bots don't understand backpacks and will keep late game items in the backpack rather than switch out for other items.  * Bots don't understand illusions and will use preventive items if approached by them.  * Bots try to build old recipes for items (such as drum of endurance). * Bots do not skill talent tree * If a bot has a full inventory and wants to pick up an item which cannot be placed in backpack (Aegis Rapier Gem) they will just stand there looking longingly at the item until you kill them or snatch the item. * If you buy a courier in the picking phase your team will end up with (at least) two (non-functional) couriers.  I'm sure there are several more bugs that I haven't remembered from the top of my head. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong or add to the list (I can keep updating if there are others who are playing versus bots from now and then and have more bugs to this list).   Edit: Formatting  Edit2: Some additional bullet points. Also want to mention to sceptics: Yes I agree that there are pressing matters to focus on in the ""actual game"" but there are a bunch of us who enjoy bot matches from time to time and it is also a great way for new players to try the game without ""ruining games in pubs"".   Edit3: Realized one bullet point needed strikethrough since several people pointed out it was a bug before 7.00 as well. Bug is still there so it still stands as a bug on the list. Added a bullet point. ",bug
daily reminder that dire offlane creep path needs a fix,self.DotA2,im almost always offlane and need this fixed. dire offlane creep path is broken you cant block creeps properly anymore since defense of the league of storm patch the creeps go completely crazy 9 out of 10 times once they reach t1 tower and blocking is pretty much impossible. it works on radiant just fine so it gives them a pretty huge advantage on offlane and may or may not be another tiny %wr for radiant. danke herr eidechse,bug

DotA 2,self.DotA2,I just want to play it    ,complaint
Disqualified from TI6 open qualifiers due to error by the coordinators of the event faceit.com,self.DotA2,Extremely frustrated with faceit.com (website coordinating the open qualifiers for TI6)  tl;dr My team was disqualified from the open qualifiers of TI6 because the admins started our second game while we were still in our first and wouldn't allow us back into the first round of the open qualifiers.  My team (MFG__) competed in the The International 2016 open qualifier Americas #1.  In the lobby for our first match the opposing team failed to join in time to play the match and it was therefore ended.  However our team was not awarded the win.  After contacting the admins *FACEIT Sue* joined our lobby and restarted the match.  So we played our match and won.  However after our match was complete we found out on faceit they started our second match while we were still playing the first one.  Since we were in the middle of our first game we couldn't join the lobby for the second one and the admins disqualified us allowing the other team to advance.  We voiced our complaints with *FACEIT Sue* who told us we were out of luck and eliminated from the tournament.  After continuing to argue our case she redirected us to *FACEIT_Mikey* to hear our concerns.  But the only way to talk with someone directly through their website is the friend them.  I have friended *FACEIT_Mikey* but as of this time he has not accepted.  Inside the match rooms the conversations between my team and the admin can be viewed Me: Uctok Teammate: foreverdaed  First match room: [https://www.faceit.com/en/dota2/room/b1225f4c-05e0-4e49-bd73-a41989c5e845](https://www.faceit.com/en/dota2/room/b1225f4c-05e0-4e49-bd73-a41989c5e845)  Second match room: [https://www.faceit.com/en/dota2/room/51d3a832-dbdc-4f7e-9d57-c422badbb6f5](https://www.faceit.com/en/dota2/room/51d3a832-dbdc-4f7e-9d57-c422badbb6f5)   Yes we could still participate in the second round of open qualifiers but my team arranged their schedules to play at this time and are unavailable for the second round of qualifiers    **Update:** foreverdaed was able to contact [/u/Faceit_Mikey](https://www.reddit.com/u/Faceit_Mikey) through faceit's chat client today.  I can't link to that chat window but if you believe me here's their conversation: [http://textuploader.com/53hk5](http://textuploader.com/53hk5)  While he apologizes that this happened to us he defends and reiterates it wasn't there fault.  From his and [kidovate's excellent response](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4p8qf5/disqualified_from_ti6_open_qualifiers_due_to/d4j28bt) I believe they are in part true - why did Valve choose to still do their patching during what is likely the busiest days and busiest times they will have all year?  And why did they not coordinate their patch/API changes with Faceit who Valve must have known would surely be impacted by it?  I hope Faceit Valve or both take the next step and admit this ruined the open qualifiers not just for my team but reading through these comments and Faceit_Mickey's comments other teams as well.  I hope they try to do something to compensate or show their sincerity.  Yes faceit is working on improving their system so this type of scenario doesn't happen again but that doesn't fix the fact that my team was unfairly left out of fully participating and enjoying TI6.,complaint
Bring 2GD back,self.DotA2,"Bring your support here guys we all know that Valve keeps an eye out on reddit.   The return of James was a great addition to the first Shanghai Major even when it was going to shit with the stream cuts audio problems and so forth. Bring him back he did a great job even with so much downtime.    UPDATE 1: [@follow2GD](https://twitter.com/follow2GD/status/703133163590017024?lang=en)  2016-02-26 08:23 UTC  > Regarding the Reddit thread comments it was valves decision. before the event I was told to be myself. :(  UPDATE 2: [@follow2GD](https://twitter.com/follow2GD/status/703247410181464064?lang=en)  2016-02-26 16:00 UTC  >Going to sleep on it (statement). It's a very very odd situation. more than meets the eye you could say.  For users from /r/all:  James ""2GD"" Harding is a dota 2(ARTS video game) panel host who mediates a panel of dota 2 experts in discussing the games that have happened/ will happen soon as well as the teams who will be playing the games. Think soccer round-table host talking about the soccer match before and after.   He's known for being unconventionally entertaining (with British banter swearing etc.) and Valve has told James [to ""be himself"" for the event](https://twitter.com/follow2GD/status/703133163590017024?lang=en).   The working theory right now is that he apparently stepped on too many toes extending one of his segments for too long and got released as a result. There has been no official statement regarding the situation yet but the reality is that James is no longer hosting the panel having been replaced by Jorien ""Sheever"" van der Heijden the other host at the event.  There's more backlash as a result of very vocal negative community feedback about the tournament's production which has resulted in the broadcast stream cutting twice today audio issues as well as timing issues. This is evident in the stream over at www.twitch.tv/dotamajor which is at 8:42 SGT still spamming ""Bring back James"" memes.   ",complaint
"Valve this ""Not tradeable Not marketable Not giftable"" trend has GOT to stop.",self.DotA2,"Edit: Whoa reddit gold thanks! Edit 2: front page of /r/all ?! reddit gold x8 ?! PogChamp  I just hope the post somehow helps...  ~~~~  &nbsp;  I posted this in the patch notes but a bunch of people commented asking me to re-post it as a thread.  &nbsp;  ~~~~  I just spent $10 on a compendium and I can't even GIFT the courier etc to a friend.  &nbsp;  Looking at Valve's policy:  &nbsp;  2013  - All items: Tradeable/Marketable immediately  &nbsp;  Like a frog in a frying pan (pun not intended) one by one they have slowly turned into:  2015  - Sets I purchase: Not tradable or marketable for 3 months  - Compendiums I purchase: Not tradable marketable or giftable for 1 week  - Items I work for in-game: Not tradeable or marketable EVER  - Items from the TI5 compendium I purchased: Not tradeable or marketable for 3 months but giftable  - Half of the items from the Fall 2015 compendium I purchased: Not tradeable marketable or giftable for 3 months  - The other half of the items from the Fall 2015 compendium I purchased: Not tradeable marketable or giftable EVER   &nbsp;  I've been in the Valve ecosystem and spent thousands as a paying customer since 2007. I *hate* sounding entitled but when I'm paying I do feel entitled to *own* the items I pay for and I think people who work for their items should have a sense of ownership of them too.  &nbsp;  At this point we're penalized far more by the ""anti-abuse safeguards"" than the side-effects that abuse has on devaluing our items etc. [Kotaku had a great post today](http://steamed.kotaku.com/steam-customer-service-is-still-terrible-1734354928) about Steam Support still not responding for months to legit customer account issues so these lockdowns don't seem to have fixed that.  &nbsp;  I don't care if my items aren't ""worth"" much due to abuse-related inflation or about people who are scammed by someone promising something in return for an item or whether a handful of workshop artists can make a living off selling item sets by making the hundreds of thousands of paying customers deal with these restrictions (now THAT is entitled) -- seriously half the people here are complaining about item set overload anyways.  &nbsp;  But I do care about being able to legitimately trade/sell/share/gift like I can when I own something in real life. Heck I play with IRL dota friends including one where I heh *forcefully loaned* a Na'Vi flag to the wall of his office for TI5... ;) -- why can't I interact with my in-game items the same way?  &nbsp;  It's not even just the heavily-paying dota addicts -- I'm an admin for an amature league and regularly get new people asking me about dota. Quite a few times people have asked me why their Dota Battle Point level has to be a certain level (still not even documented by the wiki because no one knows what the algorithm is) before they can start trading items even though they've been paying customers on steam for *years*. Other people weren't able to give their friend a compendium before TI (or missed things like event predictions) because of the 1-week no-gift restriction.   &nbsp;  Many have proposed roughly the same thing and something like it would make a lot of sense.   1) Active customers who have bought stuff on steam had security enabled and haven't had any account problems in the last year: No restrictions.  This works around  - Credit card thieves who make brand new steam accounts  - Dead/unused accounts being stolen  - At-risk acounts  - Repeat offenders  2) New accounts: All items not marketable/tradeable but giftable for 1 week (maybe disallow gifting or re-gifting if the credit card hasn't been registered for a week and gray market scams are still a killer thing)   This supports  - Newbies who want to buy a gift for someone or buy a steam gift to play with a friend -- they weren't going to trade those soon anyways.  - Plenty of time for Valve to auto-revoke gifts received that were fraudulently purchased.  3) Repeat offenders etc: Total lockdown or whatever  &nbsp;  This probably isn't the final solution and it's certainly open to abuse but it's closer to where the mentality should be.  &nbsp;  I think paying customers need to make this issue more visible to Valve.",complaint

Yo Valve FYI the way you have the store setup... You're breaking the law and liable for criminal charges and up to $600000 in fines per infraction.,self.DotA2,"# **[Update Two (31 March 2016): We DIDNT do it it Reddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4cnhs8/im_sorry_this_has_to_be_brought_up_again_but_we/)**  After reviewing the changes made its clear they have only modified the store page itself.  I take responsibility for this as I never explicitly insisted that the hero pages be fixed too.  [If you do the same thing from the hero page you can be mislead into buying a treasure rather than a set.](https://imgur.com/ENfGyyM)  # DotA players: 0 - Valve: 1  # Valve released an update but did a half ass job.  ---   If you were to browse the DotA2 Store and look to buy (for example) ""Daemonfell Flame"" for LC the store lists the price as $3.69 (New Zealand).  This is actually the cost of Winter Treasure IV with a snowballs chance in hell of actually getting the set you're after.  This amounts to a breach of New Zealand's Fair Trading Act (false or misleading) and has criminal liability as well as other shit.  I know I've just listed New Zealand here.  But I know that the same rules apply in most countries. Definitely England Canada and Australia.  I just don't know what the penalty is for those guys (likely similar).  TLDR:  You're breaking the law Valve   Edit: For all the people downvoting this:  The requirement to fall afoul of the Act is that the representation being made is ""likely or possibly"" misleading.  There is no requirement that the vendor *intends* to deceive nor is it necessary for the customer to not be mislead or deceived.  Edit 2:  Looks like for the same offence in Australia it could be ""up to $1.1 million"" (I haven't looked into this specific punishment 100%)  # [In summing up...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gls09kO-8DE)",complaint
Crowd STFU,self.DotA2,"That is all.  Edit: For the latecomers and /r/all:  We're currently spectating The International 2016 a massive Dota2 tournament organized by Valve.

My team lost the finals of Starladder without even playing it.

All evidence is provided.,self.DotA2,Our name is CasGam (Casual Gamers).   * Here is our interaction with admins where you can clearly see we were promptly ready after our previous game. We finished our games and followed the procedure (As is documented in the link) http://dota2.starladder.tv/forum/categories/719/67078  * This is the tournament is question as you can see the finals were forfeited. We still have not recieved word as to why.  http://dota2.starladder.tv/tournament/8892  * Most of our games were casted by an official caster who validated that we did not do anything badly mannered in our games.   * As a rather new team we were very happy to be able to play in the finals. It sucks to be let down that hard and not even be given a reason from the admins as to why. Furthermore the fact that we are the ones being punished for trying to contact the admins as the others were not answering.  * We were told by an admin that the finals could not be decided by the decision of the admins yet it was.  * The opposing team claims to have contacted us but never did.   * What do you think we should do about this?

The game Roshpit Champions uses **a lot** of stolen assets and is despite all of that now being monetized.     The developers took icons art and models from other artists and developers simply implemented them in the game and did not even credit those (not to mention that they are monetizing work that they have no rights to).  As far as the legal agreement goes everyone who uploads anything to the workshop agrees to:  > D. Representations and Warranties  > ""You represent and warrant to us that you have sufficient rights in all User Generated Content to grant Valve and other affected parties the licenses described under A. and B. above or in any license terms specific to the applicable Workshop-Enabled App or Workshop page.

Yet apparently that did not matter here at all. Here are a few examples of the things they have stolen:    [adamantine_samurai_helmet](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/roshpitchampions/images/6/60/Adamantine_Samurai_Helmet.png) taken from the loading screen of the FrozenYoroi Warrior set (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=413240800). Item has NOT been approved in the workshop thus not property of Valve. Artist has not been credited whatsoever.   [admirals_boot](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/roshpitchampions/images/1/1a/Admiral%27s_Boots.png) taken from a Kunkka set called Resolute Seafarer (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=393577229). Same applies as before    Arcanys Slippers cropped from the alchemist's boots from the set Alchemist's unbeaten willpower (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=505427981) Same applies as before    armor_of_secret_temple taken from Blossoms Mystical Regalia (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=374007647)     avalanche_plate taken from The Perennial Giant (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=454511369)   blinded_glint_of_onu taken from Ima and Mirai  masks for Juggernaut (https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=322410185)    brazen_kabuto_of_the_desert_realm taken from the Firebirds Awakening set (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=449352855)    centaur_horns taken from the Horned Barbarian Set (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=148146035)    [crusader_boots](http://puu.sh/nIlg6/534fb94c2f.png) taken from Darion and Alexandros Morgaine's boots from **World of Warcraft (Blizzard Entertainment)**   cytopian_laser_glove taken from the fulminous punisher set for Razor (https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=337596845)    dark_arts_vestments taken from the Theasures of Dark Rift   death_whisper_helm taken from Haze Whisperer (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=471001280)    doomplate taken from Flames of Tarrasque a Doom Set for Mag (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=273325094)    dragon_ceremony_vestments taken from Lord of the storm - SET (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=409276539)    emerald_douli taken from Crystal hat of eternity (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=209424275)    energizing_quest_gear taken from Guardian of the Manta Style Set (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631285990)    featherwhite_armor taken from Featherwhite Regalia set (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=425192619)      All of these assets and far more are just a few examples that were taken from loading screens and item previews. I did not bother linking every icon you can look it up yourself on their wiki or in the game. They copypasted and cropped what they needed from fanart and sets and used it. At least one of them was taken from World of Warcraft which is even worse. I didn't check every single icon only a third of them but I bet almost all art assets follow the same pattern. If the set has not been implemented in the store then the art still belongs to their respective artist and artists do not automatically give up their rights.     The models of the [house/s](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/353899007301408244/11C9A3F3D8AFAFCD8901D0420DB398E4D9BF3A08) they use in the starter area was taken from Curse of River's End. Obviously the author wasn't credited either and is not getting anything from the revenue. I would like to know where the other models are coming from they look completely out of place and pasted from another game.      I also wonder where they got the music from. There is no one credited for that. Could be royalty-free music or stolen as well. Even then I believe you still have to credit royalty-free music.    I obviously can't and don't want to check every single asset they stole because the 50+ are more than enough to raise the question: Is this really acceptable? It's already pretty damn shady when someone steals from another developer and uses it in his 'hobby-mod' but when things get ACTUALLY monetized on the workshop that are full with rip-offs then I do question Valve's integrity there. No one cared about checking the legitimacy of the game and just put it on the workshop so they can start reaping money. Not even gonna talk about the P2W pass or the fact that the game was completely unplayable right after it got the pass coincides with all of that talk in the interview about high quality standards and professionalism.    A horrible example to start support for this scene. I can understand if one or two things got overlooked or are an honest mistake but this is certainly no mistake and Valve did not bother to ask themselves where it came from. This isn't the first time this happens with Valve either. Valve had multiple cases across their games where UGC turned out to be completely stolen (I think it was the mace for Void in Dota haven't played back then so correct me if I'm wrong).     Is this really something Valve wants to encourage? Ripping off from all kinds of people put it in the game and get paid and rewarded? I doubt developers will like that kind of workshop or the artists that they stole from. Pretty funny to see Valve talking about establishing a future for the scene and how they took DMCA very seriously and then they completely ignore all of it.  *""a certain level of professionalism should be expected from custom game creators offering premium passes. I wouldn't like to see custom games drop to the level of money-grab mobile games. I have high standards for myself and Roshpit Champions and I would appreciate if peer games did as well.""* -  ChalkyBrush  **Edit:** Since I was downvoted asking for a source here a clarification courtesy of /u/Endritv: [According to Valve](http://i.imgur.com/QuCAIWz.png) you DO keep the rights to your IP when you upload something so this is **not** property of Valve and [still belongs to the artist](http://i.imgur.com/ZUS00vt.png) making this still theft.",complaint

Hello ESL I'm cancelling my trip to Katowice,self.DotA2,"I bought tickets to the Arena right on the first day travel tickets booked a good hotel in downtown wanted to spend some money over there. Merch Polish food visiting local stuff with my wife having some kurwa good Dota experience.  But thanks to your arrogant bitchy behaviour you can fuck off. I'm cancelling this whole trip. As you will keep the money I paid for the tickets you can buy some fake fb viewers to reach the 10k dream.  Viewing on facebook? First I didn't think there would be problem for me as I'm on FB. Didn't even think there would be any issue I mean you are ESL this is what you do for living right? You are a service provider an organizer you know what we the players need.  I tried to watch your stream on fb. It's shit. S H I T. Not the casters it's the quality of the stream with all the retarded emojis delays kales.

Valve this custom game contest is a bad joke,self.DotA2,As we all know Valve gave modders this awesome opportunity to show themselves and earn some money with the brand new custom game contest.  And all was good and everyone was happy in the modderland until Valve decided that we are having too much fun with it and everything is just too bright and sweet.  On release of 7.07 the modding tools were unavailable for around 24 hours due to Valve seemingly forgetting to push a file into the release build. Now it might have been more complicated than that shit happens I get it. They even responded to an email detailing the bug and told us the fix was rolling out soon. Good guy Valve right? Not really though. The update brought many breaking changes including the rework of the whole attribute system changing how mana and health regen works and all that jazz. Obviously a lot of existing games depended heavily on how stats worked and their creators had to stop working on their contest entries and go and fix their games. But this isn't even the main issue.  The main issue is **COMMUNICATION**. I'll just list the things we were **NOT** communicated about in no particular order:  1. The removal of old regen-related functions from the API. Just like that. Not deprecated straight up removed. Used them? Deal with it. 2. The complete turnaround of how herolist.txt (a file used to restrict the list of picked heroes in a custom game) worked. An addition of an activelist.txt which you had to go and figure out. Many games depended on it. 3. Changing the return type of GetBehavior function. Used by many broke a lot. Then they changed it back. 4. The change of RespawnHero signature. Just like that no fallback method. Just removed an argument. Stupid probably unnecessary and broke many games for a small amount of time. That time however adds up. 5. The model editor situation. An absolutely crucial tool in the modder's arsenal used to look up model animations now silently crashes when you try to open any model which doesn't have a source file. And we don't have source files for any of the Valve models. I guess it's not a crucial bug since it's not broken for Valve themselves right? I sent a complete bug description with a crash dump the day it broke Nov 2. Yet to see a fix (how many updates have there been in those days? 15? 20?) or hear a response. There are only so many days left until the deadline. 6. None of the other numerous API additions and changes. How hard it is to go through your own commits and compile a list of things you worked on?  You would think the update was a long con thing and it just so happened to align with the contest too bad shit happens. You would think they would just clean up after it and stop breaking things. Jokes on you.  Yesterday they introduced a breaking change which messes up ability button keys in a lot of custom games and which I'm yet to figure out. Because figuring that out and fixing that takes time. Which I have to do or my already limping game will just die. And I just built a list of things I need to do for my contest entry this week because it's practically the last week you can put in serious work since you need at least a week for public testing. Less than 2 weeks remaining how much more of that bullcrap are we going to withstand?  Shame on you Valve. You have neglected us for a year now and now you are breaking our hearts. We all thought you were [UGC oriented](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zkfmv/wearea_videogame_developer_aua/cfufdfl/). [The bot scripts forum](https://dev.dota2.com/forumdisplay.php?f=497) clearly shows that communication with developers is possible meanwhile the custom games forum is a complete wasteland.  EDIT: Just wanted to point out that we collaborated as a community and created a separate bug/requests tracker on github. We were very happy when Valve responded to issues there. Once. That never happened again. And on topic of API updates: again we as a community created VAC-unsafe tools which hook up into the dota2 binary and dump the changes in the API. Risky heavy unstable unreliable only for server code. Still if we can do it from the outside automatically why can't Valve? Oh yeah and clientside UI documentation dump has been broken for like 6 months now.  EDIT2: For everyone saying that they can't account for custom games when they are changing their code and that things will always break: read the post more carefully. The breakage is inevitable as long as the game is evolving. No need to compare with Wc3 which had patches once per 3-4 months or rarer. The IMPORTANT thing there is communicating the changes before they happen communicating that an important bug is getting worked on or is not getting worked on.,complaint

Valve it's been over 250 days since the last hero was released.,self.DotA2,**As of today (Nov. 11 - 2015) it's been 273 days since the last hero (Winter Wyvern) was released (back on Feb. 11 - 2015).**  To put that into perspective:  The distance between Winter Wyvern and Oracle (The previous hero) is **91 Days**.  And the distance between Oracle and Techies: **77 Days**.  -------------------- The longest time between hero releases *was* **218 days** which is the days between the release of Techies and New Bloom but that was 2 heroes in the same day (Terrorblade &amp; Phoenix: Jan. 29 - 2014).  Legion commander was released only **48 days** before New Bloom.  And both Ember Spirit &amp; Earth Spirit were released **27 Days** before Legion Commander.

People who are AFK during ranked pick phase should just get an abandon instead of getting a random hero,self.DotA2,I just lost 2 games in a row because of that 1 guy who just alt tabs the entire pick phase and we obviously lost because the guy has no idea how to play his hero Its pretty much the same thing as playing 4v5 from the start of the game   lets say the guy knows how to play 20 heroes out of 112 so 92/112 times  its gonna be like that and I personally think that should be enough of a reason to give out abandons  ,complaint

Truth about IG.,self.DotA2,(Posting for Ana since his post was removed)  Hi guys  Everything you're about to read is the truth and even though it probably won't help me I hope others learn from my mistake.I never wanted to post or bring this drama to the public but I have exhausted all possible channels of communication and I am at my wits end.   I guess most of you don't know me since I'm not a top player so I'll give a brief intro to my background. I'm a 16 year old Australian born Chinese/Viet mix who left the final year of high school to try play dota2 professionally and my family isn't exactly well off so my success in dota is very important. My friend & manager Tian (CEO of gogosu.com a Chinese dota2 coaching platform) helped me piece my thoughts and write this post.   Proof its me.  http://imgur.com/a/E5WvS  Tian has been my friend even before I went to China we used to play Aus pubs together a lot and when he understood my situation he recommended me to try pro dota2 for a year. With the help of Tian I left for China on 17th of Jan and stayed with hes family until end of March during this period Tian used his connections in China and had vouched for me to trial at different clubs EHOME.K VG.R and IG. I was very new to pro dota and seriously sucked so I was beyond ecstatic that IG were interested in offering me a position.  Tian helped me read and alter a thick contract between IG ACE and myself. Initially the contract was heavily favored toward IG and left very little protection to myself. IG could let go of me as they wished didn't guarantee me prize money split couldn't guarantee me play time and was a two year long contract. The offer was for me to play as IGV's main player but that Ferrari430 may come back at some point and at that point I could either switch to the other IG roster or play as sub.  Because of this Tian made multiple adjustments to the proposed contract including but not limited to the following  * I would have equal prize money with all 5 players in non valve events whether I was a main player or sub * I would have equal prize money with 4 players (BBK XXS QD Rong but excluding Ferrari430) in Valve events * The contract would only last 1 year instead of 2 * That I would be guaranteed some play time in scrims and minor tournaments * That I would be provided a teacher for Chinese and Math That all my travel costs to renew my Chinese visa would be paid for  After many iterations back and forth IG finally agreed to these changes however when we went to sign none of the agreed upon changes made it into the final contract. I immediately contacted Zhili IG's COO and he guaranteed that it was a clerical mistake and that everything IG promised will hold even though the contract had been changed. He said that it would be too late to reprint and to trust his word on it. My mother in Australia signed the contract for me as I am still underage.  Fast forward a few weeks Ferrari430 was suddenly back and IGV renamed to IG and IG renamed to IGV I was told I could play mid for IGV (Paparazzi's stack) or sub for Ferrari430. It was a very tough decision but I chose to stay with IG because IG promised me that even though I was a sub I would still get equal share of prize money and IG also promised that it would be the final year for Ferrari430 and that he was definitely retiring after TI regardless of result. Had I known what was about to happen to me I would have never chose to be benched for 4 months as a sub.   After returning to the team Ferrari430 played very well in the NEA online qualifiers and helped IG secure LAN final in Beijing and then abruptly left the team. I was subbed in last minute and played only in the LAN finals but luckily we were able to secure the victory over Newbee.  Fast forward a few months and a lot has happened or should I say not happened. Ferrari430 came back to train for TI qualifiers and again I was benched. During my entire stay at IG no attempt at getting me a Chinese tutor or translator was ever made I was excluded from most team meetings because according to the management I did not understand Chinese I was never compensated for costs related to renewing my Chinese visa. Overall the management of the team was very poor and there was little communication between management and myself.  Fast forward to the beginning of post TI shuffle management didn't proactively let me know whether they had a spot on the team for me and whether Ferrari430 would stay or leave. In the end Tian and I had to wrestle the truth out of them they did not want me on the main or IGV roster but said that they would make a third team for me. This sounded like a poor attempt at benching me again for a season since no players other than myself were confirmed for IG's 3rd team. Guess what? Its October and IG does not have a third roster.  Their excuse was that I could not communicate with the team when in actual fact my mother is Shanghainese and that makes me half Chinese and I understand all the dota2 terminology items heroes skills how to coordinate in fights I was also willing to learn.  The truth of the situation is that they were already in talks with bigger name players and they had time left on my contract and didn't know what to do with me. When we asked them who was on this supposed 3rd team of IG or even what the name was no information could be provided to us.  There are a lot of rumors on the Chinese forums that I left IG because I could not speak Chinese or eat Chinese food. That is all false I can understand enough Chinese for pro dota and I love Chinese food but I also enjoy western food. Is that a crime?   I really wanted to continue playing with my boys in IG but management didnt let me. This is when Tian started negotiating my release from IG because they didn't have any real plans of having a third team as far as I know I was going to be benched for another season. I would rather go back to school if I could not find a good team and was a sub doing nothing again.   I was finally paid my winnings from NEA late September and it was 51200 RMB out of a grand total of 800000 RMB and the rest of the players were paid over 100000 RMB. I am also yet to be paid for my DPL (over $2000 USD)  or G-League winnings (over $2000 USD).   When we contacted IG regarding the discrepancy between what I was paid and what was promised they made excuses and eventually cut contact with us. They simply don't acknowledge that they promised me equal share of prize money even when presented with proof VK (IG CEO) even went as far as belittling my manager for wanting more than I got and that it was a joke that we were even talking to him for so little money because he is such an important man. In the end VK (CEO) Zhili (COO) have all stopped replying messages from Tian and myself and I am short over $12000 USD.  I am deeply sad that such a world renowned club would be ruined by such poor management. How many players have been ripped off by IG or other shady clubs? Will Ferrari430 ever receive his Ferrari promised to him by IG? Are promises worth nothing unless written in the form of a contract?   Here are the transcripts (In Chinese) between Tian and IG.Zhili (IG COO) The transcripts are basically Zhili promising us equal share of prize money and when confronted with his own chat history he ignores us.  http://imgur.com/a/9F4bG  Here are the transcripts (In Chinese) between Tian and IG.VK (IG CEO) The transcripts are VK belittling Tian and basically ignoring the evidence that the COO of IG promised us equal pay.  http://imgur.com/a/wK2Oh  I don't see how I will ever get this 12k back and it is a lot of money for my family and I. I guess I am just really sad about this whole situation but I have learnt my lesson. Finally I just want to make it clear that my beef is with IGs management and I have NOTHING against the players in IG I made many friends there and I am grateful for that and still chat with them day to day.   If on the off chance that Wang Sicong reads this post please return to me what I am owed and stop letting bad management ruin IG.

Open letter to Valve: do not work with PGL again,self.DotA2,Hi everyone. Im one of the talents from the Russian-language commentating studio at large Valve tournaments and this is an open letter to them and to PGL. I dont find it necessary to introduce myself as most of the viewpoints and opinions expressed in this letter are in no way my personal ones but rather collective. The central message of this letter can be summed up as follows: Valve please take action and deal with PGL.  Now to specific points. I think it will be reasonable to split this letter into several segments dedicated to each of the Majors. That will be the best approach.  The Manila Major  Last season Valve was actively testing various contractors apparently in order to find the optimal one for cooperation on a permanent basis. That was how ESL got Frankfurt PW got Shanghai and PGL got Manila. At the time it was PGLs first Dota tournament; the tournaments theyd organized previously were in other disciplines which was why we were a little worried here: firstly on account of the long traveling distance and secondly because the organizers might not have an entirely clear idea of what Dota was what made it different from other disciplines and what product the viewers would like to see. However our doubts were gone almost the minute we began cooperating with them.  First we were told that our plane tickets to the event venue were business class. This was a real gift to us as business class is significantly more pleasant than economy when your flight takes half a day. I suppose its fairly obvious. Thus we traveled comfortably to the venue were accommodated at Manilas best hotel were treated to food drinks and themed events such as Oktoberfest (although that was perhaps a disputable choice seeing as Oktoberfest coincided with the last night before the playoffsbut it was there nonetheless) an American cuisine night a Chinese one etc. etc.  The organization of the tournament itself was also top-notch and we were more than satisfied. The absence of delays or lengthy pauses or communication issues between talents and organizers made for an unforgettable tournament the best of the three Majors in the 2015/16 season.   I dont think theres a point in describing PGLs work at TI as most of the work there was done by Valve and MCW events while PGLs resources were focused specifically on the English-language livestream. Everyone was OK with thatPGL Valve and ourselves. This looks like a very positive letter so far doesnt it? Well not really. Problems would begin later.  The Boston Major  Valve cut its Majors budget for the 2016/17 season. Thus while during the debut season the contractors had been given a blank check and could ask for however much money they needed this time the budgets were fixed. Nevertheless they were more than enough to create a comfortable environment for everyone while also turning a profit. Not as large as in the previous season but a decent one too. However PGL decided it should make just as much money and went into saving mode. This is where it gets interesting.  Firstly business class flights were out of the question nowwhich was indeed clear to everyone by that point. Were no superstars whod complain about something like thatalthough granted it was something of a letdown to go back to economy having tasted all the perks and comfort of business class. There were however other and more serious issues.  Besides slashing the budget this year Valve decided to test a system where analysts would work from home.   Essentially the experiment disappointed no-one. Many analysts said it was nice to not have to travel to the other side of the world when you could stay at home. Jetlag and acclimating are after all difficult things that everyone experiences in their own way.  However introducing this practice created the need for an assistant contractor to help PGL set up analyst panel for the Russian broadcast and establish communication between commentators and analysts in Boston and Moscow/Kiev respectively. As many of you know there were only two obvious options here: to entrust this task to either Starladder or RuHub. PGL made up its mind and announced a bidding procedure for an assistant contractor. Bids were written up and sent to Romanians for consideration.  I was in touch with RuHub staff at the time and they were a little worried as they wanted very much to organize an event of this kind while realizing that the head of PGL is a good friend of the head of Starladder. Thus there were misgivings and they eventually proved not unfounded.  A few weeks after the consideration (the reason for the quotes will become clear later) PGL wrote a letter to RuHub saying they had chosen Starladder as the contractor.  During that time Valve was deciding on a list of commentators analysts and the presenter who were to take part in the event. The list was made and invitations were sent out to commentators. Sent out isnt perhaps the right term. MCW Events who were in charge of travel accommodation and other things related to commentators asked them to fill in requests which could be used to book plane tickets hotels etc.  The personalities who were to be involved in the analyst panel received nothing. A few days after PGLs choice in favor of Starladder a Starladder employee contacted Goblak XBOCT PGG NS and Faker the folks Valve had decided to invite for covering the tournament. Each of them got a different wording. Some were addressed in an official style; with others the format was Hiya you are from Kiev arent you so I suppose you wont need accommodation? To say those people were surprised would be an extreme understatement. For instance Goblak who wasnt an employee of either RuHub or Starladder might have no idea what they were even talking about.  Everyone unanimously declined to participate. The following day a group chat was set up on Skype with a certain Silvio who was one of the top people at PGL (or the top person Im not sure). The chat included all the people whod declined to participate Silvio and a Starladder employee. Silvio introduced himself said that Starladder had been chosen as the contractor and that the people were invited to work on December 211. Any questions? was the last sentence of that message. It sounded as if decisions had already been made and no-one had a choice. This is hardly how an official invitation to a tournament ought to look like. Over the course of the following hour the same thing happened all over again: all the analysts and the presenter declined to participate. OK Silvio wrote and the conversation ended.  That same evening it turned out Valve had been entirely out of the loop on the bidding prodecure and PGLs choice of Starladder. This is not to complain about Valve who had after all handed over the organization of the tournament to other people. Nonetheless the matter was investigated as it was in no-ones best interest to leave viewers without analysis at an official livestream. In a conversation RuHub found out that the bid had actually never existed. The bids had been a pure formality and PGL had ALREADY handed over the organization of the analyst panel at the point when RuHub had only just sent their bid inStarladder hadnt even written theirs. The absurdity of the situation was at its peak.  Valves decision was to give the livestream to RuHub which PGL had no choice but to accept. The viewers won out as besides the invited analysts it was now possible to get together a full-fledged analyst panel in Moscow. RuHub provided the money that was paid to the unofficial analysts. In total RuHub took pretty much money out of its own pocket even though setting up the Russian stream was initially supposed to be funded by PGL. With the amount theyd provided however if not a penny had been spent on RuHubs part the analysts wouldve been sitting on stools in front of a coffee table with an old Soviet portable TV set to watch the matches on.  Speaking of money PGL naturally decided to cut the salaries too. Compared to Manila where everyone was paid what we can designate as 1.3k gold the Boston salary was 1.0k gold for everyone with no distinctions. Moreover people would only find out how much they were paid upon checking their bank accounts a month after the tournament. Meaning that PGL didnt have a definitive notion of a salary in mind. Not as far as Russian talents were concerned anyway. English speakers always engage in personal dialog with the organizers and negotiate their salaries themselves. For instance the absolute top-tier commentators and analysts can earn 4k gold for a tournament; for talents in a league below them the figure is 23k gold; and for the presenter 56k. In a handful of cases with the young and inexperienced the organizers are able to pull off paying what they pay the Russian speakers. The organizers didnt want to discuss the issue of salaries with our representatives; they werent interested.  It was time for the tournament to begin. Out of the entire coverage staff 6 commentators traveled to it at PGLs expense (Lex had been refused a visa) along with 3 or 4 tech people and that was it. Whereas earlier any organizer would provide the budget for a content maker and a cameraperson this time the suggestion was to bring them along at ones own expense or not at all. Doesnt that sound like a good idea.  Upon arriving at the tournament the commentators and players began to feel the austerity. You only get food if you work/play on that particular day is a really strange formula. And while an organization like EG might not particularly care who paid for their lunch it could be a problem for teams without an organization or sponsor. Thankfully the commentators did work every day so they got food every day too. Its quality however left something to be desired. There were other small organizational nuisances but they werent critical and its hard to remember most of them by now.   The Kiev Major  You might think those were the juiciest and most interesting bits of this letter but wait theres more. Quite likely if the Kiev tournament had gone well this letter wouldnt have had to be written in the first place. This time however the organizers went even further.   People started getting invitations to the tournament at the end of March. A new system was introduced. Besides the main invites there was a list of backup commentators and analysts: those who would be invited if some of the core ones were for some reason unable to go to the tournament. People began to wonder what Valves selection principles even were.  There was information that Valve put a certain committee in charge of selecting people for large tournaments. Said committee consists of a certain number of people who assess the quality and working style of various personalities and come up with a list of required invitations based on their own judgement. Here another question arises: who selected the committee members themselves and on what basis? No names are provided for no apparent reason. That is to say there is of course one obvious reason and thats to prevent any attempts at influencing these people to get them to pick personalities that would otherwise not have been invited. But there are two sides to this coin. A member of the committee may also be inherently biased against a specific person and be a factor in their absence from tournaments.   In and of itself putting a group of people together is a very good idea since it immediately precludes any bribery on the part of competing organizations. However in order that the group itself doesnt raise any questions their identities ought to be disclosed and an explanation provided as to what merits and/or accomplishments earned these particular people the honor of assessing the work of talents.   Another problem with the issuing of invites was their quantity. An odd number of commentators and an odd number of analysts made planning our work and schedules complicated. Im going to skip ahead here and show you an ordinary example: here we have 7 invited commentators (with 4 parallel livestreams during the group stage) and 5 analysts (so theres no sensible way to split them into shifts). What was the problem with inviting one more commentator and one more analyst? We never got an answer to that question. The funniest thing about it all was that the number of people invited to the home major was one-and-a-half times smaller than the number of talents at the English-language studio. And while that system hadnt raised too many questions before this time the decision was quite baffling.   But enough about invites already. They invited who they invited even if it did cause a number of problems. After the invites were issued discussions began between PGL and the Russian-language talents concerning payment and everything else. Shouldnt the very fact that an inviter doesnt bring a specific salary offer to the table raise some eyebrows in 2017? It certainly raised ours.  v1lat was chosen to speak on behalf of the Russian-language talents as there was no point in discussing it all individually. We were on friendly terms with each other and wanted to present a united front rather than be disparate voices. For the first few weeks PGL was evasive didnt name any sums and was generally trying to avoid clearly answering the remuneration question. Finally they said everyone would have the same salary as in Boston (1000 gold) regardless of their workload. In the meantime the English-language talents were each discussing their salaries individually and there was talk of the organizers paying certain personalities 500 gold per work day + 300 gold for flight days adding up to about 4000/5000.  A situation like that suited pretty much no-one. Firstly working in the hall is a bit of a different story from sitting back and just working for the internet. When you see people behind your back when youre in the same room with them you cant help feeling that much more nervous.   Meanwhile an option discussed with v1lat was for him to not be a commentator at the tournament at all but instead to be the presenter interviewer and interpreter for the official Russian livestream. The discussion got stuck as Vitaly didnt want to do that and PGL forgot about that conversation. However the topic of money continued to be discussed. PGL were actively insisting This is all the budget youve got there wont be any more money. The talents started to get annoyed; PGLs indifference was stupefying for many. A week before the official announcement the Romanians simply ceased all communication with the Russian-language talents ignoring them completely. Nice business tactic there present them with a fait accompli and then just ignore them. Many considered pulling out of the tournament. Perhaps if that decision had been made wed have been able to break PGL. But this being a domestic Major who everyone with no exceptions wanted to work at the pressure was much too strong for us to be able to gather our willpower and walk out. In the end PGLs tactic worked. While they were ignoring our folks and we for our part couldnt reach a consensus the official announcement was made and there was nothing more to be done. PGL had won.   People stopped thinking about money; the important thing was after all to make sure the domestic Major goes well to prove that the CIS deserved to see a return of Valves tournaments in the seasons to come. A few days before the tournament the talents from Russia found out that thered be no invites from the organizers i.e. PGL didnt care at all whether people would get to Kiev or not it just wasnt their concern. Visas are another matter where no-one is protected from a potential refusal. But people have always been getting invitations. Here however the approach was sort it out on your own. Its very fortunate that RuHub and Starladder are based in Kiev as it was they who sent the invitation to the Russians. However PGLs indifference started to get positively irritating at that point.  The talents from Russia were scheduled to arrive on April 20. And accommodated at a $400-a-night hotel. Yet again one is left wondering: whats the point of bringing people in four days in advance when they could arrive a day or two before the tournament (the Kiev/Moscow difference is indeed greater than say the Moscow/Seattle one) and bring in another person with the money saved (13 x 400 x 2 = $10400). In the end they didnt have to book a hotel for the Kiev folks (v1lat Faker GodHunt and Goblak) and that would have given them the money to bring in another person or even two. Yet PGL has a certain problem reasoning logically.   After everyone arrived and was accommodated the Romanians decided to have a private conversation with v1lat so that an earlier unfinished chat on Skype could be brought to a meaningful conclusion. In the course of that meeting it turned out PGL had FORGOTTEN that a tournament required a presenter on stage an interviewer and an interpreter. No big deal you know just the main organizer of a tournament forgetting to invite three extra people happens all the time. Vitaly was told the following: Its your crowd and frankly we dont care what youre going to do. Have the interviews interpreted if you wish or dont. This is your business its got nothing to do with us. I suppose it goes without saying that Vitaly was not going to get any additional payment for taking charge of these tasks.  Naturally Vitaly wasnt satisfied with this arrangement and refused it (although he did act as an interpreter in the end). Salary raises continued to be discussed that same evening. PGL only agreed to give some extra coin (1200 gold instead of 1000) to a single person: Faker the main host. The following explanation was provided: We took a look at the schedule and didnt expect there to be so much work. Towards the end of the tournament theyd go back on their promise and say hed be getting as much as the others seeing as there was no budget for anything else after allhence 1000 and thats the end of that. A new catering strategy was also tested at the tournament: people ordered food from restaurants with MCW Events twice a day and the latter was in charge of delivery. I dont want to go into detail on that situation but long story short half of the orders took 4 hours to be delivered some werent delivered at all some people had their orders mixed up etc. Overall no-one was surprised as that system had looked flawed from the outset.  It was tournament time. The English broadcasters were working from Romania and the Russian ones from the CyberArena in Kiev. First game; everythings fine. Except the English stream had live reporting with cameras at the hotel and the Russian one didnt. Why not? Because the Romanians had forgotten there was a Russian stream. Thankfully the head producer of the Russian broadcast took to flooding the Romanians inboxes until starting from the second game the live reports were there.   Also people might have noticed that the look of the Russian stream was quite different from what PGL was showing. The problem was that the tournaments chief organizer was acting as if they were exclusively a contractor of the English stream and no-one else. For this reason plans concerning the content of the English stream were never put forward.   But that wasnt the problem. Our analysts biggest complaint was the absence of ordinary laptops. This was something that had never been seen at a tournament before. Of late folks had stopped bringing their own laptops seeing as organizers often ask not to put them in shot since some models would not fit in and would ruin the visual cohesion etc. That was why there were no personal laptops at the tournament. Neither however had any been provided by the organizers. And that problem wasnt dealt with before the end of the tournament even though there were some hopes. The absence of laptops adversely affected the quality of analysts work as they had to analyze matches based solely on what the observer was showing and nothing else.   The group stage trudged to its conclusion; streams were on for 15 hours a day but everyone was preparing for the playoffs so there werent any particularly strong misgivings. Everybody wanted to focus their attention on what was the main event of the year for the CIS.   The plan for the analysis room was to make it very impressive-looking and swanky. But then on the night before the broadcast the table that was supposed to be inside it broke so we had to fetch the one from the CyberArena. No-one went into details on how and why it had broken but it already was a bit of a disappointment. Later there was information that the broken table story was made up and thered been no table to begin with. That information however is an unconfirmed rumor so well leave it at that. There were also no laptops but you could already see that on our streams.   The following directions came from the Romanians during the playoff stage: Anyone who wasnt officially invited to cover this tournament CANNOT take part in activities. Youve seen live segments with Dendi XBOCT ArtStyle Resolut1on and Fly. That was initially forbidden. PGL itself stopped bothering about its own rule on the second day of the playoffs and we made use of the opportunity. Aside from that the credit for what did go on the streamwhat there was of itshould go to the talents and the Russian production team. PGL was entirely fine with just having an analysis match analysis type of broadcast without any video content if need be.   All of the camera people editors interviewers and others worked pro bono here; they received no payment for their work. And most importantly PGL had complaints even there. In the CyberKiev video where v1lat was sitting on the CyberArena stage talking about the history of Dota and the Kiev esports scene the Romanians spotted a half-covered Blizzard logo behind his back. Notably Valve wasnt particularly bothered about it while PGL simply couldnt live it down. Here we see them no longer completely unconcerned about what was going on the Russian stream. They simply sought to complicate things for everyone and they were willing to use any petty pretext for that.   There was a clear problem with the schedule and match times. Playing would go on for 16 hours partially due to large pauses between individual games and the series themselves. However on the third day PGL shortened the airtime of various interview at its own discretion so games now took a little less time to begin. Nevertheless it did not crucially affect the schedule as the third matchday still finished long past midnight. However the organizers showed understanding in responding to this situation (their only appropriate response during the tournament) and thus they allowed the analysis panel to finish working earlier and get at least 56 hours of sleep (here we ought to point out that these people woke up an hour and a half before going live and went to bed half an hour after broadcasting ended).   The problem of PGLs indifference to the Russian-language talents manifested itself in every kind of small details. For example on the first day the talents asked for juice to be added to the selection of drinks where Red Bulls and sodas were on offer. PGL ignored that request for two days. At the tournament itself there were several Valve representatives and when on the third day the talent asked the same of Valve juice and ice tea were available at the canteen a mere hour later. A small but very telling detail.   As workers we were left with an ambivalent feeling after the tournament. The home crowd had certainly saved the event; everybody was pleased to work for their own audience and gave it their best. But many of us strongly resented PGLs indifference and complete lack of interest in delivering a good product to the local audience. Were anything but spoilt but none of us had ever encountered an attitude like that at a Valve tournament. It was this indifference this couldnt-care-less mindset that led me to write this letter.  Id like to end my letter on the same note I started it with. Dear Valve please make sense of this situation and conduct your own investigation. The Russian-language talents and production staff are at the end of their strength and willingness to work with PGL on any future event. I hope you will take steps and well once again be able to bring joy and positivity that will not only be characteristic of our work but also felt by us when we arent facing the cameras.  For their part readers and ordinary viewers will probably be able to draw a lot of interesting information from all thats been written here. To summarize lets go through the main points of this letter:  1.  The Manila Major was fantastic; we were endeared by the comfortable working environment the organizers had created. 2.  Ahead of Boston Valve implements a new system of studio operation with on-site commentators and stay-at-home analysis panels. There is a need for an additional contractor for the analysis panel. 3.  PGL announces a bidding procedure but makes its own choice in favor of Starladder even before the deadline for the bids as the head of PGL is good friends with the head of Starladder. 4.  Valve finds out about this manipulation and hands organizing Boston over to RuHub. Meanwhile the budget PGL was supposed to provide for setting up the studio is virtually nonexistent and RuHub spends a big amount of money out of its own pocket. 5.  Information appears ahead of The Kiev Major about a talent-selecting committee whose members names are not disclosed. Its never established who these people are and what gives weight to their votes.  6.  PGL present everyone with their invitations as a fait accompli without any mention of salaries. Over the two weeks that follow the Romanians dodge the question and then say the pay will be the same as in Boston; when an attempt is made to discuss a raise they cite a limited budget and begin to ignore all attempts at contact. 7.  Kiev Major becomes the first tournament whose organizers refuse to send invitations to talents and say it isnt their problem. 8.  After everyone has gathered in Kiev PGL organize a meeting with Vilat at which they mention in conversation that they are completely indifferent to what happens on the Russian stream whether it will have translations of interviews live reporting or anything else. This is not the concern of the tournaments chief organizer.  9.  Every request made during the course of the tournament even a small one is completely ignored by PGL. Meanwhile Valve staff present at the same event resolve the same issues in minutes.  10.  PGLs indifference to Russian coverage is haunting people throughout the event. Instead of the tournaments chief organizer PGL look like a contractor of the English stream. Thank you for taking time to read this.,complaint

WESG wants to deduct my team's winnings telling my team and I to pay for 5 return airtickets amounting to 1700USD,self.DotA2,"This is my very first time on Reddit. Many friends and gamers told me i could post here and seek for advice and help. I thought about it and its really unpleasant to make a post here as the tournament is still going on (Finals in March 2018). However i would like to reach out to all managers and players to be very careful with booking of their air tickets and I sincerely do not want this to happen to another team and their players. (Please bear with my bad English and correct me as I go along Thank you)  Our Team Kazakhstan won first in their qualifiers and therefore attained tickets and a slot at the regional APAC finals at WESG. Visas were so difficult to get approved from the China Embassy whether individual or group visa. As for individual visas I had tried to request for ""barcodes"" from Alisports for instant approval but after waiting for 3 weeks Alisports told me its not possible to get barcodes anymore and told me to find other ways to attain our visas. I then told my players to get group visas which needed a lot of documents (for example bank statements and police statements and many more). One of my team player was located at another far end of Kazakhstan and he flew to the main city to try and get his individual visa done but to no avail as there are only 2 Chinese Embassies in Kazakhstan and the one he flew to do not issue individual visas without barcodes.  Monday 8th January was our proposed starting date of WESG lan. We are instructed to be there at 8th January to report at the hotels. And we only attained our group visas at 5th January (worth 420 USD) and I asked for 2 way tickets routing from Kazakhstan to China (back and forth) I even drafted a route with all my 5 players domestic flights and told the interpreter to book the flights proposed. I received a proposed flight plan back and it was not as i stated in the email but because all the flights that was in the proposal could bring my players back to their respective cities i said yes and told them to hurry with the ordering of tickets.  Some domestic flights started at Sunday morning and All my players had to fly to Almaty Kazakhstan then take a flight together to Beijing. And i will meet them in Beijing via a flight from Singapore. And then 6 of us will take the same flight from Beijing to Qingdao (WESG lan). Many times i asked the interpreter to put me on the same flight with them from Beijing but apparently (later i found out) she did not convey this message to the tour agency and just told me ""its not possible"". I received the tickets all on Saturday morning and i paid 80 USD from my own pocket to get the flight changed so i can meet my players and fly with them together to qingdao.    Food was mentioned to be provided for all days throughout WESG but it was not the case for the first day (and also last day of WESG) when we arrived. Many teams were shocked that food was not provided on first day but we were all excited and did not really bother about it. Organisers told us that because they were not able to estimate the number of teams that would arrive on the first day and therefore did not order food for us on first day.  Anyways this is not the main issue WESG APAC was completed successfully and the event was a blast. All players enjoyed themselves in that one week and we all had flights back to our countries on 15th January. We won 3rd place at the event by the way.  15th January Monday itself i paid again out from my pocket to fly back to Singapore via Shenzhen to my family business lodging at a later time because WESG gave me tickets that were so early in the morning at 0755am and this means i had to leave my players alone in China all the way until 2200Hrs at night where they will have their domestic flight from Qingdao to Beijing. I ve never really planned to leave them alone so ive changed my tickets to depart at 1800hrs instead. We were notified to check out of hotel rooms at 12noon but i paid for the room to be extended until 1800hrs (like some other managers did the same as well) for the safety and comfort of our players.  My team went from Qingdao to Beijing reaching Beijing at midnight. Then a problem arised that they were not able to have boarding passes for their respective flights as they were on group visas and they need to leave China together via the same flight. 3 boys leave on one flight from Beijing to Astana at about 2:30am and the other 2 boys will leave from Beijing to Almaty at 5:55am. The Beijing airport requires all domestic flights passengers to check out of the airport and to check in again with baggage and they do not have ample time to wait for answers and confirmation and thus they missed the very first flight to astana. So team leader tried to contact me via public phone calling to my Singapore number but i did not notice the calls until about 630am and team leader told me that they needed group airtickets.  I frantically called WESG organisers and asked them for help they were fast on helping me and tickets were booked for them however they needed to stay in the airport for one more entire day as the flights were early morning at 5:55am as a group this time. Throughout the time i attained the contact of the tour agency lady AA . who initially booked the tickets and she was in doubt about who was paying for the new tickets.  Alisports then dropped the bomb on me saying they will deduct the air tickets from our prize winnings.  Its now 24th Jan and I am still disputing this 1700 USD. They insisted that we should shoulder this amount as we confirmed the tickets before we took our flights to China. I wrote an email (i cut the email short here) to dispute the airticket charges stating these points with picture evidences and screen shots of our convos and emails.  ""1) Team Manager already informed interpreter XX about 5 times during conversation that our team booked group visa. It was proven to XX via emails and via wechat convos.   2) Team Manager do not have direct contact communication with Ms AA (tour agency lady) and when Manager asked Ms AA whether she was informed about the group visas Ms AA claimed she was not informed at all about this important and crucial information. If she had known we had group visas She would book return tickets as a group from Beijing into Kazakhstan because of her profession as a tour agency agent she knows about this visa rule.   3) Manager asked for 2 way tickets for the trips and also stated in the email that they are travelling on group visas (5 times mentioned to interpreter XX) when the tour agency gave us the draft copy we readily respected the wishes of the tour agency because we trusted WESG to be informed of our travelling documents and visas as we are only players/team and we do not have knowledge about ticketing terms and conditions.   4) Terms and conditions of the tickets were not known to us when WESG purchased the tickets. We were not aware that group visas required us to have the same exact tickets when travelling out of Beijing.   This email dispute is not to blame not to find fault and not to be critical against our interpreter but if words and messages are not conveyed in the proper manner or there is communication breakdown because of a middle man Then maybe WESG committee can see the loopholes and we all can improve on our errors and mistakes.  if you need further proof I can attach it via email for u. Please let me know if you need it because i am giving the interpreter the benefit of the doubt that she will say the truth with me.   Please kindly understand our positions and we came to China empty handed. I hope our prize money can help our family and the bad gaming conditions at home and make us be a better team for March finals.   Many thanks and Best regards Manager of Team Kazakhstan. ""     Today 24th Jan the director of Alisports Esports committee called me  and told me that the final decision has not been made yet. And alisports Still wants me to cover the cost of the air tickets.  I am hereby desperate and i am seeking fellow gaming community to give me advice and help on how to resolve this situation. We are only participants of this event if we did not win this 10k USD would Alisports help us with the booking of return tickets? one nice guy from alisports said yes but now i would like to tell all teams with managers or without that if you guys have group visas it is required for you to enter and also leave the participating country together as a group. No one but the travel agencies knows about this visa rule and yet this information was not passed to her.... The director told me this has never happened in the history of WESG. =(  Help me please. I think i really need help this time.   Thank you for patience.  Love Moon Manager for Team Kazakhstan",complaint

gg.bet the major sponsor of Team NP Empire and Ad Finem has terms and conditions which allow them to blatantly scam unwitting users and the community deserves to know,self.DotA2,"So a few days I go I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Betting/comments/5hjuda/started_using_ggbet_is_this_typical_policy_for/) asking if it was normal for betting sites to have heavy preventions on when you can withdraw your funds.  It seemed strange to me but I blamed my naivety for assuming these websites were legit. Honestly I was swayed by the site being a major sponsor of a few teams as I figured it was more likely that a legitimate business would have the money to spare for marketing like that.  All I wanted to do was play around with $50 watching the Boston Major. I figured I enjoy watching Dota games anyway I would pay to have a little extra thrill in each game with something personal at stake. So I go onto the most common site I see advertised gg.bet and see that there are multiple promo codes being shown to encourage new users to make a deposit. I don't know if I'm alone on this but **I never assumed that I would have to read the T&Cs to understand that by accepting any bonus money I practically eliminate my chances of ever getting any money back**. Unfortunately that is the reality.  When I made similar posts as earlier on /r/Dota2Betting I got talking to some other members and found out that this is **NOT** normal for betting sites to do.  /u/Patnor explained it best in this comment on /r/Dota2Betting:  > ok i wrote a long answer and i just deleted it after reading their bonus rules.  >GG.bet is a scam there is nothing else to say about the matter. And judging by how they have obviously just googled big words to sound more serious while infact they are just making an ass of themselves shows that its most likely some shady person behind the site.  >However. > You have accepted their Bonus which gives you 100% bonus deposit. This is the main rule thats keeping you from Withdrawing the money from your account.  >**You have to earn 25 times the amount of your deposit bonus.** Which means if you deposited 100$ you get 200$ and you have to earn a grand wopping 5000$ before you complete the bonus. And no im not done yet. **You have to do this within 30 days of you activating the bonus**.  >This is a rookie mistake everyone has made to be honest if you are new and you see a bonus its easy to think ""free money if i win"" But very few actually goes through their Requirements to actually pass the bonus as a whole.  >Also if you were to be lucky to win over 150$ with a freebet or anything you would lose every cent over 150$ which is kinda hilarious and extremely shady to have for any bookie that wants to be taken as a serious company.  >TLDR; You accepted bonus you now have to earn 5000$ in 30 days to complete bonus and being able to Withdraw the money. Cut your losses delete the account and simply keep away from shady sites like that.  >https://gyazo.com/77eb050ebbbf6a7a3e7a8d90513de23e  On top of this you can't even win it on ez bets with low-risk odds. It doesn't even count unless the odds are at least 1.75!  Initially I put $50 in to the account. The bonus code allowed me to double that then another code gave me another $12. So I had $112. I have made various bets winning all of them except for 1. Logically speaking if the site first uses my bonus money it should return bonus money **and leave my 'real money' untouched**. If it uses real money **it should return real money**. Instead gg.bet gives you bonus money and then effectively turns all your money into 'bonus money' that **you will never get back**. Unfortunately this was all in the terms and conditions but I neglected to read it. Yes this is my fault but that does not change the case that the website completely misleads its users. At best this practice is shady. At worst this practice is a total scam.  I spoke to support reps on their website's 24/7 live support. Once I tried my best to comprehend the broken english they confirmed that I could not withdraw any money basically ever. I then escalated this to a higher level of support and am still waiting for an email back almost a week later. It also asked if I wanted to save the chat logs but I never got an email with them in there? To make things even more confusing the bars shown in [this image of my account](http://i.imgur.com/SqsCPlV.png) count to 1250 and the other one used to count 300 but has since disappeared from the site entirely. The default is 1250 and I've earnt 40 of that. I suspect this means the amount of money I have bet on something with odds over 1.75 is $40 meaning I have to *bet* (NOT WIN) $1250 ONLY ON ODDS OF 1.75 OR MORE in order to get a cent back from the website. **On the third of January all of that money will just expire**.   I have emailed the site twice now asking for my initial deposit back. My initial deposit was $50 then my total balance from bonuses was $112. My current balance is $159.50. Though I am rightfully owed my winnings from my bet on EG vs VP I will settle purely for getting my initial deposit back since I am yet to lose it. Here is an [imgur album](http://imgur.com/gallery/L3WKX) showing the screenshots of my account for verification of all of this.  Has anyone else had any experiences with this? Since their support won't talk to me all I can do is dissuade anyone else from using their awful service and getting scammed like I have been. After looking into it a bit more it seems that Pinnacle is the best place for betting on e-sports though honestly I think this whole thing has turned me off the idea entirely.  **Edit 1:**  damn the reading comprehension of some people is poor. This is more of a PSA than a whine. I understand that this is my own fault for not being careful with my money however I think my mistake is one that a lot of people would make and this post is meant to serve as a warning and deterrent from these sites. People keep saying ""this is normal"". *Having to bet and win 25x your initial deposit on odds of 1.75+ all within 30 days is absolutely not normal* and is extremely scummy. Another point that people seem to be missing is my main complaint that by accepting the bonus money **my real money is effectively rendered completely void**. All I'm doing is raising awareness for suckers like myself that might be exploited and for teams to hopefully stop advertising this service. Teams absolutely have a responsibility to advertise decent companies consider the uproar when Navi sponsored an MMR booster on twitch. This is far worse this company effectively steals from its users. NP Empire and AF are helping this shitty company exploit their fans. The site also advertises [Fnatic a lot too so it seems that there are a huge number of esports teams that advertise for this company.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/5ic29z/_/db7fvcl)  **Edit 2:** I forgot to highlight another incredibly shady aspect of their T&Cs. IF you manage to meet their crazy requirements for a withdrawal in my case $1250 **I can only actually have $150 of that**. How can anyone defend this?   **Edit 3:** everyone saying issue a chargeback. I guess this must be more common in USA with your weirdly lenient refund policies but how would I go about doing this in Australia? I chose to spend this money I don't think my bank will just let me turn around and decide I want the money back now.   **Edit 4:** I just called my bank and told them and they said they'd get back to me so here's hoping. In the mean time /u/herro9n has done [some awesome investigatory work](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5iep9a/further_information_on_ggbet_and_their_shady/db7nzwa/) and found that gg.bet is just one of many fronts for a huge network of similarly shady gambling websites. Basically this isn't just one dude sitting behind his computer getting free cash this is a massive operation with many different websites all of which have similarly shady issues with customers wanting to withdraw money. I also just tweeted the teams mentioned to see what they think of this.  **tl;dr** using promotional codes on gg.bet allows them to turn your real money into ""bonus money"" which is designed in such a way that you will never get it back.",complaint

Team Secret Pay Your Players.,self.DotA2,"So a week has gone by since EE's blog and Team Secret's ""response"" is insulting to say the least. No apology no acknowledgement of the issue just as EE said it: ""empty words."". So does this mean Misery EE W33 and the rest are never going to get paid for their hard work? You're just going to let it slide and hope nobody notices? Well I hope to bring this back to the forefront once again so you can finally own up to your mistakes and show concrete steps being taken to remedy the situation. This blatant abuse of talent cannot go unpunished nor can it become the norm. It's time to finally own up and pay your players Team Secret.  I thought Team Secret was an organization created by the players for the players? Everything Team Secret has done to this point is antithetical to that ideal. It's time this organization examine itself from top to bottom to analyze and figure out just why this team has failed to live up to that standard. The statement put out by the team just shows just how flawed and out of touch the organization really is with the gravity of the situation. This is a symptom of an even greater problem within the organization.   Please Puppey if you have any respect for the team you helped create two years ago you will stop running from the problem and make your team the organization you wanted it to be. You felt screwed over by Na'Vi but now your team is starting to morph into something even worse. I know it's hard to be called out by ex-teammates but the best thing you can do to show them any respect is to give them the decency of a simple acknowledgement of the problem. Show them the steps being taken to make any outstanding payments and current players how payments are going to be distributed in the future. It is the least you could do. Running from the problem isn't going to fix anything and it's only going to get worse the longer you refuse to acknowledge the problem.   I've been a fan of Puppey since TI2 and Team Secret when it was formed after TI4. It pains me to see an organization I loved descend into ""this"".

Diablo 2 in Dota 2 is officially cancelled. Valve doesn't care about custom games. This patch broke them again.,self.DotA2,"Hey guys you might remember me from these posts  https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6uc841/diablo_2_in_dota_2_needs_your_help/  https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7jvwwp/how_valve_completely_destroyed_custom_games_with/  So after my first post Valve gave us the Custom game contest. Read all about that in the second thread.  Now a while has gone by from that thread and Valve has done literally nothing. I know that most of that time included the holiday break but come on it takes less then 10 minutes to send an email.  Today a patch dropped which did some great things as     * Most custom games on dedicated servers now crash instantly when loading in    * Outside of dedicated servers my RPG just crashes instantly when you select a hero    * Forcing a hero selection the quest system and inventory system are fucked. Probably will have to rewrite if I care. These systems took me over a year to make.    * Games that are lucky and dont crash like EBF or roshpit champions- Projectiles and all dummy units have healthbars and are vulnerable. Yep you can kill projectiles with auto attacks now. Invulnerability disabling health bar and a ton of shit just doesn't work anymore.     And today's patch wasn't even that big. What was even in it? Removed the Frostivus background the Frostivus custom game (someone must have hit the ""Remove all custom games"" button by accident) (Trivia: the game was removed a week ago. Did anyone notice?) and added some random leaks to a new hero.  They literally made the most MINOR of changes to the game and managed to completely break EVERYTHING in custom games.  The RPG is cancelled not me nor anyone on the team has enough patience with Valve to see it through. I will probably develop it as a standalone I didn't want to because its 2-3x more labor intensive but it's better then this.  The IMBA developers are fed up their game is incredibly broken as well. DoctorGester the modder behind Crumbling Island Arena has practically abandoned all modding. Darklord the modder who made Feastivus and Legends of Dota Redux has left.   Sorry just had to rant.  E/ To copy paste this response from the original thread- the game isn't a carbon copy of diablo 2 it is its own independent IP with characters and stuff but the gameplay was designed around the old school ARPGS like diablo. Referencing it as diablo 2 gives people an immediate feel about what the game is supposed to be about without referencing the entire 10 page GDD though.  2e/ The last patch fixed everything. As I said this decision is irreversible. This is the 999th time this has happened. It isn't an acceptable form of communcation.  Valve I know you read this thread.  Please just talk.

Valve Infusers were a bad idea. Don't bring them to future Major's content.,self.DotA2,"Infusers have been brought up before and they generally garner negative reactions.   Essentially infuser is a ""style unlocker"" upgrade similar to ""courier upgrade"" tools that have previously been added to various compendium levels.  **There are however 2 main differences that make this system unfriendly towards customers and disincentivizing in terms of pursuing aquisition of more infused sets :**  **1.** Unlike golden items / genuine items / generally unique items an ""infused"" item is the very same piece of cosmetic player already has but with unlocked feature. If a player has an item that also exists in some more ""extraordinary"" form (like golden) he arguably only posses an ""inferior"" version but the existence of separate fleshed out cosmetic is still undeniable. At the end of the day he has a set that is a result of hard work and creativity of the great folks over at the Workshop.   **Basically :** The fact that I have a set that is ""worse"" unless Infuser is applied diminishes my enjoyment from having acquired it. I'd rather know there was ""better version"" (like golden items) than be reminded every time I look at it in armory that I wasn't lucky enough to get an infuser.   **2.** Unnecessary focus on tier-ing of rewards. Compendiums were supposed to be about the event and associated with it community's participation. Players interacting artists promoting players performing.  With the new elements introduced in Fall Major (Infusers Coin Cache) and removal of anything remotely related to the event itself other than general information compendium became glorified cosmetics bundle that also gives access to buying more cosmetics and ""challenges"" which (in my personal opinion) hurt the game in general by introducing player-specific agendas.   **I understand those are just 2 general points** and many other players can voice their own criticism of Infusers and Compendium as a whole. Event was great matches were great but the digital ""interactive"" portion was subpar when compared to previous ones.   **Tl;dr** Please don't use Infusers in the future. Idea sucks. Just make separate ""rare"" items like you used to. ",complaint

Happy new year to everyone!  Been through some terrible experience at Team Liquid Store and thought it might be useful for some of you that are planning to buy there.  1. Around mid September the Windranger T-shirt with Rainmaker code was restocked on TL store. Some friends and I figured that we would like to buy some and share the shipping cost since Valve Store doesn't deliver to my country. So I placed an order for 5 T-shirts at $30/each. That's a subtotal of $150 plus $19.75 shipping cost. 2. On 17 Sep I received an email from TL store that my order has been shipped. But according to [USPS tracking](https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction?qtc_tLabels1=LN151272615US) it's stuck in Chicago since the second day. 3. On 26 Oct still haven't received my order yet and unable to track I sent the first email to TL support and they said it'd take up to 8 weeks to arrive. 4. On 18 Nov which is about 9 weeks after delivery I sent yet another to their support and was promised a refund. 5. But... I never received the refund and they haven't replied to my email asking for status for more than 2 weeks. (And my friend hasn't paid me either)  I had been a fan of TL since pre-TI3 days but things like this just make me advise everyone not to shop at TL Store.

Valve you're killing custom games with the Top 10 list. PLEASE FIX - I beg you,self.DotA2,"I've been playing and loving custom games since starcraft 1. I've always played them far more than the standard game. Played them for pretty much the entire duration they remained populated. That is of course until Starcraft2's custom games iteration.  The top10 list made finding a game not on it take an absurd amount of time if not completely impossible. Most of the games on the list weren't very fun I only found a couple interesting and could play those only so much before I tired of them. Where previous custom games were fun for literally years blizzard's implementation in starcraft2 got boring in mere months and I moved on.  I've been playing customs in dota2 since the start of reborn beta and actually for the past ~2 months completely stopped playing dota in favor of customs.  Most unpopular but very fun games enjoyed a population surge both at reborn beta launch and official launch but they are starting to run thin. They will die out completely very soon.  Your current implementation with both a Top10 list and a lobby list is certainly better than Blizzard's in Starcraft2 but only just barely and both are clearly vastly inferior to SC1/WC3 b.net. To illustrate very clearly just how much of an impact the Top10 list has just look at the Naval Warfare daily users. Was at a steady 2k-4k for a couple weeks. It dropped off top10 and overnight it went down to 200-700; it's all downhill from here.  It's still early for custom games but there are still several very good well made fun games that wouldn't be struggling nearly as much as they are now if 95% of the custom game playerbase wasn't playing a Top10 game. Warlock Brawl(20 playing now) The Predator(9 playing) Dota Strikers(17 playing) just to name a few. Developing custom games can take quite some dedication. It really must be crushing to pour your soul into these projects for no incentives and soon find your game at a constant ~0 users because it can't compete with super casual/pve games that always have a larger playerbase.  So here are my suggestions:  * Remove Top10 list completely. You tried your experiment with implementing both a Top10 list and lobby list it didn't work. Please do not delay before it does serious damage to the custom game community. * Make the lobby list the first thing you see once you've clicked on the Custom Games tab. There is a significant part of the playerbase that doesn't even know the lobby list exists(I'm serious)! This has several detrimental effects which I'll go further into a little bit further down. * Keep the other sections of the current overview tab but rename it to suggested games. I never really see any games consistently on the suggested games section so I don't think this can become another Top10 list.  And finally just a couple quality of life changes that aren't super-important but definitely worth mentioning.  * Make lobby leader always the in-game host. The way it works right now(assuming there's zero lobbies with slots open) is if I don't click the ""create custom lobby"" button and instead click ""Play Warlocks Brawl"" I will make a lobby and be assigned lobby leader but once the game actually starts whoever loads the game the fastest will be given the host slot of the game. So for instance I'm a USWest host I click ""Play Warlocks Brawl"". 8 other USWest players go to lobby list see my USWest game and join. 1 SEA player with a $10000 machine doesn't know about the lobby list clicks ""Play Warlocks Brawl"" and gets put in my lobby. Game starts he loads first and now everyone has 300 ping(except him of course). I'm not certain how this affects games with dedicated servers but really as long as there's any customs without them there's no reason for this sloppy host-assigning. Also if you create a custom lobby manually the proper way and you leave this breaks the lobby and in-game host will no longer be assigned to lobby leader whoever loads first gets it.  * Related to my prior point there's no indication of the server location in the lobby rooms. So if you enter a lobby either through direct invitation clicking on a channel invite button ""join my lobby - click here"" or through clicking ""Play XXX custom game"" there is absolutely no way to tell what region you're going to be playing in(the little connection indicator bars are not enough).  Many people think custom games will be taking server settings from the dota 2 matchmaking component and will often leave once they see their high ping which can ruin the game for other players. The fix is clear include this information at the top of the lobby popup.",complaint
The DotA 2 tutorial is really fucking garbage.,self.DotA2,I was teaching my 11 year old cousin DotA yesterday and god damn it was the worst experience ever.  1st of all when he tried to buy items it would only let him buy items IN ORDER of the recommended items list.  He tried to buy the item at the end of the list and it just would not let him (god knows why).  Next when he died to the tower the 2nd time (which is normal) I wanted to have him TP back to lane but it would not let him buy a teleport scroll so he had to walk back to lane.  ----------  After I finished that tutorial I was thankful that it was over so I could start the next one... then I realized it puts him in a FULL FLEDGED BOT GAME already! And the bots are fucking rude. They are really aggressive and would go to kill him all the time.  -----------  So next I started a game where we both played together against bots but after the 5 minute mark all the bots 5-manned down mid and he could not do anything.  ----------  At this point he did not want to play anymore. The only way I got him to keep playing was by starting a bot game and making him nearly 6 slotted in the beginning so he can run around and one shot people and actually enjoy playing the game.  --------- TL;DR  It is super frustrating  /endrant,complaint
You can't play Dota 2 if you don't have internet connection,self.DotA2,Sometimes I don't have an internet connection so I'd like to play a bot match. I open steam in **offline mode** and start playing vs bots.  Now in Reborn this option is not possible because 20-30 seconds into the game it disconnects and you can't do anything about it.  So please Valve let us play vs Bots when we can't connect to Steam.,complaint
Azubu still refusing to payout tournament prices after almost a year,self.DotA2,I want to make people aware that up to this date which is almost a year later Azubu still hasn't paid most of the teams that participated and won money in their tournaments.  Specifically im speaking about this tournament series: http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/Game_On_Invitational/3  Azubu paid GameOn to host some tournaments but actually almost no team ever got paid. There are several helpful people that tried to raise awareness of how Azubu ignores the payouts like Richard Lewis (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsg1sZGnYSs) and im really thankful to them but unfortunately Azubu still hasn't paid out our money.      We won 1500$ as Team Valkyrie (which i was the captain of) which may seems like a small sum but to tier2-3 teams it can mean a whole lot (like upgrading outdated gear/hardware which significantly improves gaming experience). So basically as a last resort im posting this on Reddit seeing that Azubu is happily expanding (they merged with Hitbox and are now called Smashcast) and spend money left and right but refuse to pay our 1500$ which is like a spit to the face for lower tier tournaments.  I hope the dota2 community can help.  Thanks for reading,complaint

"Valve Please do not bring back these ""Tiered Treasures"" next Major.",self.DotA2,"I have bought at least a level 50 compendium from Major tournaments since TI3 and I've loved everything thats been done.  But this Major I am simply pissed off. I can completely understand that you dont want the compendium to be at TI level because it would be difficult to pump out that many super quality compendiums 4 times a year but these Coin treasures are absolutely awful.  The bronze and silvers look awful so its all about the Gold sets and crafting up to them which requires playing and doing challenges to get coins which I get. BUT WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BE SO HARD TO GET.  I have opened over 50 chests (20000 coins) in hopes of getting 1 Anti-Mage set and I couldnt do it. I have recycled over 200 items to get these coins. I understand its all about luck but why cant their be the same rules as other chests ""once you have unlocked a set you will not receive duplicates"". This is so annoying.  But the worst part of all is the fact that these sets are not Tradable they are not Marketable and they aren't even Giftable. If I want this set im going to have to keep recycling items keep playing and doing challenges and even then Im not guaranteed what I want. It is bullshit.  TL;DR - Tiered chests (Coin treasure) are fucking awful and shouldn't be a thing next major and if they are make them tradable for fucks sake.  **Small edit:** Ive had like 10 people offer to gift it to me. I dont know if you're trying to be nice or trolling but you cant trade or gift these EVER.",complaint

was wondering why ppd had a small twitch audience...,self.DotA2,... And I found out pretty fast. In a game he was playing carry and losing he flamed his team so viciously it was uncomfortable to watch. Invoker in his team made one bad play and he came upon him so hard I don't understand how the kid did not just leave. Then he proceeded to play out of his mind making play after play and ppd never cared to say anything about that.  At some point ppd got picked off right in the middle of the map all by himself with no vision and no allies close by and I decided to call him out on that on the chat and voi-la I got banned for life from the chat.

Playing in U.S East and U.S West is making old and new players leave the game,self.DotA2,"So this has a been an issue for quite some time now South America being in the NA servers. Which is fine this is the internet we are inter-connected and we're all nice people right? I've really been asking myself for 2-3 years what the issue is with them being in the game I know Spanish because of school I lived in Miami for 3+ years so it isn't a racial thing like many bring it out to be and I know that in their native countries there are some excellent players in the Peru and Brazilian communities but the state of the game in U.S East and U.S West is pushing away a lot of new and older players in ranked and unranked.   I've seen numerous posts I've seen numerous complaints and I myself have even taken breaks from the game myself because I can't communicate with my team. Dota 2 is my favorite game I've sunk almost 4000 hours into this game fuck I even met a guy online and went to his fucking wedding through this game. I can't connect with people though because they have some anime character picture and spam ""conchatumadre"" or ""jajajaja"" and constantly think their so high off of Arteezy or EE dust that they are above communication.   So does that make them any better than me? No but when you want to progress through mmr and the first thing you see is ""Me mid you shit K?"" or ""jajajajaja no is good invoker jajeejejeaja."" I literally know I am going to fucking go on a uphill struggle just to see them move from their lane after 15 minutes. Then the moment anyone on their team dies well there are the hot coals of the fuck you train as you now have to sit through a 40 minute game of them just feeding farming in jungle until they have their shadow blade as slark and flaming because bad parenting reinforced their small little minds that they don't do no bad and everyone else is wrong.   Its terrible and whats even worse is that trying to introduce people to dota I tell them they have to learn Spanish if they want to play on U.S East or West because not only is Dota one of the more mechanic prone games its one of the best team coordination games possibly in the world (://Bias) but I digress I can't hold these peoples attention for more than 3 games before I get"" Whats the point? You can't even understand or get to these people.""   I know Valve is a busy company and I know by the comments you guys make its a routing issue from Peru and Argentina but that doesn't excuse ignorance communication and overall lack of understanding of the game which is why this ruins Dota for us in the East and West. I've sat with you guys through the great Russian migration back in 2012 and I sat through fucking International fucking 4 (It happened I won't forgive you ice reptile you've gotten better and 7.01 is tits <3) and I am willing to sit through this shit as well but this has to be remedied.    **TL;DR** **Please do something about the Peruvians and Argentinians on US East and West**",complaint

Anyone else have their friends slowly stop playing since 6.83?,self.DotA2,I've noticed that tons of my friends have sorta just stopped playing since 6.83. A lot of people complained about the rubberband mechanics or the stale meta and I think that happens every patch. However what I've noticed is a huge non-vocal group of players just kind of got bored of the game. I think it has to with the fact it's extremely hard for a good player to snowball hard and carry a game unless you're playing troll / jugg / storm / etc. I've noticed that if you snowball hard early unless you can push high ground solo there's really not much you can do. It's extremely difficult to play an effective ganker mid or support in pubs. I think this led to more boring pub games and myself included have slowly just lost interest in the game. I think that the patch is worse than people think- not because of the complaints but because of the lack of them. I think a lot of people have just gotten bored and moved on. I would be really interested to see how many players with accounts over a year old have dropped off from playing compared to a similar timespan rolling over the past 2 years. ,complaint
Another daily reminder that Enigma's Black Hole is STILL missing its last damage instance,self.DotA2,This means you're missing out on 50/100/150 PURE damage (even more if you include spell amp) which can be the difference between killing someone or not (especially at max level ult since 150 pure damage would be about 7-9% of someone's max health as damage at that point in the match)  Also just tested this with Agh's upgrade and it still doesn't work. Since each tick of Midnight Pulse deals 5.25% of the enemy's max HP as PURE damage it means that Enigma's Black Hole with Aghanim's Scepter is currently missing out on 50/100/150 pure damage PLUS 5.25% of the enemy's max HP as pure damage. Since I stated that 150 pure damage is about 7-9% of an average hero's max HP at that point in the match Enigma's ultimate (with Agh's) is missing out on dealing about 15% of every affected unit's max HP as pure damage.,complaint

The biggest flaw in the new player experience is the Limited Hero pool itself,self.DotA2,"Helped introduce my younger cousin to DotA.  His first game had the 25 hero pool limit I said ""You need to learn the basics"". I thought it was great and all but then the enemy picked heroes that weren't in the 25. As expected they got dumpstered. And the game after that as well. Even I tried to help him in one game by playing in his stead the counters were not present in the 25 ESPECIALLY the support section.   Why are new players forced to play 25 ""basic"" heroes while getting matched with others who have access to all 100+? Wasn't this one of the main selling points to DotA over League? That new players would have access to everything at the very beginning?  No wonder the main complaint was ""DotA is hard to learn"". They already have inexperience against them the limited tools is added on top of that.  **EDIT:** People saying removing it will encourage smurfs I don't think it will. Regardless of whether a 25 hero limit or not is in place smurfs will always be present.   **However** a newbie PA CAN kill a smurf Sniper with a little luck regardless of skill level. But a newbie PA is unlikely to kill a smurf Tinker or a Phantom Lancer.  My whole point is either **force them all to play the same 25 limited heroes OR the same 100+ heroes** a **level and balanced** playing field.  **EDIT 2:** While you can remove the limitation via console that would mean **the player should already be knowledgeable enough to use the console in the first place which isn't the case for people trying out the game for the first time**. If we look at it from a **newcomer's perspective** they wouldn't know these commands eventually leading to shit quality first few matchmade games. Imagine how many potential new players we lost who simply tried the game and never came back.",complaint

Ongoing Connection Issue with Reborn,self.DotA2,"I have heard a lot about this problem the last few weeks and I've been unable to play for about 2 weeks total. I still haven't seen many  threads about it if any but it's definitely a major issue.    The problem looks like this:      Queue for a game.   Everyone accepts.   Loading screen flashes up for maybe 1 second.   Dumped back to main screen with ""reconnect"" button offered.   Hit reconnect button.   Loading screen appears 50/50 chance of reconnecting.   Once connected will be stable for a few minutes.   Suddenly game plays as if having huge lag spike. Hero frozen in place unable to click etc: but sounds continue and you can hear in-game voice. Occasionally will stutter back to life for a flash.   Disconnected message on main screen says ""Timed Out"".  Reconnect button is offered again 50/50 chance it will work.   Continue until game is over or you get an abandon.             I have no idea what this could be. It's not ISP dependent it's not server dependent - it affects me on EUW EUE RU. It's also affecting a lot of other players in the UK and I've heard it affecting other players in other regions.      I feel that this has to be a bug. I have no problems connecting to other online games no problem streaming on twitch no problems with internet in general. I run NetLimiter to check my usage and connection and it shows no change on my end wrt upload/download speeds.      ""Fixes"" that haven't worked.   Restarting Dota.   Restarting Steam.

My Take on why Meta gaming does not belong in Ranked,self.DotA2,"We have seen many post similar to this post on Reddit before but still I felt the urge to add my own thoughts on this so here goes.  When Ranked was first introduced Valve made this statement:   this mode is aimed at experienced players who want to play in a more competitive environment  This is important because it clearly states that the purpose of Ranked is to promote more competitive play.  Do you know whats not competitive? Having a game where half your team (and opponents) are running around trying to do quests or playing heroes they have very little understanding of. Thats not competitive! All the Meta stuff like compendium rewards and the all hero challenge belong in Normal mode! Ranked is supposed to be where tryhards like myself go when we want to push our self to be better and compete with like-minded people. And all this meta s*** is ruining my fun in the mode. The meta stuff changes how people play it gives them individual goals that they value above team play I can name tons of examples like people going for naked Agg septor or just being yolo mode because they need a double kill or whatever but I dont have to we all know this meta s***has a very real game impact!  thats all well and good but not in a competitive environment.  Dont get me wrong I am not hating on the compendium I love it! I love the fun it gives and I try to complete as many quest as I can myself BUT I do it in NORMAL mode.  So I beg you Valve remove it from ranked plz  Thx for reading kind regards.

Should Valve re-consider the sign ability for Techies' Arcana?,self.DotA2,Right now Techies can place a sign with their arcana.  In a way it's sort of a taunt but isn't this a little dangerous? In the Test Client it appears to Enemies.  Think of this scenario.   Techies rush to a rune spot and place a sign. They didn't actually mine the rune but they stuck a sign. Now there's an element of mind games. The enemy knows Techies were there. They might assume the rune is warded. They approach it with more caution and maybe they place a sentry. This probably wouldn't have happened without that sign there. Or at least it might have but a lot less mind games were at hand. Being able to pay to play Mind Games is not something Dota 2 needs.    It's also bugged to add wand charges and interact with Curse of the Silent. But those are bugs. The general interactions and mind games are NOT bugs.  What I think Valve needs to do is re-consider this addition. Remove it for now. Once it's in-game for real and people pay money it will be harder to change it. So it should be pulled until the game play elements of it are better explored. ,complaint
How Valve completely destroyed Custom Games with the contest,self.DotA2,Hey guys Id like to take a second to talk from a developers perspective about how much of an absolute trainwreck this competition has been from start to finish. Id like to acknowledge that while there have been concerns about the quality of the winning game I'd like to focus on the process that got us to this point instead of the game that won.  Lets start from the beginning  September 17 2017- Valve announces their competition. All of the developers think its going to be great so we all get to work immediately since 2 months is not alot of time. However there are huge issues in the rules like  * There is no grading criteria published whatsoever. How are we supposed to know how good our games are? Does art matter alot or is gameplay the only thing we should be focusing on? Do we have to worry about players on the Arcade or is it quality based only? (This mattered a lot for us our game requires 10 people playing at the same skill level to be extremely enjoyable). How closely do we follow Frostivus existing/new lore?  * What does No third party assets mean? Does this mean we cant use completely open source code like literally every mod on the workshop does (Lua JS (the languages you MUST use to build your mod) are third party assets!!!!) (Even the winning entry used third party assets! He let them know and they got permission from the owners to use them even when they were open source but still this is completely neglectful)  * Tons of other issues like not being able to submit contributors or dedicated servers working or there being existing mods given Frostivus tags  We emailed. Over and over and over. I personally sent 3 to every Valve address I know and got nothing back ever. These are ESSENTIAL RULE CLARIFICATIONS. There is absolutely no excuse for a professional contest with 30K on the line to not have rule clarifications.  Past that there's two months of people working hard with the deadline extension and stuff which Im going to skip since its controversial  Now comes the legendary Valve Email that was sent to two of us that Id like to talk about for a little while.  Past the deadline of November 24th Valve never locked the mods! So we could still update them and do whatever to them. Considering Valve didnt seem very organized noone had faith that they took copies of mods on the deadline for judging instead of just downloading them whatever (which they didnt in the end). This was SUPER important because people were literally still adding content past the deadline! So you created this divide between people who were creating content past the deadline to get an advantage and those who followed the rules. After 17 emails Valve finally responded a week after the deadline saying  > Regarding your ... question about updates bugfixes can still be submitted but are not guaranteed to be included in the review process.  This is probably the worst answer in the history of Valve answers that was ever given.  * This was not sent out as an official answer to anyone only over email to 2 (known) people. This is an incredibily important topic to all modders yet they couldnt even make a solid answer on this.  * What is a bug fix? Does Fixed a bug where the final boss didnt exist count as a bug fix? Are we going to be disqualified if we submit something that YOU consider isnt a bug fix? Are the people who updated before hand going to be disqualified? What does ANY of this mean?  * What does not guaranteed mean? Does this mean youre just hapazardly downloading games off of the workshop and playing them as is? This actually introduces RNG to who wins the prize! Two people just fixed crucial bugs to their game but valve played one before the crucial bug was fixed and one after so the one afterwards won. How is that remotely fair?  Needless to say the entire community was livid and up in arms about this but we heard literally nothing back.  Talking about the selection process for a bit a few days later Valve sends out this gem of a facebook post https://www.facebook.com/dota2/posts/1707884899276960  This directly states that subscriber count is a factor for judging! What a disaster!  The entire community became this clusterfuck of a race to beg all the big YouTubers to play their games and everyone kept breaking the bugfix rule too to add new content and whatnot to get active players so it just became an absolute disaster.  The final winner?  The one to rule them all?  Frostivus festival.  No coincidence  * Played by bulldog 3 times and had 2  (3?) separate videos about it to boost player count when all other mods had 1 at best * #1 on the subscriber counts out of all of the mods that were legal (Feastivus was higher but had copyright issues some other mods were higher but were just old mods tagged with frostivus)  I don't have to break it down that Valve obviously just grabbed the one with the most players.  Additionally it broke the rules of third party content (discussed earlier) (Thankfully did not abuse the bugfix loophole too heavily but that loophole was still a huge issue for us)   Regardless of what you think of the mod consider this- there is no second third or whatever place mod. Noone besides this one mod received anything at all from the contest not even feedback from Valve.  Lastly Valve doesnt have the guts to come answer up and talk about their judging process or how they felt that all of their competition was  > Thank you to all of the contributors who worked hard to help make this contest a resounding success.  I really feel a great sense of pride and accomplishment from this contest.  Custom games are over with this.

Another user (who claims that he has sold multiple keys there) says that they're lying provides proof ends up being banned from G2A and thus losing all his money in his G2A wallet.

Reminder that Tinker scripters are still a plague on Dota. Here is a pretty blatant proof I recorded.,youtube.com,,complaint
Since valve reduced the amount of reports ranked feels like low priority,self.DotA2,"Literally past 2 weeks in every game there are 1-2 people (minimum) who either cry all game call gg after 1 lost fight or afk/sell their items..  Before the reduced reports I only encountered those people in low priority. Now EVERY single one ranked game I have those kind of people.. It's not that I can't win it's just that i have to spend half of the game convincing someone that the game is not over cause i missed 1 sunstrike or that just because void missed 1 chrono you don't have to sell your items and feed.  I am 4.1k MMR EU West if it matters btw and 8.5k behaviour score   Edit: Just to clear things up. I don't care if people are ""unskilled"" or flame. I care that they sell their items and stop trying to win or just afk cause they are mad. I don't blame them for my loses.   **Edit2: HOLY SHIT guys we are almost the top thread. Lets hope valve notice us and either get the old report system back or create something new.**",complaint
All the guides ingame are 3-2 years old (except Torte De Lini's ).

These have no relevance in the current meta whatsoever. Please remove those useless guides. Guides should be visible on the basis of their last updates not popularity.  ,complaint

This game is fucking disguisting for genuinely new players.,self.DotA2,I have a friend who really wanted to play DOTA. He started like 2-3 weeks ago and after playing plenty of bot games he decided to give *real* matchmaking a try. I agreed to coach him but what I saw was beyond anything I've expected.   **1st game:** I told him to play *limited heroes* because i thought it's good for newbies. After ~4mins of waiting he was matched with people who played DOTA for 800-1900hours. Only he was a new player. Thankfully (or not) game ended after 10mins because 2ppl from his team left (limited heroeas have no penalties).   **2nd game:** SAME FUCKING SHIT - he was the only unexperienced player and ppl with 2k h dota played just stomped him. I was like: *OK maybe noone is playing this mode* And told him to play *all pick*   **3rd game:** I've checked account lvls at loading screen - bunch of 1 lvls and highest was 14. But guess what? Once more he was alone in a game with bunch of fucking smurfs. It was so painfully to watch. In the end he ended up *playing* (more like dying instanly) alone in his team because everyone left. He finished the game but till the very end other team was flaming him because he refused to leave.   I really have no idea how can I help him. It feels like it's impossible to play normal game with people on your level if you know nothing about DOTA. Why there are so many fucking retards who smurfs and just ruin games for those who wants to learn?   Sorry for bad englando,complaint

Ice Frog let me be the first to thank you for letting Visage have a positive win rate for 7 days before nerfing him again.,self.DotA2,No really I mean it.  I know that you have been phasing out 2spooky heroes like skeleton king(skelingtons) brood mama(spiders) and phantom lancer(ghosts are spooky too) so when I picked up Visage I knew that I would expect him to be changed to something stupid like Arc Warden.   I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that instead of just removing these heroes you were just trying to delete them from the game bit by bit. Slowly and stealthily like two snails fucking in your shoes. Messy and annoying as fuck to the few people who actually deal with it  Thank you so much for conquering your fear of shift and tab. Thank you for conquering your fear of birds. Of being able to be a level 4 crystal maiden at 12 minutes with no vision and not dying to birds instead dying to literally any other hero with common sense  now I know a lot of Visage players are going to be mad about them. And some would even say that there are problems here that won't really be fixed. In fact at lot of people will say that having your birds be able to be killed by 3 tower shots is a bit of a fuck you. Or that now monkey king can now kill all your birds at level 8 instead of 15  or that a single throw of beast masters axes can kill them  or 2 double helixes.   Or once lion gets aghs  or a keeper of the light q  or if someone leaves the door open and a gust of wind gets in  ect  is the exact kind of nerf that someone who doesn't actually play Visage would give him. Someone who is happy to let familiars rat down barracks and fly away at max movement speed but doesn't want Visage to use them constructively in team fights. Someone who never figured out what Gravekeepers is supposed to be anyway so he just slapped a raindrop passive on there and let it be.  and to be frank I'm glad that instead of letting the players decide where they want to play heroes we've put Visage back into his place  A trilane that doesn't make sense in a map that doesn't support it for a meta that doesn't exist any more  also Gravekeepers still isn't working right familiars aren't going immune while stone forming Familiars are no longer blocking pudge hooks familiars are being affected by sources of damage such as TA which kill them almost instantly Familiars damage regen is still bugged and only one person is reporting me for picking Visage so if you could fix some of these issues instead of ruining a hero you've never played or played against. That would be great.  sincerely one of the few people still playing this dumpster fire of a hero    ,complaint
Japan Server Captains Mode MMR Gain Abuser (With steam ID),self.DotA2,I was queuing Japan Server on AP/CM and accepted a game of CM. Once i entered the game the Main Abuser asked me in all chat.

He admitted he was abusing the system and threaten me to leave or let him end in 5 mins or i will get 9x reports and go to Low Priority right away.

Last attempt - Valve hasn't supported s2fm in a year. Everything breaks every major update,self.DotA2,Hello everyone  I obviously don't talk for the entire s2fm community but every bug we post ont he dev forums gets ignored. We used to have an sfm guy at Valve that would help regularly but I've heard rumors that he's gone to greener pastures (and based on glassdoor however relevant they may or may not be - valve is a resume buffer)   Anyways if we could get SOME sort of acknowledgement whether or not this software is going to be supported. There's bugs in the shaders in the physics in the particle systems in the *fucking* file system in the model importer etc. etc. etc.  They're all logged in the sfm dev forums. Every other forum is spammed with shit not even relevant to the forum (such as ui stuff being posted to every forum thinking people look at them). Two weeks ago every forum was flooded with mmr boosting bot posts. It's actually ridiculous and I doubt anyone looks at the dev forums or even works on the tools at the moment.

Is this really TI? Group stage day 1 criticism,self.DotA2,So I think it's fair to say that apart from Dota itself the first day is fairly disappointing. I have 3 major complaints:  1. Panel. Are we back to 2010 when every tournament is full of waiting screens between games? Panel and analysis and possibly even some filler content has become a pretty standard thing in last few years and this would be embarrassing for every decent tournament and when you consider we are talking about TI that is suppose to push boundaries in production and content? Why did you even hire an amazing host and so many analysts when you use them for less than an hour twice a day. The panel composition is really unbalanced and while I like all 3 analysts on their own together they just don't work because there is no flair added by some talent that's focused more on entertainment than pro analysis. Don't get me wrong I love professional in-depth Dota discussion but you just need to add some more elements to it. People complained about Charlie a lot in the past but someone like him Jack Grant or Pyrion is something that's really missing. Edit: or I'm sure that either Godz or Merlini would help a lot.  2. Technical issues. Casters are about 1 second out of sync compared to a game and in-game sounds. And it's been like that without a fix for at least 5 games. How is that even possible in a tournament this big? Synd had mic problems for quite some time as well I don't know if that's already been fixed. The observer for stream 2 was amateurish and for the majority of the first game they didn't even show stats and didn't react to casters at all - OD and Fogged talking about graphs and observer is completely clueless showing somebody farming woods. I have hard time believing it was either Skrff or Weppas without some technical issues.    3. Water terrain. I guess this is the smallest issue out of those but I think it's really awful choice. Aesthetically it's pretty polarizing terrain and it's overall pretty niche to be put for everybody but the main problem is that TI always brings so many new people that watch just because it's TI and have never played by themselves or stopped playing for a while and for them this must be so confusing. As someone who hates Skywrath looks like Dragon Knight threads this terrain took me about a whole game playing it to really get it. Also those whales sounds.  If this was some other tournament who really cares but this is TI for Christ sake the celebration of Dota and the first day is worse than non-major tournaments.   **Edit:** So that it isn't just complaining but more of something that resembles a constructive criticism I'd suggest:  1. Obviously keep panel throughout the day. Rebalance panelist composition in the way that you have at least two of the more experienced panelists (Godz Merlini Blitz Winter Fogged) + one of the new ones at the begging of the day and maybe more new blood throughout the day when it's more focused on analyzing games.  2. Apart from fixing out of sync audio have the main casters observe the game. It's always been like that in a group stage and it was much much better than this. At least you have the continuity between what is shown and what are they talking about.  3. Use the main terrain for the sake of new players and casual viewers.,complaint

Black didn't have Time Walk,self.DotA2,"casters need to pay more attention holy shit.

It just really annoyed me and I've noticed these errors a lot recently.

Playing solo ranked makes me fucking want to kill myself 80% of games,self.DotA2,Is that normal?  Edit:  Since this post got somehow popular let me clarify on what makes me so mad when playing solo ranked:  Nearly every match is a stomp from either direction but mostly not because one team is just so much better than the other  Most times you lose because one dude doesn't get the role he thinks he's entitled to play and then he starts feeding or even just plays like shit on purpose. And now it doesn't matter if that happens in the enemy team and you win because of that.  So it sucks that you either get a free win because the enemy feeds or that you lose because someone in your team thinks it's more important for him to play his role than just fucking play the game and maybe even win  PS: No i don't want to literally kill myself because of some videogame.,complaint

Everything that is bad about the new drop system.,self.DotA2,"There have been numerous threads about the new system and I would just like to put another one together including all the reasons why a large number of the community is unhappy about the new drop system:  1. **Transparency!** It was much more clearer before when you would get drops. Sure there were some random drops but one thing was for sure you would get an item every time you level up your Dota 2 account. It made people feel like the system is fair so they accepted it. Now no one knows exactly how things work and it's logical that people are upset when they hear stories how some people got a nice item drop and they didn't get anything for months. I know they have no real reason to complain it's a free game and Valve does not have to give them anything but it still makes you feel kind of sad when you hear others got something and you didn't and on top of that you don't even know why because no one knows how things work. It just creates unhappy customers which really doesn't benefit anyone. A system that that is unclear will give birth to rumors and lots of false theories and eventually there will be stupid people who will try to abuse the system based on those rumors we have seen this already happen before...  2. **The level system is useless!** This is quite clear and doesn't need much explaining. It just looks a bit ridiculous and rushed. It makes Valve look silly like they didn't think things true and didn't considered all the factors when they changed the system.   3. **Doesn't motivate new players to get items!** When I first started playing Dota 2 I was already a veteran of DotA and just wanted to enjoy the game that I liked so much. I didn't care about items at all it was just cosmetics for me. Sure I got drops from time to time and used them but it didn't mean anything for me and I never considered buying them. But over time I got more and more items I started playing around with them. I combined items from different sets and started searching for other items to look if there is something that would fit well with those I already have... And before I knew it I got hooked on items and started carrying about them now it's almost a game withing a game for me collecting different items and adding them to my collection. Obviously Valve benefits from such a thing as I started paying money to get the items I wanted. I mostly got drops for items that are not worth much but they got me curious about others and I soon discovered that I wanted the more expensive ones as well because they fit so well with those I have. Now drops are so rare that a lot of newer players won't really care about them. It feels like a random thing that happens way to rare to bother with it.  4. **The thrill of trading is gone!** It used to be that you get a single item drop from a set and now the drops include whole sets. It seams at first like that's better for the person who gets the drop but it takes something away from the game. As mentioned before it was like ""a game withing a game"". You get certain items and you can trade with others or buy at the steam market those that are missing from your set. Such a system was really great for the game as it created a whole community based around traders. Those people moved items around and created an economy withing a game. It created betting sites that revolved around items. All those thing helped promote Dota 2 and make it into something more. It brought more people into it and with them more money. I know people who didn't trade much with items think that does not concern them but it does indirectly impact the game that they play and it helps keep it free. It's not even about making money with trades. Many people who don't trade assume that those who do make lot of money by doing so. That was never the case for me I traded because it felt like a game like playing a trade simulation game only this time it involved real people. Often times I spent hours finding people to trade items with and move them around just to save like 0.5 $. I could have easily afforded to just pay and not waste my time but It was not about the money it was about playing the ""trading"" game and feeling the same thrill as you would by expanding your empire in a trading simulation. Getting whole sets as drops take a big part of that game away...  This are the ones I could come up with at the moment. I will update the list with other things that might come up in the comments....",complaint

Faceit ladder (SF arcana ladder and battle pass) is rigged and no one from faceit is doing a damn thing.,self.DotA2,"This will be a long post and Im posting it the whole community on R/dota2 since i worked really hard on the SF ladder today i want to show everyone how corrupt faceit is and we have to rally to make it better. I didnt drop a single game and won every game and ended up with 74 points. Heres the ladder results https://www.faceit.com/en/dota2/event/d789193c-efd9-45cc-8a13-d8e176fce044  Now as you can see i came in 5th. But as we debunk and take a look at the top 3 players- something is fishy. You click on there profile and they have no games played. You see that ""Chelio-nada"" last game was on the date 6/30 but the ladder was 7/3? He has racked up 124 points. I played the whole ladder never played against him. 124 points is absurd you would have to win aprox 9 games to get that 9 games straight but none of them were recorded. Now taking it logical CHelio-Nada has a 45 percent winrate and on his profile he says hes from Pakistan- playing on useast ladder. Anyway i dont think he can win 9 games straight it just doesnt sound right. Take a look at the other 2 next in line. Voltoo has not even played 1 game if you look on his friends list he has Chelio Nada added. Look at #3 Dam1on and same with him hasnt played a game since 6/30 with an unreasonable amount of points i cant even come close to catching up with.   I debunked it further during the ladder and now i understand why. This stack of 3 people had set up fake accounts to call gg before they get in the game i assume making it so it doesnt show up on their profile. https://www.faceit.com/en/dota2/room/dbe72083-00bc-4ea8-90e5-d428b84e480b  Take a look at all the accounts none of them had played any games on faceit and they seem very fake.  Now we see that the top3 players are obviously cheating and boosting points to get the SF arcana and prizes. They got points very quickly and it was obvious as i check on their lobbies while im searching for a game.  It doesnt end here it keeps rolling rolling rolling.  I take a look at one of Nada's dotabuffs and hes used to this as a couple games slipped through here. http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2473143511 If this isnt obvious i dont know what is.   Now our next on the ladder one up from me is Benito- hes made it much much less obvious but he has found a way. he ended with 79 points. I beat him in the last game to put him down by 12 too and here is the game. https://www.faceit.com/en/dota2/room/83a33476-2edf-4d40-966f-5307a206e857  Now that game was the last game of the ladder before it was played he jumped by a quick 20 points as i refreshed the page so i thought oh man another abuser. Its annoying and frustrating at this point. So ill take it logically here- i dont have much proof but it will make sense.   When you lose a faceit ladder game you lose points but never drop below 0. Benito went 5-2 i went 6-0 and BEAT him. Somehow he ended up with more points and like i said he jumped by about 20 before i even played him. I truly think he got more points by just doing the same as Nada and making fake accounts. It was towards the end of the ladder as he seemed to do it fair before then.   Im just about done proving everything i played the ladder fair and won it but cheaters are holding it back.  Im going to talk about faceit and its role in all this. This isnt new. I lost a ladder a few days ago to the same Nada guy and this happens every single day. Faceit stands around nothing to be done said or worried about. They give all those faceit points to Nada who can get all the prizes he wants and everything without even playing a single game. I talked to many live support people made tickets that were never answered and tried my best then i realised.  Faceit is very corrupt and broken. They dont do anything to solve it and the cheaters keep doing this day by day. EVERY time. They told me 2 days ago that they review the ladder before they give the points. Which is utter bull at this point since Nada wins every day with his stack. The system is broken and i cant express that more.   Here is something to add ive seen on their site. You cant see ANY past faceit ladders without a link and the match lobbies are none to be found. I dont see it and ive had to keep the link. They are hiding it and rigging to make a profit. Unbelieveable.  We filed many reports and this is 1 of the many tickets https://support.faceit.com/hc/en-us/requests/16700?page=1 I talked to live support over and over and they say it will be fixed when it never is.  If nothing gets done and they dont put the real winners of the ladders i quit faceit forever. They dont seem to care one bit. I played for about EIGHT hours straight and won every game and played hard good dota im punished instead of rewarded. Something is wrong.  Thanks for reading this if youve gotten this far. Its the longest post ever but it needs to be addressed to the whole community. ",complaint

Don't get unrealistic expectations r/doto,self.DotA2,I hate to be that guy. I really do. But I predict a lot of butthurt over the next few days. Some people are already dissatisfied with the year beast event and whatever else I personally don't mind but there could be worse to come.      Now I wouldn't be surprised if the outcome of the offerings disappointed many people and on top of that I'd be INCREDIBLY surprised if they released a new hero in the form of Sun Wukong right after two heroes and before full hero parity with dota 1. Yet the general consensus on this sub is that the offering *better* be good and volvo will *obviously* release a new hero. For real? After all the content thats come in the last two weeks? I'd be unhappy to see rage all over the community by the end of the event so please appreciate what we've received already.

FPS drops are getting worse and worse. A lot of people can't play the game.,self.DotA2,**UPDATE**  According to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2g1v04/try_unequipping_global_items_in_your_loadout_to/) thread I just tried unequipping all cosmetics from Global Items and I did get about 5-10 FPS more (still stutters a bit though). Also if I bring Vsync back it's still unplayable.  ---  I'm really sorry for bringing this up again. I and a lot of other people can't play the game so this is one of the things when I'm trying to do something about it. After numerous threads on Dota2 Dev forum for the past month no one from their staff replied. The last time this kind of thread hit the front page on this subreddit was on weekend and it disappeared from it pretty much when Monday started so maybe no one from Valve bothered to check Reddit during weekend (this is just a guess of desperation) but I know they do check this subreddit sometimes so I hope it'll hit the front page again but this time during work days. Again I am sorry for bringing this up again and thank you for understanding frustrations from us who cannot play anymore.  So here it goes...  ---  The first time many of us experienced drastic FPS drops (in my case from 60 to a very noticeable 20) about 3-4 weeks ago after major **Steam Client update** my fix at the time was to turn off Vsync. After turning it off I got my FPS back to a constant 60 just like it used to be (but still I got screen tearing now). However after Techies update it dropped to 30-40. Before these FPS drops I had everything checked and maxed in video settings with loaded weather effects and it never dropped below 60 FPS.  Anyone else experiencing worse and worse FPS drops over time especially now? Know that game has gotten **unplayable BEFORE Techies update** after the last major Steam Client update. Techies update just made it a lil' more worse but I think it might not be the root of the problem.  After the last major Steam Client update a lot of people noticed several instances (six or more) of steamwebhelper.exe process running. It seems that many people can completely resolve these drastic FPS drops by shutting down all instances of this process. In my case however if I end any of its instances another instance of this process immediately starts. If I remove steamwebhelper.exe from C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\bin Steam Client gets updated on the next start and it brings it back mysteriously hogging up resources while Dota 2 is running.  Some suspect that this problem has something to do with new **Steam Overlay**. I turned it off and didn't notice any difference.  As for my digital hygiene I'd say I keep it pretty neat most of the time usually keeping only Skype in taskbar and toolbar beside Steam Client while playing Dota. Antivirus can run scans only manually and I tend to check up on background processes quite often which aren't that many compared to some average end user's machine.  My other games such as Skyrim Warframe and Mirror's Edge run just fine on high settings.  ---  Please post your system specs if you're having this issue.

After 4400 games I literally dreamed about a Dota 2 match last night: It had a feeder in it and I woke up because I was too angry to continue sleeping. VOLVO FIX YOUR REPORT SYSTEM.,self.DotA2,"For the first time in my life I dreamed about a Dota match last night and I woke up because I was too enraged to continue sleeping. If this sorry excuse of a report/punishment-system rustles my jimmies even during sleep then I think we need to talk.     - - -   **Some background info:** I've been playing DotA on and off since 2004/2005 during the WC3 TFT days I used platforms like dotapickup to keep my games free of leavers and obvious griefers. Thanks to tools like listchecker and banlist it (more or less) worked. I was glad that people hosted pickup platforms and leagues for dota so you can play without all the griefers and leavers. Back in November 2011 when i received my invite to the dota2 beta it felt like christmas. My favorite mod gets picked up by Valve and gets rid of all the hassle we had to endure while setting up games privately. No more listchecker no more banlists to keep updated proper servers and a reconnect feature. Glorious!   Yet still **6 years later I'm literally getting nightmares** even when not ""actively"" playing Dota 2 because I'm too frustrated by how the game handles reports and punishing players. I've racked up about [4400 matches](http://imgur.com/yU7Xm8j) of dota in those 6 years for some reason people commended me [614 times](http://imgur.com/urtVCtk) so far (I never asked/swapped commends) and my behaviour score sits currently [at 9887](http://imgur.com/FJjb6fS). I haven't been muted nor sent to low-prio even once in my lifetime. It's safe to say that it's extremely hard to get me somewhat tilted during a match because I focus on winning and having fun not the occasional griefers. I'm hovering around 4.3 to 4.5k MMR while randoming and playing support/offlane most of the time.  - - -   In my 13 years of dota I've seen everything from the usual 30 min afk jungler to the typical ragekids deepthroating their mic while blasting your eardrums. The classic ""dunning kruger""-cores as well as the ""I don't know what I'm doing""-supports. But I don't care about bad players or even normal players having a bad game. What really pisses me off the most is that **this community can't get rid of the obvious bad apples** because we don't have the tools to punish them **efficiently** (and this sometimes means: **permanently**). During the last months I've mostly played TI ranked and was appalled when I realized that smurf low-level accounts can bypass the normal restrictions of ranked matchmaking by purchasing the battlepass.   Due to this circumstance I've experienced some of the worst matches of my dota lifetime. The worst part of it: 75% of the time I can't even report the offenders because I've already used up my ""chances"" for the week even though I only report heavy insufferable offenders. It's probably been a year since I last reported someone for chat abuse/toxic behavior because I know that those reports go straight to the trash bin and minimize my chances to ""punish"" the real griefers. Meanwhile the real game ruiners roam free while the people trying to report them are greeted by the almost gleeful [""welcoming new players"" banner ad](http://imgur.com/NGcg5d0) right after having to endure 30-60 minutes of absolute time-wasting due to excessive griefing and feeding.   It's [games like these](https://www.opendota.com/matches/3382987723/overview) when you lose all faith in the report/punishment system because the offenders (furion/invoker both wanting mid furion therefore tps to the enemy base and starts feeding wards/courier/heroes while mouthbreathing into his mic and laughing) won't ever experience repercussions for wasting the time of all other players. And if you want to report the offenders you'll have to endure the game however long the griefer forces you to stay because otherwise you can't even check if you've still got an opportunity to report him...or you're out of reports for the week and have to shrug it off. It's infuriatingly bad and I can't even fathom why after six years of Dota 2 being on the market we don't have a proper way to get rid of toxic intentionally malicious players in our games. You've enforced a phone-number registration for ranked games so start banning malicious griefers / feeders / intentional game ruiners already. Don't reward them with a cheap ""solution"" (TI ranked) for their smurfs but instead fucking also ban the smurf-accounts. We know VAC can identify and ban multiple accounts connected to the same cheater why not do the same for malicious griefers?  - - -  TLDR / plead for sanity:  **Valve please fix the report/punishment-system.** It's ridiculous to even think about bringing in new players to this game when the old ones can't even properly defend themselves against malicious griefing and game ruining. I'm sick of wasting my time because we don't have an Overwatch-System like in CS:GO to manually weed out the black sheep of the community. The current ""punishment"" of putting people into low-prio clearly doesn't work (due to rampant botting/the LP mechanics and its ""success"" conditions). To one-up this already broken mess: most of the time in ranked games offenders can't even get reported by their victims because they haven't been allotted enough tickets to report someone. It's a complete farce and all it does is drive off the ""socially adjusted"" players while leaving the worst behaving ones untouched to roam free and harass everyone. It's sickening and literally gives me nightmares.  Thank you for reading.   - - -   TLDR^2: **Dota 2 Report/Punishment-System ~~gave me literal nightmare~~ made me ragequit my nightmare.

"Can we stop this ""the game is dying"" mentality",self.DotA2,I get that we are losing palyers and Dota has alot of issues. But constantly repeating that the game is dying wont do any good to that.

So dont turn this into a self fullfilling prophecy.  Edit: to clarify my point.

We need to remind valve that the 3 month market delay is NOT ok.,self.DotA2,This topic seems to have been somewhat ignored over the past couple of weeks. But this business model from valve is beginning to move towards the 'league of legends' tier of bullshit.  8 months ago the ACCC (Australian competition and consumer commission) actually put forward the bill to BAN valve from conducting business in Australia.   Now this wasn't because of this item delay topic it was about  Steam's digital licensing of video games however this item sale delay also breaks 3 clauses in the ACCC's fair sale laws and I'm sure we are not the only country that has laws against this in order to protect consumers.   (https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/full-steam-ahead-accc-institutes-proceedings-against-valve-for-making-alleged-misleading-consumer-guarantee-representations) for reference there is the article in question.   It is unacceptable that something that WE purchase should be unable to be sold or returned. Now obviously this differs to tangible goods in the real world however the law DOES NOT EXEMPT ONLINE GOODS. This is definitely against consumer law in Australia I assume it is also illegal in other countries.  As a community we need to show Valve that this method of conducting their business is NOT fair and that we will NOT support it.  /rage.,complaint

Just faced a scripting Storm player,self.DotA2,"[Here's the match](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1604327300) in question. Basically there are multiple times where I blinked onto this guy and he instantly silences. The axe player noticed the same thing too.

Another point of view,self.DotA2,I have to be absolutely honest: I am foreseeing the downvotes but I need to vent.  HOW CAN YOU PEOPLE PLAY A GAME AS COMPLEX AS DOTA? You get confused by anything! A slight cosmetic change on a hero : OMG CANT RECOGNIZE PLEASE FIX  A new skin on a courier? CONFUSED WITH GYRO MISSILE HALP.  Seriously I don't get it. I never once confused anything with anything else in this game and I am no one special.   I wonder how you even manage to understand anything than is going on in this game. Do you really need a big red arrow pointing couriers being all like HELLO I AM COURIER!  Some people like me love cosmetics. I love them because they let me and other people customize their characters the way they want them to be the way they enjoy it the most. I don't get why we should not be able to do it only because THE FIRST TIME YOU ENCOUNTER IT it might confuse you ONCE. I mean if you don't learn after seeing it once you have a serious problem. Its not as if every single game you play has a million dollar on the line or the fact than you MIGHT be confused for a second during the laning phase will cause you to lose the whole game.   Seriously? I am sick of hearing people crying over and over again about cosmetics and  I hope both valve and the community creators will actually take us who enjoy those changes in balance also. I feel like we are not vocal enough.  I might not have took the best approach but really its infuriating me than every time a new cosmetic gets added all I hear is bitch and moan and bitch and moan.  EDIT: To make it clear I agree than Valve should add a no cosmetic option simply for those of you who struggle with cosmetics. HOWEVER as long as this function is not added I am 100% siding for cosmetics. ,complaint

I'm tired.,self.DotA2,I have almost 6000 hours logged in Dota 2 and would love to keep playing but I can't.   I'll get straight to the point. I am not a psychologist. I am not a babysitter either. I am a 24 year old man who wants to enjoy his favorite game meeting friendly people fighting for a common goal. Sometimes we succeed sometimes we fail. At the end of the day it's all good fun. This is where the tired bit comes in from the title. I'm tired of having to be someones emotional target. I'm tired of being the backbone for an angry team. I'm tired of the fact that this is OK.  I have [a perfect behavior score.](http://imgur.com/Rw7tZFL) I've had that score for years and I'm tired. The emotionally unstable and angry people who ruin this game for the diehard fans who have invested so much time and money into the game they love seem to always get away without any consequences. Getting a few low prio games is a consequence of being a bad person to your fellow players. There is no consequence for going above and beyond that and being a consistently horrible person.  I will not be spending any more money on this game. I will not be playing this game without being invited on by my friends.

The Tome of Knowledge icon could be brighter. All the other items are well-lit but Tome's so dark it always looks out-of-stock.,self.DotA2,"Just look at this lineup of nicely stocked items: http://i.imgur.com/0JYL8QW.png  See how they're all nicely lit up?  Everything looks like it has a spotlight placed on it so they kinda pop out at you.  Then there's the Tome of Knowledge.   **Is it on cooldown in this image?** http://i.imgur.com/XPqk4R1.png  If you had to think for any more than a second then the entire purpose of the cooldown dimming isn't doing its job.  In actuality it's out of stock and for another minute and a half at that but it's not that easy to tell is it?  It's like all the other items in the game were put on display and photographed in a bright light but on Tome's picture day all they had on hand were candles.  It'd be really handy if either the tome got a better background that's easy to see the contrast of the stock timer with *like literally every other old item with a cooldown* or the cooldown dimming got a better effect that made it more visible.    You may wonder ""well why is this even important just check for multiples of 10 on the timer"" - If it ever fully stocks to 3 it stops restocking and that multiples of 10 never works for the rest of the match just like with wards gem and smoke.  Ideally this never happens.  It does anyway.",complaint
Siltbreaker isn't fun after this update. Here is why.,self.DotA2,Im sorry Valve it just isn't fun at all because this recent update introduces grinding.    The artifacts already had level requirements prior to this update if you decided that the artifacts were too good why not just increase their level requirements?    EDIT: OR Nerf their stats?   Why introduce a grinding system that requires players to spend 2-3 games trying to do the game on a handicap so that they can do the 30 star runs with full artifacts?    As a working adult in his 20s I only have 1-2 hours a weekday and 3-4 hours a weekend to play Dota 2.   Previously Siltbreaker Act 1 was ok because each game was like a fresh new game of Dota 2 everyone goes in there on the same skill level and the entirety of the game is concluded upon game end.    Right now its like some MMO bullshit where players have to farm tokens so that they can actually easily do Siltbreaker.    As a working adult I find it extremely tedious and boring to spend time grinding. I might as well just play normal games.    Remove the stupid coin system. It serves no purpose except to encourage grind.  u/GeminiDNK [summarises it well here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6unqdl/siltbreaker_isnt_fun_after_this_update_here_is_why/dlucoud/),complaint

Dota 2 modding is dead,self.DotA2,Congratulations Valve you killed dota modding  Over the time that dota 2 modding has been a thing a lot of great mods have been created that take tons of work are polished and are different from dota which in my opinion is important for a mod. Think of mods like Element TD Roshpit Champions Crumbling Island Arena. It is not a coincidence these mods all have passes. Now look at the top 10 list in the arcade where are these mods?  The arcade UI has been the topic of a lot of debate on this reddit and I think it is partially to blame although the larger audience here does not seem to understand that the top 10 is a RESULT of these mods popularity not the cause. Everyone here can say other mods have little chance which is partially true but at the end of the day the mods that are in the top 10 are the mods with the largest community and playerbase.  These top 10 mods are what we refer to as dota-like mods as they use the default (maybe modified a little) dota heroes and are generally just very similar to how you play dota. The fact of the matter is that the mod-playing players out there want dota-likes anything else will have to struggle for players. I have seen this impact the modding community greatly. Creators of very creative fun mods have been giving up because they realise their mods stand no chance against these dota-likes without extra promotion.  What valve should be doing is promoting these different mods because the dota-like mods get plenty of players already. This week a new dota-like comes out Trials of Retribution that makes a big splash. From a modding point of view the mod has no creativity (dota with 2 more teams) and is extremely buggy (backdoor protection not working looking at their code its frankly a miracle anything works at all). This mod gets dedicated servers within 3 hours of releasing it gets a ridiculous playercount and even an email from [valve congratulating them on the fun mod](https://moddota.com/uploads/valveemail.png). This is another middle finger to other modders since valve has traditionally been very hard to communicate with even for pass owners.  Now I have nothing against the TOR creators I encourage them modding and like to see the modding scene grow. Imagine the other mod makers however that spend days and days polishing their mods struggling to find workarounds to problems they have because their mod is different. Imagine how this makes them feel. Just today I have seen multiple people say they might as well quit modding because there is no point anyway. What is worse is that these are the creators of really creative mods and mostly the people with knowledge and experience. As these people leave the scene the quality of mods will dramatically go down since we do not only hang out in the irc we also use it to teach new modders. If there are no more teachers this community will stagnate it already has.  The creator of Element TD Pimp my Peon and more has already left the scene the creator of barebones the framework most mods run on has left the scene. The creator of legends of dota has left. I see creators of other big mods wonder if this is worth it (yes even pass holders). I see new modders working on their mods give up because they can never compete.  So how could this situation be fixed? This is a complex situation and there is no straightforward answers. Things would improve the situation: Work on promoting non-dota-like custom games Even if you guys dont care about the arcade it is not fair to keep the modding community on the line: communicate your plans to us. Try communicating with the modding community since the death of dev.dota2 we have been unable to ask questions report bugs or request features effectively. (A system like stackexchange would be very effective for this imo)  Its up to you valve act now or lose your modding scene.  Regards a disappointed ex-modder.  TL;DR: The current modding environment is extremely discouraging to creative modders and will kill the modding community if unchanged. ,complaint

VALVE please address the FPS drop issues which started after the 6.86 update.,self.DotA2,I used to run Dota 2 on highest settings possible before the patch and never observed FPS drop ever. But after this patch i cant run DOTA 2 on highest settings anymore. If i run it on highest settings with Vsync off all i will get is 20-30 fps. I had to turn off Anti Aliasing Ambient Occlusion and World Lighting and lower down texture quality to high from ultra to get 45-60 fps. I have tried every possible troubleshooting such as- --Using console commands such - gl  -nod3d9ex --Put engine_no_focus_sleep 0 to your autoexec / console --Switch from exclusive fullscreen to borderless windowed. --Set fps_max in console to 120 --Turn off the VSync --Check your autoexec / config for mat_vsync 1 if you find it change the value to 0. --Disable Vsync completely from your GPU driver panel   And just for information my machine not  potato it has Nvidia GTX 750 ti  8 GB RAM and all. It runs games like GTA V without any FPS drop or issues so this is definitely Dota problem which got introduced in recent patches. One more thing that i noticed that ALT+TAB actually fixes the FPS for few seconds and then it again drops Relaunching the game also works but only for few minutes.

[This](https://support.steampowered.com/kb/8799-WLXN-3860/dota-2-workshop-wards) are Valve's requirements for submitting ward models to the workshop if anyone is interested.

It never happened. According to his original post:  >3 were players who had played regularly since wc dota with mmr's of 4.3k 4.6k and 4.7k **none of which had ever played below 3k mmr**  >The other 2 were both relatively new one started playing around shanghai last year and the other a few months before that **their mmr's at the time were 2.4 and 2.1**  But he also said this 2 days ago:  >The 2.5-3.5k bracket is the hardest mmr range to climb through as the skill diversity is just huge and sometimes you truly have to put the whole game on your shoulders to pull out a win. However it isn't impossible but your really going to have to be hard on yourself and truly concentrate and be aware of your decisions. **I calibrated at 1.6k and am now at 4.7k** most of my friends were dota 1 players and calibrated at 4k+ and I can GUARANTEE you that very few of them would be good enough to start at a lower mmr and climb back to their current mmrs. Dota at lower mmr levels is almost like a whole different game and you'll have to learn this and use it to your advantage.  And more earlier  >**Usually in my tier (high 2k)** the odds of the enemy having tp's and detection and be the right hero to stop me pushing the tower are pretty low  >**So I play carry in low 3k** and the biggest uncertainty I have In my games right now is knowing when to farm and when to fight.

I would honestly have probably agreed to it if I were to get proper credit but this... This is just plagiarism.  Yeah I commented on the video but we all know how that goes. I'll get a sorry or something and that's it.  To put in words why I'm so upset - this guide took quite a while to come up with write and publish in a nice format.

Valve it's time for some much needed features and community reform.,self.DotA2,"I've never been good at introductions but I think it's time we see some real changes to help Dota grow. Valve has shown that it wants to start promoting the game and adding features to help attract and hook new players which is really great but what really prompted me to make this thread is the sudden increase in the number of threads regarding toxicity in games and the community in general. Dota's player base has also been quite stagnant for years now and the top reasons new players quit is due to experiencing smurfing and toxicity in games this is further worsened by a insufficient tutorial which doesn't provide the necessary tools for newbs to succeed.  This thread is solely to address issues within the community that I and many others have experienced. Here are my ideas to help remedy this and make Dota a more pleasant experience in all of this. Please note that these changes do not aim to remove in game systems but are additions or expansions to existing ones. (The exception to this is in regards to the arcade)  #REWARD GOOD BEHAVIOUR The first step is promote good behaviour and reward players for being friendly and teaching to others. It's been proven that positive reinforcement can do wonders and can really improve a person's attitude and performance so if there were a system implemented that allowed players to be rewarded for being good people this would greatly improve the overall atmosphere in game. First off **commending needs to be encouraged more often** it's not uncommon that we simply forget to commend someone with found enjoyable or friendly in a match but we almost never forget to report a annoying or unpleasant player.. A good method is to have a screen at the end of a match that's dedicated to commending which would be seen before the regular score screen. For rewards they can range from** actual rewards** such as a chest an exclusive item special terrain skin or a set which the chance of receiving would justify for many players the extra effort it can be to be more forgiving and understanding. The next method and what I believe to be the most important/effective is to give players that have been exceedingly good something to show off. Why? Because **Dota player's love to brag** and what better way to promote good behaviour than to grant a temporary badge of honour to make it real clear who's **better than the rest of us**.  #MORE REASONS TO PLAY Dota is a incredibly stressful and emotion game to play but have you ever wondered why? It's because **winning is everything**. Everything about Dota creates the expectation that you should be trying to win every game that you play so much so that even in the games that you have no control over **you feel like a loser** and it's because you have failed every win condition in or outside the game. What I'd propose is a way to soften the blow of losing and to add more ways to ""win"" at Dota. Loot creates set collecting in game currency farming commends quests achievements are all common themes in other multiplayer games and can create a much more casual experience for those who aren't interested in tri-harding spamming ranked and gaining MMR. Make it so even if you lose you still gain something acknowledge the fact that **Dota is an incredibly emotional game** and do something about it. Now for the big one and this will lead into my next idea add more ways to ""win"". **Tournaments In-House leagues guilds clans and the arcade**. Having more player goals to work towards is real important to decreasing stress and frustration after a loss because it gives other reasons and goals to work toward which aren't completely defeated when losing a match.  #REDUCE ANONYMITY INCREASE COMMUNITY AND BELONGING The current Dota promotes to much individualism solo queue being the only MMR that matters and there being almost no way to interact with your fellow players creates even more anonymity compared to a standard internet community and is further promoted by the ability to change your name any time and to anything. By giving people a concrete community to belong to you can reduce the amount players act as if nothing matters by allowing them to develop their own reputations and friends amongst community groups. My suggestion to implement guilds clans and groups but before I go into this topic I'd also like to explain why guilds and clans failed in Source 1 and it's because there was no reason to create one there was no way to interact directly with clan/guild mates and there was nothing to give clan/guild members a sense of belonging. Here's how to make it work in various stages:  * First idea is to give **tournament organisers and broadcast studios the ability to create tournament pages and groups** so that people can subscribe them promoting this and implementing into the client is very important. This allows the tournament organiser/studio to **notify their members** on steam on your phone on your twitch when a match they are hosting has started allows members to chat with each other before during and after a game. Also this give tournaments and studios a means to directly communicate with their audiences. **Allow these groups to moderate themselves** this is very important because Valve I know how you hate interacting with the community.  * Secondly give **Teams the ability to create their own** pages and groups for the same reasons. Allow them to promote themselves do giveaways notify their fans of upcoming games and host a place of discussion before during and after a game. Give an option to merge chat channels so that tournament organisers studios and teams and interact together.   * Next is to allow users to form their own groups. This will be mainly for people who have a big following to have their own dota following people such as AdmiralBulldog Purge Day[9] GrandGrant BurNing Dendi a place for their fan base to talk with each other and be notified when they're streaming playing if they've join a new team uploaded a new video. Also allow them to moderate themselves.  * **In-house Leagues** come now allow every group to host their own In-house League many of you have seen how **successful FPL** was/is and I'm sure the top players enjoyed it immensely. Anonymity is both the greatest strength and weakness of the internet it not only allow you to escape but also allows people to incredibly toxic to others because they have their true identities hidden. This solves 2 problems playing with randoms you don't know and have no connection with and top level players being queued for unreasonable amounts of time. I suggest groups that host in-house games have rules that their users either have to use their pro names or not be able to change their name after joining or even have it shown in brackets next their current name.  * Teams/Squads and **Regular Tournaments with no pay wall**. This is for players that want to play the more competitive side of dota have the ability to create teams that are not qualified to enter minors or majors but can enter weekly tournaments for small prizes or just tournament wins and profile borders/stats. This **separate to Battle Cup** where it's seasonal requires a ticket and also provides better rewards. Have groups also be able to host their own tournaments either in themselves or against other groups this is to spark community interaction and rivalry amongst bigger groups. **Teams should have results prizes and ranks tied to the team** to discourage players from endless creating useless teams.  * Last suggestion is for **Arcade/Community Workshop groups.** Groups that are dedicated to a arcade game or a workshop developer give these guys a way of building their own followings like they did in Warcraft 3. Have groups especially for workshop development and tutorials. This will also require a rework of the current arcade it's a disaster you can't even play as a party without each individual person finding the game and downloading it like at least give each player in the party a prompt to download it.  To reiterate the important points allow users the ability to **create groups inside the Dota client** so that they they can **receive notifications** about matches streams new videos etc. Allow for the **creation and hosting of in house leagues** inside the client so that players can play games with a group of people they are more familiar with. **Host Regular tournaments** to provide for players looking for a more competitive experience. Allow these **communities to customise and moderate themselves** set their own rules and requirements for joining private of public. This will not only decrease the workload on your end Valve but allow these groups to be more personal and niche. **Promote and support these features to come community and a sense of belonging are what keeps players here even if the game doesn't.**   #THE ARCADE This could be Dota's strongest feature very few games have good mod support and Valve you may just find your next winner from this. Starcraft and Warcraft were all wildly successful thanks to their great mod support and 3 of your most popular games were previously mods I think it's time to pay some respect to this portion of Dota 2. From the player perspective the arcade and custom game section has always been a part of the game to unwind and find something new to relieve some of the tension from regular Dota even Starcraft 2's arcade which was considered a disaster is still a popular place players go to for some time to kill. The arcade unlimited potential and can also be used to help new players to Dota user submitted tutorials or using custom maps as a means to get used to basic mechanics and controls. The biggest problems of the arcade right now are that:   * **It doesn't work** The lobby doesn't allow you to kick players that are afk select colour position race role you can't play a new game as a party without having each party member finding the game and individually downloading it and every game bar the top 10 - 20 are dead. In Warcraft 3 there was no list of popular games there was only open lobby and the list of games was only sorted by genre and came from sites like epicwar and hiveworkshop (which also had most popular but was defaulted as what's new).  * **It's hidden** currently the arcade is hidden away behind a tab. A unsorted list of open lobbies (for your region/ping) should just appear on the front page as a panel and if you wish to browse or host your own game you can go to the arcade tab. In my opinion the list should only include minimal information such as thumbnail game name game type and host name but do not include number of players to allow lobbies to fill up more evenly and naturally. This is to promote and keep the idea of the arcade in everyone's mind and make it feel like the arcade is as important as the main game.  * **Provided resources for developers** I just feel as if the number of doodads props and tile sets Valve provides to workshop artists is very little and makes making games much to timely. In Warcraft 3 many of the best games and classics used the default models and tile sets provided by the game itself and it was only after many years that games with many custom models and tile sets appeared but only after there were a huge variety of games to play many of which were modified melee maps. Edit: This may be of an issue of the editor being too difficult to use rather than a lack of provided materials. In which case an easier more user friendly should be developed similar to the wc3 editor.  * **Unit Control** Valve just copy like Starcraft or Warcraft for this part the current HUD and Unit control systems just don't allow for good unit control meaning games which only allow you to use one character are the only things worth even considering.  * **The arcade should be part of the tutorial**. Using custom maps to allow players get used to different game play mechanics such as cast times turn rates fog of war. Adding challenge and verse modes for each of the scenarios would be such a fun way to learn Dota. Most importantly these mini games should point to the arcade as a means to find alternative versions or other fun mini games.  #PROS HAVE TO BE MADE ACCOUNTABLE **Pros represent the game and the community** so anything they do that promotes shitty and toxic behaviour has to be punishable. I'm **NOT** talking about the occasional and rare instances of toxicity caused by shitty moods or accidents but rather **extreme and regular instances** of flaming abandoning intentional feeding doxxing stream sniping raiding is **NOT OK**. The outside world is peering into your home at least pretend to have it be clean and inviting. Note: When talking about pros I'm talking streamers tournament attendees Youtubers studios casters anyone and everyone who has a larger than normal public image.   Edit: This was not my strongest point you guys have made it quite clear. I'm not asking pro's to become community role models but I do still believe that Valve should at least be a little more strict toward these individuals. This is probably most popular topic of discussion as it's the only one that people have actually replied for both sides rather than disliking it for the sake of it.  #A WALL FOR SMURFS The current barrier for entry is incredibly low which is seemingly great for new players but is ruined due to rampant smurfing. It's important to decide **which features of Dota new players can make use of**. New players should be at least required to play multiple ~~bot~~ co-op vs ai games **on and against** a **limited hero pool** before versing **players of their level** told about hotkeys and basics of RTS such as multiple unit control. **Having all the heroes at your disposal is great for experienced player but is useless to new players** which should only be playing 1 or 2 heroes at the most whilst they get a grasp of the game. A lesson from League of legends which I know mentioning is taboo but they have a much less rampant smurfing at the really low level because there is such a large wall between starting from scratch and having all the features unlocked that most experienced players would rather pay for level 30 accounts instead of levelling a new ones from scratch. I don't have any concrete suggestions for this part but I highly recommend baring the most prominent but most useless features of Dota 2 for new accounts to reduce smurfing.  > To clarify the main idea is to identify the main aspects of dota which are considered core. Identify which of these are unimportant to players that are just starting or learning the game. And introducing these concepts slow enough that it becomes unappealing for experienced players to want to make an account and playing through this process which would otherwise go unnoticed by a truly new player. League does this by slowly unlocking summoner spells giving talent points and unlocking runes over 30 levels which is like 100+ games. This process is considered progression by newer players and isn't annoying. Experienced players however would rather not go through this process because it takes ages and isn't worth being able to Smurf. Although it doesn't remove everyone it reduces the number of Smurfs enough that it isn't really noticed by new players and the majority of Smurfs lie at level 30 from bought accounts or play which is way beyond what a brand new player would encounter. Note how it doesn't remove Smurf from the game just reduces the chance of a new player encountering one which is the point.  #FOR THE NEXT GENERATION This game lives off its player base this game lives and dies with the players. I suggest creating a coaching program for new players this program would **involve a experienced player with a good behaviour record to volunteer** and coach a new player 1 on 1 for their first 5 - 10 games. This is to help new players get a grasp on the game from someone who is experienced yet also promotes positive attitude and condemns poor behaviour and sportsmanship. These **volunteers will of course be rewarded** for their time and if the player they **coached sticks around** for say 50 games. Rewards can be similar or even more exclusive than good behaviour rewards stated above and of course a nice badge for some bragging rights. Adding mini games and challenge scenarios for core mechanics may also be strong method of introducing Dota to players which are interested but feel they aren't ready for a real match. Valve has shown it isn't above using user submitted content as main selling points in games and using arcade features to expand the tutorial and join the arcade and Dota communities together is a win-win scenario.  #TO THE COMMUNITY This is still up to you guys you can really make this place much better and more welcoming. I know there a many of you that that have been around for ages and love this game. So keep do your part in condemning toxicity but more importantly promote the creation art work and community interaction good play commend and add nice and kind people (a friend request goes a long way and is worth even more than a commend) and remember this a game just try have fun.  #TO VALVE You've recreated my favourite game of all time and have continued to support it and although I haven't agreed with every approach you took and I've wizened up to your increasing greed over the years I'm still eternally thankful. You know full well how important it is to grow the player base of a free game just think of the millions you can make with the millions of new players that join. I just hope you make the right decisions whatever they may be and bring Dota and it's community to new heights.  Edit 1: Added clarification to The Wall for Smurfs Sections.  Edit 2: The majority of you guys agree that Pro's should not be made role models and should act and punished as if they are normal players.  Edit 3: Thanks for my first gold and reddit silver /s  Edit 4: I've read essentially every reply so far but i gots to sleep. Remember --> **community** <-- use it solve our problems.  Edit 5: In the wall for Smurfs section I do mean coop vs ai matches not bot matches. A few of you are quite opposed to limiting the hero pool for new players although my actual suggestions for this part aren't weren't meant to be concrete I still think it would do less harm then good but the main way of teaching newbs is through coaching and enhanced tutorial.",suggestion

UI is getting better and better but we still miss these things.,self.DotA2,"* ""Learn ability"" hotkey option I don't know why you would remove options we had for so long when it's just a hotkey. (Alot of people are writing that you can ctrl-hotkey to level up. I know this but I hate to use the ctrl button Ctrl-Q for example feels so awkward)   * Learn talent hotkey. One hotkey to bring up the talent tree and then 2 more hotkeys one for left talent skill and one for the right.  * (New suggestion from comments about how you could skill talents) rather said if it worked like the chat wheel and the screen was split down the middle and you hover left or right could be good  * Bring hp/mana bars above the skills placing them at the very bottom of the screen is really annoying.  * Last hits KDA to be shown at all times. I promise you Dota 2 viewer count on twitch will decrease if this is not fixed. The players stream. It's really boring to watch a stream if you can't see their score last hits etc.   * Give a better XP bar not one who is in a circle also would be good to show the numbers without pressing alt.  * Option to turn of the new sound when something happens in the game kills towers etc.  * Move the gold to be closer to the center of the screen you can add the quickbuy things to the very bottom and put gold + courier usage above it. Let the gold be to the left and courier to the right (now gold is to the right)  * Add hotkey to ""take backpack items"" just like we have for ""take stash items""  * Buff/debuff icons. Right now they just sort of float around above the control console and the UI breaks if there's more than 6 of them. They need to be left aligned and tightly spaced together. (hamataro suggestion) - Also maybe put a timer inside the icon (like normal spells) or above the buff icons to see how long a buff/debuff has left it would make things much more clearer. Rather than only having that circle ""cooling off""  * Here is a suggestion for a better HUD (superm4nkumar suggestion): http://i.imgur.com/NgxtCx3.jpg  * The AVG mmr is still bugged to -1  * Range indicator is broken for some spells like tinkers March of the Machine  * The Confirm button when you random doesn't work  * Let us have both the normal shop and the customized open at the same time like we did before. Or atleast let us a prefered show that should be shown every game now we always have to change if we want the normal shop in every game. -- A way to default to the shop and not the guide/recommended would be nice (better explained)  * Put a timer when the item is transfered from backpack to inventory to see how long is left until we can use it  * ANOTHER BUG: ""Minimap draw on right side"" needs to be reselected every game now in the configurations. Also the UI is weirder with option now considering the UI for Death info runes enemies info etc.  * Also like to see damage and armour values changed back to (a) + (b) instead of just an overall value as it is now without having to pres alt. Same goes for damage   * Shop hotkeys are not working currently at all  *  Would maybe even suggest moving the scan/glyph to above the map that way sponsor overlays and stuff can still fit.  * You have to scroll across again on the post-game scoreboard to see MMR change!  * Skill/Item tooltip should have a slightly longer delay as it will show up briefly when you edge pan downwards.  * health / mana bar background should be less saturated(black?) so you could see the length of the bar with your peripheral vision more easily.  * If you press your shop hotkey while being close to the laneshop or secret shop. Fix so only the items from that shop is available rather than opening the normal shop and having the items that are available highlighted.   * Still missing icons above hero when ""broken"" or ""muted"".  * And also missing icon above someone hit with ""frostbite"" showing the ""disarm"".  * When you buy something while dead (and with free slots) for it goes in the stash instead of immediately moving to the inventory.  * Also add the option to keep the health bar and mp bar green and blue respectively when you play in colorblind mode.  * Is no longer possible to see breakdowns of enemy resistances to know things like when an AM has skilled mana sheild. I don't think that it would be intentional. (By Profepicman). (Im not sure if this is true please someone confirm and PM me if this is not accurate)  * Before 7.00 I could type things to my allies while I moved my hero around. Now when I right click it immediately closes the chat.  * Should add another option to control the new shrines seen so many accidently turn them on just because they wanna run to them (sometimes people wanna run there but wait for their team to catch up so they can use them togheter instead they just turn them on while team is not even there). Maybe we should have a option next to the glyph/scan which activates the shrine closests to your hero. Also a hotkey that you can bind to this.  * Please let them make an option where you can turn on to permanently see allied hp and mana without pressing ALT !!! Only a few guys mentioned it but its pretty important!!  * Make it possible to swap heroes in picking screen instead of when game has started  * If you use alt + (hot key) for items and use quickcast you can't self use items by hovering you mouse over your hero portrait anymore. I'm pretty sure it's because when you press alt it now brings up that screen with your KDA cs etc infront of your hero portrait.  * Don't let the HUD adjust its own length. (switching from 4 spell unit to 6 spell unit)  * Hero portrait should be completely clear. (currently it shows status icons for example when silenced)  * Hero control HUD shouldn't shake when stunned. (overall remove all ""cosmetic"" effects)  * If there is more than 1 selected unit it should show hero portrait AND smaller icons. (same way as in pre-7.00)   Anything else we need to add?   (will update with more things from the comments)  Tried taking as many comments as I can into consideration now hard to read through them all PM me if you think I really forgot something here. Not just UI changes bugs/missing options aswell.  Since many are asking and commenting about this I just wanna make clear that I don't think the UI is better than it was before 7.00. ""Better and better"" means that it's becoming better by everyday since 7.00 was released. I still liked the old one better but I sure see potential in having a smaller UI It just needs a couple of tweaks",suggestion

Orgs if you're going to take down NoobFromUA at least give us a good official alternative.,self.DotA2,There were hundreds of thousands if not millions of Dota fans that relied on NoobFromUA to provide them with condensed highlight videos of games that they would never be able to watch. It was the perfect way for people like me who aren't able to stay up the entire night on a weekday to watch 8 hours of Dota for 5 nights a week.  And yeah there are Twitch VOD's but those still aren't condensed. A NoobFromUA vid shortened a BO3 series to 25 minutes or less while still making it feel like you didn't miss anything. A lot of Dota 2 viewers just don't have the time to watch full VOD's of every single game played but like to keep up with every single match.  My point is just come out with something official for us to use. Maybe even hire NoobFromUA to make that content for you. IMO it doesn't even matter if I have to watch/see ads or whatever as long as the content is still available I think most people will be happy.    EDIT: People are letting me know that PGL has started uploading highlights to their youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/PGLeSport  However after watching last nights highlights they dont seem nearly as good as NFUAs. Also this is only PGL and doesnt solve the problem for other tournaments. Still think the best option is to officially involve NFUA or (as people have also pointed out) do what Epicenter did and have NFUA run PGL ads before/after the vid.   EDITx2: Yes people we know that what NFUA was doing was illegal. Yes he was stealing content. Yes he was going to get taken down eventually. Yes he was a thief.   However thats not the point of this post. Whoever NFUA was doesnt matter what matters is that the Dota community has lost its primary source of high-quality highlights a service that many people depended on to watch Dota. Please use this post to discuss what should be done about this issue and not to slam NFUA. Theres other posts in which you can do that. ,suggestion

Two ideas for Chaos Knight's ultimate.,imgur.com,,suggestion
Petition to make Razor into a melee hero,self.DotA2,"Monkey King has an attack range that doubles that of all the melee heroes in Dota and yet he gets all the benefits of being a melee.  It's bad enough that he can jump down from a tree to ruin your day he can chase you down with orb of venom and get in at least 3 or 4 hits.  It makes sense lore-wise but that is frogcicle tier balancing.  Razor has been a shit tier hero for a while so why not just fuck it and let him be melee too?  **WHY RAZOR SHOULD BE MELEE**  **1. Whip is a melee weapon**  In most video games whip counts as a melee weapon.  Hell in DnD whip is a melee weapon.  Ranged weapons are usually defined by projectiles that travel as far as they can go before hitting the ground.  Whips have limited range as defined by its length.  There is no projectile in the whip the whip never leaves the user's hand.  NAME ME ONE OTHER HERO IN DOTA THAT IS RANGED AND DOESN'T SHOOT ANY PROJECTILE OF ANY KIND.  That's right. Razor is alone and he should be with his melee brethren.  **2. Razor is designed to be up and close to his enemies**  2 out of 3 of Razor's spells is only effective if he is close to his enemies.  With Static Link Razor needs to be within range to continuously drain the damage.  Same goes with the Eye of the Storm.  In most cases you have to be up in front in team fights as Razor to steal damage.  The only spell that contradicts this is Plasma Field but that spell is mostly used to punish enemies who are trying to get out of your range  **3. Benefits he will get from becoming a melee hero**  * He can buy stout shield and quelling blade to further boost his early laning stage * Vanguard will actually become viable on the hero * He will be effective with skull basher (Might be too OP) * He can cleave with Battlefury or Empower (But he doesnt really need cleave) * Never miss uphill * Sange and Yasha is usually a core on the hero and he should get the full benefit of it  He will lose the benefit of Dragon Lance and Hurricane Pike which might be a downside but Razor shouldn't be played like a bow wielding pussy.

Denying to neutrals needs to be nerfed so here is my proposa,self.DotA2,"What was once thought of as a sign of skill and luck running from three guys chasing you into a pack of jungle creeps praying for them to last hit you for that last ditch deny has become a disgusting Purge like obsession with efficiency and cowardice.    The new trend in pro games is to be hyper efficient and deny yourself not when being chased with low hp but when you dont want to walk back to base and have spent all your gold have surived a teamfight but want to go get a item or in rtz's case confusion and or boredom. This is not high risk high reward gameplay this is cheap and boring.   To remedy this i have come up with a fool proof idea to add depth and risk into denying to creeps.   **Creeps should level up just like heros when they get a kill on a player transforming them into JUNGLE PREDATORS**   Here are some basics for Jungle Predators   * unlike jungle creeps jungle predators do not move in easy reliable ways to promote stacking. Instead they behave erratically and use movement skills to ensure they are in the camp to prevent more creeps from being spawned.  * JUNGLE Predators have massive hp and mana compared to their old forms as well as gaining ultimates.  * jungle predators cannot be enchanted dominated eaten midas-ed or converted untill they are in deny range.  * dying to or creating a jungle predator (dying to a standard neutral) puts all forms of tp on cooldown for 2 minutes.  * killing a predator drops a ""creep tear"". This item can be used on yourself and enemies and allows you to hear the death screams of every creep on the map at full volume even in the fog of war. New screams added for lane creeps. Lasts for 10 minutes.   * predators do triple damage but also give triple xp and gold when killed.   * all predators have a ""iorn orb"" passive that reflects and blocks iorn talons on to the caster    **Types of Jungle Predators**   When a hero dies to a jungle creep they become a jungle predator. While also gaining all of the buffs above they do a physical transformation which makes them larger and or diffrent looking and gives them additional ""ults"". This form is shared by any one of the creeps in a specific ""camp"" (i.e. any Satyr will turn into a Teller if they get a hero kill)   Here are the different jungle predator forms.    **KOLBOLD MOTIVATOR**   Speed aura replaced with ""motivation"". When a enemy comes within melee distance of the Kobold Motivator he will run at the enemy unit at max movement speed hitting it with his whip at max attack speed for exponential damage each hit (first hit is 2hp next is 4hp next is 8hp). The kobold will not stop hitting the unit untill it dies or the target dies. Kobold Motivatior is not effected by fog of war and has true sight (cannot break sight). Cannot be controled while in motivation mode.    **MOUNTAIN TROLL**   Hill troll heal and mana aura becomes a new skill called ""Shadow Relm"". Shadow Relm is immediately cast upon transformation to Mountain Troll. Shadow Relm is a aoe much like voodoo restoration but its aoe increases every time it is cast while the unit is stationary. Cast time is the same as troll's normal healm. Any units in the aoe lose mana equal to mana aura and health equal to heal. If any regen items are used in the aoe (slaves clarities urn) the effects are reversed (heal items take away equal hp mana is drained from clarities ect). Aoe grows as long as the Troll is alive and casting and has no limit.   **Vhoul Deceiver**   Upon transformation the Vhoul Deceiver leaves its camp and hides in another random camp in the jungle. It then takes the form of one of the creeps in its new camp. If attacked and not killed it will leave the camp if no enemies have sight and move to a new camp. Gains 2 skills: Deflection: Deflects all skills and items that are not vanilla right clicks to the caster including non target skills and items such as hand of midas and helm of the dominator. BioVenom: upon death explodes in a techies like suicide that covers a area in a poison gale.    **SPECTRE**   If any member of the ghost camp kills a hero they transform into litterally specter the hero. Specter spawns at lvl 25 with no item and is controlled like a bot attacking anyone who enters the jungle where she spawned. Will ult when any hero is in deny range and steals kills from both teams with haunt. If specter kills herosnshe gets gold and can buy items. If all heros are dead on the map specter will push objectives. If specter destorys a ancient the jungle creeps win and both teams lose 50mmr dispite if they are playing ranked.    **Succubus**   If a harpy camp member gets a kill they transform into a Succubus. The Succubus has a passive ability called MARRIAGE. MARRIAGE allows it to follow any hero that comes into its aoe at first having no effect but after a while it will start to drain the affected hero's gold exponentially. While following the hero the Succubus is invulnerable and cannot be targeted. The Succubus will only leave the effected hero if the hero affected a-clicks the succubus it will activate its passive DIVORCE and return to its camp taking half of the gold of the hero affected with it. If the gold gained is less than the gold the hero had when first attracting the Succubus all pasive gold earned by the hero will go to the Succubus untill it dies.    The Succubus will randomly change targets if the hero dies in close proximity to another hero and may ""cheat"" following another hero. All heros lose money to succubus untill it dies. Succubus can only be targeted by enemy teams of the effected hero or the hero affected. When the unit dies it drops ""fancy clothes"" based on how much money it leached from heros. The fancy clothes provide no stats boosts or effects and are worthless but can be traded to shop owners for 1 gold each.   **Centuar Stampeder**   Centuars gain the ultimate ""stampede"" with a aghs effect and will run towards heros when 3 or more are close enough together for a war stomp. If the Centuar is able to war stomp with three or more heros in its aoe it will continue to stomp untill it is out of mana. When there is not enough mana to cast stomp the Centuar runs to the closest cliff and runs off it and dies.    Stop cooldown is reduced to .5 seconds mana cost reduced to 25 and mana is quadrupled.    **Omega Wolf**   The omega wolf gians several new abilities. STALK: turns omega wolf invisible but emits a growling sound when near. OMEGA POUNCE: much like mirana's leap the wolf jumps incredible distances. DRAG: much like batriders lasso the wolf is able to bite the foot of a hero and drag them to it's original camp. The hero plays a animation grabbing at the ground and screaming while it is being pulled for a short time. Drag is a channeled spell and can be interupted with a ally stun. MATE TO DEATH: if a hero is dragged back to the spawn camp the omega wolf mounts them and starts to drain 1% of hp every .25 seconds untill the heros death. If a enemy or ally hero approaches the ""den"" the rate of MATE will increase rapidly as the wolf attempts to finish before the hero can be saved via a stun. Auditory noises from the jungle are played during mate and get faster as mating increases.    If there are multiple Omega Wolfs they will hunt together and create mating dens random points on the map that act as creep camps to mate in. If dens are created and no heros have been caught in 5 minutes wolves will hint couriers.     **TELLERS**   If any unit from a Satyr camp kills a hero they become Tellers. Tellers gain a passive abilty called ""Charge"". CHARGE: Teller holds a stance and begins channeling as soon as it is spawed. Every death on the map (lane creeps jungle creeps heros rosh) charges the Teller's shockwave attack. When heros enter the camp AOE the Teller releases Shockwave. Shockwave now has 3 forms. 1. Shockwave: a increased damage shockwave from collecting a small amount of spirits 2. CAME WAY YA NAY HA: a massive shockwave energy blast that lingers for several seconds after collecting a moderate amount of spirits 3.Final Form Spirit Bomb: a planet destroying shockwave that when casts kills every non jungle creep unit in the Tellers jungle. 4. Not even my final form spirit bomb: if roshan dies and each enemy dies on both teams before a shockwave was released Teller turns Gold and goes Super Satyr"" foating to the center of the mid lane when discovered and launches the SUPER SATYR SPIRIT BOMB- killing every unit on the map including all creeps heros and roshan.   Note: Tellers make auditory charge sounds as they charge shockwaves. These sounds are a man yelling and gasping for air.   **Godless Golem**   Cooldown of rock throw reduced to .10 seconds Killing a shard unit creates 2 mini shard units Shard and mini shard units mana cost for rock throw reduced to 0.   **OGER GOD** Frost armor effect lasts 20 more seconds.

EDIT: Ok 5-10 minutes is probably plenty. They apparently listened or changed it by themselves but the he has his segment after each match and not just the series. And those of you who say the schedule doesn't allow more time: remember that after a 2-0 series there is +1 hour they get so I'm pretty sure a little more time with our trusty Weatherman won't hurt anyone.,suggestion

MMR under 500 should be displayed as <500,self.DotA2,"1 MMR being a thing gives people an incentive to troll. Whether its Norms or ranked some people like to make it a ""race to the bottom"". Blizzard remedied this situation in Overwatch by making MMRs less than 500 display as <500 and not showing gains or losses until you get above 500 to prevent people from calculating their true SR.

Valve: A Proposed solution to last minute roster-drop problem,self.DotA2,"Whether intentional or not there is a huge problem facing the current system of adding and removing players from teams: the single day roster-lock. Because this lock is a single day teams could simply align a new available player in secret before dropping their teammate days or minutes before the lock. This leaves the dropped player severely disadvantaged in finding a team in a fair amount of time.  My proposition is as follows: instead of having a single day that teams can no longer add or remove players **there are two dates instead: a ""drop-lock"" and an ""add-lock""**. Once the drop-lock occurs a team can no longer drop any of their players. But any players dropped the day of this are not in vain: they still have some time left to find a new team. Any team with fewer than five players can still add players to their team before the add-lock date perhaps two weeks after the drop-lock. This would easily and effectively solve the problem of unfairly excluding very talented players from acquiring a team quickly enough.  Any thoughts on this revised system?",suggestion

6.87 is a great patch but the presentation feels rushed. Here's a list of #polish suggestions,self.DotA2,"**No new item sound effects**  * Tome of Knowledge is very underwhelming. It recycles the level up animation and is completely silent.  * Bloodthorn recycles the Orchid sound effect when it should have its own unique sound. I've always adored Dota 2's sound design because you can tell what's happening with your eyes closed. This trend should continue.  * Hurricane Pike also recycles the Force Staff sound effect. Such a huge opportunity for some amazing sound effects with a name like HURRICANE PIKE.  * Blight Stone might not be required but could be nice to have a very small sound effect like a mini Desolator impact sound.  &nbsp;  **Aghs upgrades are getting messy**  This might not be a huge issue once we get the upcoming UI update but [as this post already covered](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4htvqb/wouldnt_it_be_nice_to_have_cooldown_on_aghs_with/) there is no feedback to the player for some of the newer Aghs upgrades such as what the Aghs upgrade does and failing to display the cooldowns.  &nbsp;  **Scan uses recycled assets and is a little confusing at first**  [As discussed on this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4hadd4/til_scan_uses_the_same_minimap_indicator_as/d2onvg5) Scan should not use the TP minimap assets. In addition it isn't immediately obvious to players what green or red mean when using scan.  &nbsp;  **Scan is unfriendly to spectators**  /u/somethingToDoWithMe: > The scan ability is extremely spectator unfriendly. Both teams have the same color of scan so when a scan is used you have to take notice of the team and how recently the scan was used to figure out which team used the scan.  >I also feel that having something that important be only on the minimap is bad for spectating. I think they need to show something over the actual ingame map so that observers can just move the camera over to the location and show the viewers what the area scanned was.   /u/aliboy: > A voice line and event text should show up - similar to what exists currently for fortifying structures. Scan should have a default announcer line that says something along the lines of;  > ""Dire have activated Scan""  > ""Radiant have activated Scan""  > And when you are in game and your team uses it the announcer should say "" Scan activated""   /u/VampoRainze: > show scan in game not just minimap.  &nbsp;  **Dota lore**  /u/thjake: > no lore for new items and abilities since 6.86   /u/-De-Koenisch-: > Please rename Scan into something less technical.   I agree with this. Scan should be renamed to something that fits the lore of Dota a little better.

Let us Alt-Click our XP bar to tell our teammates our level & how much xp we need to the next one.,self.DotA2,I find myself alt-clicking my XP bar quite often as I want to tell a teammate that I'm soon level 6 or something similar. If you're close to reaching a crucial level it would be great to be able to tell this quickly as it can change the outcome of a fight if your team plays accordingly.     It's also useful for telling a teammate to stay out of XP range so I can have solo XP and reach for example level 6. ,suggestion

Quests shouldn't have timers.,self.DotA2,"There have been many posts of people rushing an item that shouldn't be rushed and ruining games because of quests that require you to get an item before a certain minute mark.  A quest should not be failed till the game is over. A lot of people will simply give up on the game if they don't get in item by the required minute mark.  In the future Valve should avoid puting timers on quests but rather make us buy the item and then do something with it. For instance ""Build solar crest before game timer reaches X/Y/Z minutes."" would now be ""Purchase a Solar crest and kill 2/4/6 heroes that are affected by the Solar crest debuff.""  So in general instead of rushing an item a quest would have you buy an item and then do something with it.  This type of quest allows us to get the item at any point in the game. Getting the item sooner will give you more time to complete the quest but you also won't risk failing the quest if you don't rush it. It's also a lot more support friendly than the item rush quests.    **TL;DR:** Quests should not have timers that fail before the game ends as that disincentivizes players from trying to win the game if they fail such a quest. ",suggestion
Please Remove The Hero of The Day from Ranked,self.DotA2,I love the idea of rotating heros of the day but I do not feel that it has a place in ranked.  It just gives an advantage to picking a few heroes and promotes spamming them in ranked.  The mango itself is kind of silly to me but I feel that it gives a weird advantage right now and can be balanced a bit more if not removed entirely.  Instead of giving the mango to people that simply pick the hero of the day give it to people that random.    Edit: There seems to be confusion in the comments.  I have literally no problem with randoming and I do not think that this is a sign of the end times.  However I feel that ranked should be mostly free of advantages like this.  Randoming gave a risk vs reward deal because you could random into bad heroes for your line up heroes that are easily counter able or even bad heroes in the meta.  To balance this out dota gave you some extra gold to make you feel better about doing it.  This never decided matches flat out and neither does the mango.  However the risk vs reward deal is mostly gone with the Hero of the Day.  This is because you can pick a hero out of the 10 and get a reward.  For example I have been picking TA and she becomes the hero of the day.  I now have an advantage when spamming her for that day.  With randoming that was impossible because you did not know what you were going to get.  I feel that this mechanic is cool as it promotes players to have larger hero pools but I do not feel that it has a place necessarily in ranked.  I do not want my ranked games to be influenced (not decided) by a hero of the day mechanic that seems to be geared towards newer players.  Sorry for any confusion and sorry to the devs for complaining.  I genuinely love dota 2 and I love the new patch so far.  Keep up the great work.  Edit 2: I might be wrong about it being a hero of the day.  If it is not I am sorry but I still believe that the risk vs reward is too small.  However many people have brought up good points that these are like small balance changes to heroes in each game.  I think thats actually a really cool way of thinking about it and I think its useful to remember that when you discuss this change.,suggestion

If the target hero dies while Riki is in their inventory Riki is transferred to the closest flying animal courier. If no animal courier is available Riki will lose an extra 120 gold and an animal courier will spawn at the base with Riki in its inventory.  If the animal courier holds Riki in its inventory it will gain Riki's passives however will not gain an auto-attack.

Valve should introduce more ways to earn compendium points,self.DotA2,At this moment we can't really earn new levels without buying additional points or 50 level compendium. Points drop rarely.

This gave points every week for your unwanted items.   * **Old achievements** - By this I mean 10 Hero challenge and daily hero challenge reliable ways to earn additional points.   * **Points Charm** - Many hates this idea but that would be great if compendium owners will get these. 3 Correct Predictions - 50 points. 2 Incorrect Predictions - 2 charms fragments/100 coins.   * **Player Cards** - I wonder if they actually introduce this. Last year we were collecting cards to get spectator gems and points for all cards. Volvo pls   * **Points for collecting Immortals** - Ex. you get all non-rare items from first chest you get some points.    * **Challenges for points** - Just like actual challenges but grants you points instead.   * **Points Betting/Predictions** - You pay points and choose which team you think will win. If you were right you get back points + additional points. However if you were wrong then you lose all points you bet. More points you bet = More points you will get.      That's all I came up with.

Valve can we have a mini AI tournament for TI6?,self.DotA2,We can do something like this: http://sscaitournament.com/  Not only would this be entertaining but it'd give us [hopefully] better AI. The tournament winning AI doesn't necessarily have to be put into the game if for example it simply isn't scripted well or properly. If anything the tournament could serve as an inauguration of sorts the beginning of community collaboration on the AI. I feel like Dota has come so far yet our bots remain absolutely atrocious. All it would take on Valve's part would be to make the current bot AI open source and to put like.. 1000$ (pocket change for GabeN) on the line for the winner. Like I said if for some reason Valve deems the winning AI subpar then worst case scenario we had a super refreshing and entertaining mini tournament and a better starting point for further AI work. What do we think?   EDIT:    ..  but perhaps certain rules could be stipulated to prevent this that is for example the winner is not simply the bot that wins that games but rather behaves the most like a human!,suggestion

If the blink mechanic is to stay (which looks likely) what could  make it vastly easier to learn is to provide some sort of visual/auditory feedback. This way you would know when you have blinked over the max range or when you have succeeded in clicking between 960-1200 units.  &nbsp;  For example;  * If you blink 960 units or less (which would include clicking over 1200 and being punished) the game plays the standard blink sound and animation. * If you blink over 960 units the game plays a slightly modified blink sound to indicate you have made a good blink.  I believe this would make the mechanic far more accessible to those attempting to learn it as it provides positive feedback after every blink forcing the player to eventually learn the range subconsciously.  &nbsp;  Edit: Well I hope Valve saw this now it's going to get buried beneath th... my download just finished bye.,suggestion

Invoker Buff/Rework: MasterZed's Solution,self.DotA2,"I'm the guy that posted [A Brief History of Invoker.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3d8ris/a_brief_history_of_invoker/)  This is suggested mini-rework that streamlines Invoke and the Aghanims upgrade as well as a simple buff in what I feel is an overall better design. I've been sitting on this idea for about 6 years now - thought now might be a good time to post it.  &nbsp;  ##Short Version:  **Invoke:**    *Invoke is now a core ability gotten for free at level 1.*      * Think Earth Spirit stone remnants. You start the game with Invoke level 0. Points can be put into Invoke to improve it. * 20 Mana at all levels     * 30s CD at Invoke level 0 * 20/14/9/5s CD at Invoke levels 1/2/3/4 first available at level 6/9/12/16.  &nbsp;  **Aghanim's Sceptre:**     *Removes mana cost for Invoke and adds one effective level to Quas Wex Exort AND Invoke.*       * Applies to orbs passive bonus AND what they give to spells. Lvl 7 Quas would be considered lvl 8 giving 8hp/s per orb (instead of 7hp/s) and creating an icewall that slows for 160% and lasts 13.5s (instead of 140% and 12s). Lvl 1 Exort would be considered lvl 2 etc.      * Invoke is likewise lifted one effective level - lvl 3 Invoke would be considered lvl 4 with 5s CD. Level 4 Invoke is lifted to a special Aghs only level 5 with a 2s CD.  &nbsp;  Invoke Level|Level Available|Invoke CD|Aghs Invoke CD :--|:--|:--|:-- 0|1 (Free @ Lvl 1)|30s|20s 1|6|20s|14s 2|9|14s|9s 3|12|9s|5s 4|16|5s|2s  &nbsp;  **What do these changes mean:**      * In effect it's as if Invoker starts the game at level 2 instead of level 1 as he doesnt need to invest a point into Invoke to get spells. The net result is that for the first few levels (until he puts a point into Invoke) one orb will be one level higher giving a subtle but effective buff to everything he does. QW could get a point in E to help with LH EQ could get a point in W to flash farm or neutral etc.     * Invoker will start the game picking from one of three spells (like every other hero) get a second spell at level 2 (like every other hero) and then get a power spike at level 6 that peaks at level 16 with an ultimate that actually scales well.     * Aghanim's gives everything it did before PLUS additional functionality above just a CD reduction - something needed since the introduction of Octarine Core.  &nbsp;  ##Longer version:  *Why does Invoker need a buff:*      * In public games he has the 14th lowest win rate at 42% which drops further as MMR drops. Public win rate is only *one* factor among many - there are many heroes that have low pub win rates (such as Wisp) BUT they are still viable picks in higher level and pro games. However:     * Professionally he fares just as bad or worse - in the TI5 group stages he had the lowest effectiveness of the 90 or so heroes picked losing 5 out of 5 games. By the main event teams had abandoned him and Invoker was never picked once. He literally was the worst hero at TI5.  &nbsp;  *What is wrong with Invoker that requires buffing?*      * In short the meta has left him behind. The biggest change was the introduction of dual runes - mid is now dominated by heroes with low CD nukes that get guaranteed bottle refills. This allows them to easily CS lane clear to get runes and quickly pressure the enemy tower should their opponent leave the lane.     * QW simply can't lane against the common mids and his CS suffers terribly. He has no flash farm to make up for lost CS unlike most other mids.     * E style builds are far too level dependant and take too long to come online. The meta is all about quickly transitioning into ganks and team fights. The days of slow farming mids that spend ten minutes in lane are gone and EQ has been left behind in the faster paced game.     * This is not suggestion that other mid heroes don't also need a nerf. But the game itself has changed and become faster paced. I feel Invoker won't be a viable pick in the game without some sort of rework to make him come online faster - something buffing spells won't achieve.  &nbsp;  *Why is this rework good?*      * It doesnt just tweak a number here or there it enhances the essence of what makes the Invoker unique by boosting his core functionality. I believe it handles *many* of Invoker's flaws in one subtle change while at the same time simplifying him. Most suggested changes I see are sort of clunky band-aid fixes - this goes to the root of the problem.     * Players can use this extra flexibility to build Invoker how they want - QW could get a point of E at lvl 2 to help its low base damage OR keep the same build and leave lane a level earlier. E builds could invest in a level of W to wave clear with meteor. In short it keeps the skill ceiling high without lowering the skill floor.     * It alleviates his major weakness: level dependence (what forces him to go mid). Invoker could more easily safelane or offlane and actually contribute at lvl 1 and 2. QW invoker can start ganking 1 level earlier putting him on par with heroes like Storm TA QoP etc. EQ Invokers rushing dual spirits won't take so long to come on-line - experienced players know there is a huge xp jump required to go from level 8 to 9 so being able to get them at 8 is about 3 minutes quicker.      * It doesnt homogenize and make Invoker like other heroes. I've seen suggestions to give Invoker a new spell that is a low CD spammable nuke just like the other mids. Homogenization is the bane of game design.  The rework doesnt just hand over a mindless buff players must use skill to earn the buff this rework gives - the very essence of what playing Invoker entails. A flat base damage boost might help lower skill players (ie lower the skill floor) but it does nothing to enhance the potential skill ceiling higher skill players can achieve.     * Best of all it doesnt change his overall power curve. Generally mid and late game Invoker is well balanced. This buff is only evident at early levels - once you invest your first point into Invoke (typically around level 6 or 7) the power curve normalizes and you are at the same level power as before.     * In short I feel that having to invest a skill point in order to start invoking spells is a relic of an older age of DotA where limitations from the Warcraft map editor still lingered. If Invoker was made from scratch right now I believe the ability for Invoker to Invoke spells would just be an intrinsic part of the hero like Earth Spirit and his remnants.   &nbsp;  *Cold Snap at level one? Won't that be OP?*      * This I suspect will be the biggest complaint and it might have been valid - once. Cold snap is so heavily nerfed now that its barely even worth casting in lane to harass with. A max of 4 (but most likely 2 or 3) 0.4s stuns each doing 7 dmg - far less dangerous than many other lvl 1 spells. Dont forget that Invokers get cold snap at lvl 2 and you dont see them breaking the game at that point.   &nbsp;  *Why not just buff some spell or add some extra effect to a spell?*      * I've seen a lot of suggestions to this effect. The first problem is that buffing a particular spell (such as reverting the forge spirit nerf) only helps *some* builds. What is good about this rework is that it very slightly buffs ALL spells and all builds (as on average one orb will be one level higher) - but only early game then it normalizes.     * I've also seen a lot of suggestions to give more BKB-piercing ability to spells. Again this only benefits builds that use that particular spell. In my opinion its bad design to start giving everyone spells that go through BKB (again homogenization). Balance stems from heroes having strengths and weaknesses and using those strengths to overcome your enemies. Icefrog has so expertly balanced this game by building on strengths to buff a hero rather than removing weaknesses and making everything bland.  &nbsp; 	 *Why not just buff base damage?*      * It's true that this would help WQ but E builds dont need more base damage - they have other problems. This rework gives WQ the option to pick up a level of E (say at level 2 or 3) to help last hit without making EQ OP (which necessitated the nerf in the first place). Alternatively if WQ is laning ok (say against a Dragon Knight) he can begin ganking a level earlier something much more valuable than a +X to dmg.  &nbsp;  *Why not make Aghanim's a more compelling upgrade with extra spell effects?*      * This is another commonly seen suggestion. I feel my idea is better as it builds towards simplicity rather than increasing complexity and having to code and balance extra spells or spell effects. A player can pick up aghs and instantly know what it does without having to read spell descriptions.     * This new Aghs would give a uniform burst of power whether gotten early game as first item or late game as 3rd or 4th. It would work on and improve all builds and styles of Invoker play whether pusher ganker semi-carry etc. It wouldnt be 'must have' overshadowing other items yet would always remain a viable pickup. Lastly it would help differentiate Aghs from OC.     * I also see a lot of '360 degree deafening blast should be a part of Aghs.' Having this as soon as Aghs is picked up would be OP but my suggested rework could allow the 360 degree blast to be gotten up to 3 lvls earlier depending on how skill points are assigned (ie take all orbs to lvl 6).  &nbsp;  *What's with the rescaling of Invoke?*      * Invoke scales very strangely. Combined with the increasing mana cost per level causes players to get 1 level of Invoke then leave it until 15/16/17. Having a flat mana cost and rescaling Invoke CD to 22/15/10/5 gives a compelling reason to skill it up. But most importantly players still have the choice - builds such as rushing dual spirits relying primarily on spirits/snap would probably keep Invoke low.     * 20 mana for all levels of Invoke was chosen simply because the old system of increasing mana cost stopped players from even leveling the skill - the core aspect of the hero (Invoking) became overly prohibitive. Especially now with the ability to swap Invoke slots the mana cost was too high. From a ""logical"" design perspective it shouldn't increase each level unless the spell actually does something extra.     * Aghs Invoke CD reduction also scales really confusingly - reducing by 6s/9s/8s then only 3s at level 4. This rework gets both normal and Aghs CD on the same simple scale plus cleverly includes the 2s Invoke CD as a special Aghs only lvl 5 Invoke.     * I've moved Invoke skill ups to 6/9/12/16. This is for two reasons: firstly it helps bring the power curve more in line with other heroes - a big boost at 6 then hitting max at 16. Secondly players are unlikely to skill up Invoke at all until around lvl 6 or so anyway - this simplifies things and avoids the 'bad player trap'. The only reason Invoke had to be made available at 2/7/12/17 was out of necessity to actually have spells to cast - this rescale makes 'Invoke' worthy of being an ultimate.  &nbsp;  ##Summary:   I've been playing DotA for over a decade now and have at least 3000 games of Invoker. I worked in the early days doing play testing and was one of the ones who submitted suggestions when Invoker was first reworked (6.50).  On the whole I feel that this is a simple and elegant restructuring of Invoker that gives a subtle but useful buff early game that evens out by mid game as well as making other styles of play and other builds viable without 'dumbing down' the hero. Lastly the Aghs/Invoke rework streamlines and simplifies it as well as giving a meaningful buff to an item that needs it.  I hope you like this suggestion. If so please help by promoting it and bringing it to the attention of those that make the big decisions.  &nbsp;  MasterZed ",suggestion

Can we host a DotA tournament for TB?,self.DotA2,I'm a shit redditor so bare with me.  Totalbiscuit and his videos have been apart of my life for a long time now getting me involved in the PC gaming industry as well as getting me into both DotA and Terraria among other things so i was wondering if maybe we (as a community) could hold a tournament out of respect with maybe any money that we make (if we do) goes to a liver cancer charity or something.    I have no idea if this has already become an idea or whatever but hey i thought i'd make a piece about it.  Any feedback would be great.  p.s. i'm shit at formatting.  (EDIT) After some people have raised the point over the last few hours about TB maybe not wanting something like this going on I have instead asked my partners who have started working on this whether they are up for turning this into a charity tournament in which the winning team chooses a charity in which we give the money too.  TB shall not be related with this directly due to the opinions voiced.  Thanks for all the feedback provided so far it has really helped!  (EDIT 2) For anyone who wants to help in anyway to get this tournament going head on over to r/dotamasterrace and head to the stickied post.  There should be a fair bit of info regarding our current developments.  Also for those who want to sign their teams up for the tourney you can head over to the Team Building thread that is also stickied on r/dotamasterrace,suggestion

Can Some Sort Of Prime Matchmaking Be Introduced Into Dota 2?,self.DotA2,For those that don't know prime matchmaking is a system that has been incorporated into cs-go not to long ago. Basically you can only use the prime matchmaking servers if you register your account to a phone number you must also have a level 21 account. Only one account can be registered to a phone number. Prime Matchmaking was made to combat smurfs and hackers in cs-go as most people would register their main account to their phone. People often use alt accounts for hacking and smurfs obviously. So they couldn't register their smurf or hacked account into prime unless they bought a new phone for their alternate account.  On to why dota could use a variation of prime matchmaking. Right now theirs more account boosters and smurfs than ever before that makes the game very unenjoyable. Its annoying to see that i have a level 87 profile but im being matched up against a lvl 22 profile who is obviously a smurf or account buyer. A prime matchmaking system in dota would make games much more enjoyable for most people. Let the smurfs account buyers and boosters play together. This would clearly result in longer queue times but even with a registered prime account you can still play normal ranked matches. Just to be clear your MMR would be the same in both Prime and ranked matches. It would just match you up with other users who have prime enabled. Anyways just a way to make the quality games better this has been brought up before by others just thought i would reiterate it. Thanks :)  Edit: I see alot of comments about burner phones and such this is 100% an issue. Was thinking maybe you have to be a certain level to join prime matchmaking? Not sure what that level should be.  Edit 2: /u/SirClarkus Just brought up the idea of making registered prime users enter a code sent by text at the start of each month in order to play prime matchmaking. This would be implemented so if someone bought a throw away phone they would have to pay the monthly fee to their phone carrier in-order to continue playing Prime Matchmaking. This might be a hassle to some people but its still an idea worth discussing! ,suggestion

Dear Valve please make an actual coin toss for Radiant/Dire/Firstpick at the TI7 main stage games inside the arena,self.DotA2,The coin toss to decide which team can choose **firstpick/secondpick** or **side (Radiant/Dire)** is usually done in the pregame lobby. In almost every tournament the spectators and the casting panel don't get to see who chose what and who won the coin toss. So it would be cool to make the coin toss on stage and make the captains of the teams choose firstpick and side live in the arena.  Advantages of doing it live:  1. In many real sports such as football the coin toss marks that the game is about to start. It creates certain hype for the viewers. 2. The panel could comment on the choice of side and its implications before the game starts and not only when the first bans are already done. 3. It would be much easier for stats people to collect the side choices and create some statistics. This could help determining whether there is an actual Dire/Radiant advantage in the current patch/meta. 4. It gives some insight for the viewers on what a team prefers. Nobody usually takes the time to collect and publish this data (I have seen it only a few times by Noxville). 5.

Make DOTA Great Again : A Wishlist for DOTA,self.DotA2,A wishlist of everything I wish Valve did for DOTA 2:  **Provide a sense of community:**  * Address the solo focus of the game. The game has a lack of community especially with the removal of guilds. * Weekly/biweekly Battlecup auto online tournaments even similar to War3/SC2. Ideally tournament qualifiers could be run through the Dota client itself. * Guild/clan interface * Guild competitions (guilds score points for battlecup/ranked) * Revamp region chat * Inhouse tournament interface and resources to host tourneys * Facebook and social media integration (Popular Facebook groups such as Dota Trading) * Most easily accessible through the front page currently front page atm is mostly chests and useless clutter  **Long term goals outside of simply MMR**  Dota lacks any sense of progression. Even the profile trophy level is effectively meaningless. Dota at least used to have the old level up chest which gave some kind of sense of reward for playing. Right now there is no incentive to play outside MMR.  * Permanent quest and loot system give the quest system long term goals adding meaning to specific rewards Zeus skin for 1000 games. * Could add features such as server wide missions to reveal upcoming heroes / events / battle pass branches / chests  **Regular updates and maintenance**  * Proof check and update tool tips fix all of the poor talent explanations and even add an alt hover on talents even * Small balance passes (5-10% buffs/nerfs) on the game regularly every 1-2months * No major patch lasting more than 6 months * Fixes to the watch tab slow loading times improper filtering ordering of games removal of cost of watching tournaments ingame most want to watch the top tier games but has become difficult post ranked change * Fix current ingame items that are broken such as this HUD https://i.imgur.com/JSDQpwI.jpg  **Unranked Draft Phase**  *  ~~Change or removed the unranked AP draft phase gone my friends who play unranked seem to hate it leads to frustration and counters which do not really have a place in a unranked environment~~    **Behaviour system lacking**  * Behaviour should not be put ahead of player skill in most situations * Checking the reports with human oversight like CS:GO Overwatch. * Additional options on report such as boosting and scripting  **More game customization**  * Profile customization make it unique with loading screens and HUDs able to be used on profiles along with other items. * Custom hero grids * Custom item grids * Custom friend list and ability to filter friends * Loading screens used as backgrounds * Hero showcase allowing you to show off your fav hero/set combo  **Pro circuit integration**  I cant stress this one enough. Dotas biggest appeal to many is its esports scene and youd barely even know it existed from the client alone. Having to access Pro Circuit points and standings and event times all on other third party sites is unacceptable. Even though Liquidpedia does a phenomenal job it should be accessible in client ESPECIALLY Minors and Majors which are *Valve sponsored events*. Leaderboards should be visible in client too.  * Pro circuit information updates and a leaderboard all shown and accessed easily ingame * Circuit long fantasy competition to increase player investment in the circuit prizes could be dota items but even some special rewards such as a chance to win a trip to TI / Major / Minor * Ingame match ticker and news feed so all players can see when games are coming up should be located on front page  **Fix the Arcade:**  * Provide Arcade with either a small scale permanent state version of the game still located inside Dota (so that custom games don't require massive fixes every patch) OR Valve take care each patch to ensure they do not destroy the entire Arcade. This could even be by giving Arcade developers more time to prepare for patches forewarning of what is changing on the backend etc. * New games find it difficult if not impossible to break into the current scene of Arcade games leading to new games stopping development and dying and even popular games slowly fade due to boredom because they are only games being played (see: ReIncarnation RPG). * Every game should have dedicated servers new games are often unplayable due to latency  **Bring back events**  We used to have events every few months which many players appreciated some of my friends favorite thing about dota was seeing who could go the furthest in some of these events such as the Year Beast appealing to many casual players. Valve should be having a major event every 6 months. Events such as:  * New Bloom * Diretide * Dark Moon * Frostivus * Wraith-Night * Siltbreaker  **Items**  Workshop creators sold out reduced profit margins exclusivity of being included in immortal sets / TI / battlepasses leaves any leftout in the cold https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/62991t/the_dota_2_workshop_and_its_ecosystem_are_dying/  * Cosmetic value balance in general cosmetics are generally now worthless or high price variance across cosmetics seems weak * Getting rid of features that some enjoyed such as item crafting from scrolls and item deleting with a chance to get a higher quality tier item this might be problematic now with so many items but could still be implemented in a different way  **Tutorial**  * Create a brand new tutorial system one that entices inspires and shows new players the true potential of the game would lead to many new players entering the game * Tutorial could even have a few different branches aimed at different aspects of DOTA allowing even older players to train and improve their skills even while waiting on queues ie. Tower / Creep last hitting  There is no excuse for Valve not updating the game with the amount of money and resources they have we should expect more from Valve than what they give us. The goal of this isn't to directly criticize Dota itself as a game but to look at the lack of focus and failure of Valve to keep the game and community moving forward. Just wanted to mention that many of these features have been in the game at some point or another Valve can do it and should bring some of these features and ideas back.

People who don't pick should abandon instead of randoming.,self.DotA2,I've had multiple games now where people will wait out the entire hero pick phase then lose gold for 30 seconds just so they can random a hero without being counterpicked. I think that people who do this should be assessed with an abandon.  The last second random almost always ruins the team composition which was the entire reason the ability to random in the last ten seconds was removed.,suggestion

Move ppd to the right of the panel,self.DotA2,This is not a criticism at all as I have no problem with ppd taking the majority of the dialogue on the panel.   However if he does continue to do so having him right beside day9 really makes it awkward to have all the conversation between those two on the left and it makes it seem like merlini and akke are being blocked out. Just moving ppd to the right of the panel will hopefully make it easier for merlini and akke to jump in as well.   Just a thought    edit: ppd is right now. ,suggestion
Million of times requesting this can XPM PLEASE be frozen when one person hits lvl 25,self.DotA2,Mandatory text box. This has been requested so many times.

That is exactly what you're saying and it sounds kinda stupid.  Edit 2: Why you ask?

Status Resistance what i think sucks;,self.DotA2,"allright i know i'm nobody but while i like the idea of status resistance there's a few case where i feel it shouldn't apply.  first of all it shouldn't apply to every kind of banish (OD's prison SD's disruption... and by extension stuff like eul's/tornado) the reason is very easy: teamplay in dota is important comboing spells between teammate is a thing and it's just not possible to adapt your timing for every possible value especially in a split second.  **Edit:** after all those disables aren't stun they disable but they also protect the target for the duration so their main usage is comboing. making comboing sort of ""random"" for those spells feels like bad design.  **Edit2:** also those spells typically don't have a stun bar making chaining stun even more difficult.  second: it shouldn't apply to channeled stun (fiend's grip and shackles). channels are debuff that disable the caster and the target and seeing fiend's grip last 3 second on a late game DK is just ridiculous.  **Edit2:** also at the moment thos spells get cut down in duration sharply losing a lot of their duration. same for any DoT spell not tied to a slow.  third: although it already works like that i'm still pointing it out: it shouldn't work on aura style debuff (chronosphere BH static storm)  TLDR: status resistance should only affect ""shoot and forget"" style debuffs as opposed to channels. it also shouldn't affect disruption style debuffs to not screw with comboing/setting up between teammates.",suggestion

Note that most of these are not considered bugs. They are things that I think are hindering the hero unecessarily and would be nice if they were changed/tweaked. -  ---  #Part 2 of 2: Suggestions and other minor things.  ##[](/hero-abaddon) Abaddon  * Total number of subjects: 17 * Number of bugs: 8 (previous post) * Number of minor issues: 2.5 (this post) * Number of other stuff: 6.5 (this post)  ^^^other ^^^stuff ^^^includes ^^^inconsistencies ^^^inconveniences ^^^and ^^^suggestions  --- #1. Several updates to the ability tooltips  ###Issues:  * Mist Coil shows the damage and heal in one line. Issue with this is when pressing ALT it shows amplified values. But the heal does not get amplified so this is wrong information. * Aphotic Shield doesn't list its damage type. * Aphotic Shield should have a new line for its area damage. Its damage values are equal to the shield capacity value but the damage is amplified by spell damage while the capacity is not. So the damage should have its line and show amplified values when holding ALT while the damage capacity line should not.  ###suggestions:  * Add ALT notes to his abilities. Really except for a single one on Borrowed Time none of them have ALT notes. And there is plenty of information which could be added: * Mist Coil's spell immunity interaction (can target allies but not enemies) * Mist Coil's projectile speed and it being disjointable * Mist Coil's damage type on Abaddon (pure) and that it is lethal * Aphotic Shield dealing aoe damage even when expiring or getting dispelled * Aphotic Shield buff being inactive on Abaddon during Borrowed Time * Aphotic Shield not damaging invisible/fogged enemies * Curse of Avernus not slowing for illusions but granting them the buff * Curse of Avernus working against enemy buildings but not for allied buildings * Curse of Avernus buff being placed on attack begin and debuff on attack hit * Borrowed Time not healing from the damage instance which passively activates it * Borrowed Time being castable while stunned but not silenced but can auto-activate even while silenced  [Here is an image showing the current tooltips compared to the suggested versions] (http://i.imgur.com/3QQ7goW.png) (modified npc_abilities and dota_english txt to show how it would look ingame)  ###I prepared the npc_abilities and dota_english files so they could be just copy-pasted over the original ones. At the bottom of this post you can find the modified parts of those files.  ---  #2. Add a visual effect to allies affected by Borrowed Time aura  The aghs aura from Borrowed Time has no visual feedback on affected allies whatsoever. This is a disadvantage for both allies and enemies. Allies may forgot about the aghs and don't realise they are 50% more tanky now and enemies may not notice that Abaddon having aghs and may overcomit on his team.  Here is an example of effects which could be used (using already existing effects from Borrowed Time)  I replaced Drum of Endurance's visual effects with abaddon_borrowed_time_h.vpcf and abaddon_ambient_mist_b.vpcf. They are clearly visible but not too much and can directly be associated with Abaddon so it would be easy to tell that that hero is affected by Borrowed Time aura. The aura only lasts up to 10 seconds and it has a strong effect so I think it can be a bit flashier.  [This is how it looks like] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnljrbQDuRk)  ---  #3. Make allies unable to disjoint allied projectiles.  Currently projectiles are disjointable regardless of team.  This means an ally can disjoint your Mist Coil Ethereal Blade and Fortune's End (Oracle's Q).  In my opinion disjointing should be only a beneficial move done to dodge enemy spells and not allied spells since disjointing allied spells has no upsides whatsoever. Like an ally will never attempt to dodge your spell intentionally. They will also not think of the possibility of it happening. So as of now as Abaddon or Oracle you have to wait for your ally to use their blink before you can heal them or dispel them or protect them with e-blade. It can get frustrating sometimes.  Yes you could prevent this by communicating but really even if you play with a 5 stack and open mic you'll not announce every Mist Coil you cast on your blinkers.  It would be quite benificial for Abaddon and Oracle if this was not a thing.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-crqmWTqs)  ---  #4. Make Aphotic Shield able to damage invisible/fogged units  It's a non-targeted aoe effect. Why is it unable to hit invisible units within range? Other spells which had this property (Scream of Pain Death Pulse Shukuchi) were changed to affect fogged/invisible units in range. I think Aphotic Shield is the last aoe spell which can't.  ---  #5. Borrowed Time heals form Hearstopper Aura and False Promise.  Hearstopper Aura is supposed to be ""negative regeneration"" but yet it uses pure damage flagged as hp removal.  False Promise is pure flagged as hp removal as well.  Both of them completely bypass any form of damage manipulation.. except for Borrowed Time and Ghostship's rum. They even bypass Borrowed Time's aura. Other hp-removal effects bypass Borrowed Time and Ghostship but these 2 don't. Armlet's degen Soul Rip's aoe hp gather thingy Ghostship's rum wear-off damage all are hp removal and bypass Borrowed Time and Ghostship's rum.  Funny part is neither Hearstopper Aura nor False Promise can passively proc Borrowed Time. Because they are flagged as hp removal and the passive-triggering ignores that.  [video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfQPr2t4jdc)  The hp removal flag should be consistant. Heartstopper and False Promise should bypass everything like how other hp removal spells do.  ---  #6. Make Borrowed Time ignore 0 damage instances for its passive triggering  Basically I suggest giving Borrowed Time the Blink Dagger treatment: Do not auto-activate on 0 damage instances. Remember when your blink on TA would get disabled during Refraction? Yea Borrowed Time auto-activates even when you take physical damage during Guardian Angel or any damage during False Promise wasting its cooldown.  Borrowed Time already ignores magical damage while spell immune but it does not do that when affected by other damage negating effects.  [Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJVVwnD4Mvs)  ---  #7. Put some consistancy in Curse of Avernus' behavior on illusions.  Controversal since it is a strong passive. But inconsistent stuff like this bothers me.  Curse of Avernus: Places the buff on each of the illusion's attacks but does not place a debuff on attack targets. So it works partially for illusions.  Abaddon is not an illusion hero so would it be strong to make it fully work for illus? Before 7.00 I'd have say make it not work for them at all since the attack speed bonus doesn't work for them anyway. But now it does work for them.  [video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB2cyhE817U)  ---  #8.Abaddon does not unsheath his sword upon denying allies  He only shows his sword when an enemy is nearby. So when denying he attacks the ally without his sword. He should get his sword out when an enemy is nearby and when starting an attack.  [video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD6iWOS0c4c)  ---  #9. Abaddon uses his self-deny lines when dying to an enemy Abaddon Mist Coil.  Yes these issues are getting very minor. This is where I stop.  Abaddon has special lines for denying himself with Mist Coil. This is the response rul for it  Response abaddon_DeathIsAbaddonCoilIsEnemyAbaddon  It specifies the dying hero (abaddon_Death) the killing ability (IsAbaddonCoil) and the killing hero (IsEnemyAbaddon). However it does not specify the alliance. ""Is*Ally*Abaddon"" would specify it to be an allied Abaddon and since allied Mist Coils only heal it automatically limits it to the caster.

Suggestion for Valve: Compendium app for TI8,self.DotA2,Hey so I know this probably won't see the light of day since it won't directly bring any money into Valve's pockets but I still think it's a good idea for several reasons so hear me out.          First of all I'm not talking about some sort of crazy book-type app or anything too all-encompassing but since TI started I realized there are a couple of actions I want to perform while watching a stream or while I'm away from my PC and I can't unless I start DotA 2 up. They're all actions relating to TI and I feel I shouldn't have to start the game-up to perform them.        1. **Checking/Setting my fantasy team.** There are a bunch of scenarios where you'd want to interact with your fantasy team while not near or at a PC. You're watching a stream and you want to check if your team has a player that absolutely slayed or if you forgot to put him in. You want to make that last minute change. You want to see how your team did the previous day during your morning work commute. The player cards are collectibles they stem from player stickers you used to put in a book (compendium) back in the day. I had those for at least 3 world cups (soccer). Given the nature of the cards I think it makes sense to give the player an option of viewing his collection at his convenience.       2. **Live match predictions.** This has been a conversation in the past but having the possibility of setting match predictions while watching the stream without having to start up your client that would be fantastic. Right now I am completely ignoring the predictions (aside from the fact that they're bugged) mainly because I am more comfortable watching the matches on my couch on my TV rather than slouched over my PC monitor. I know it's not the case for *everyone* but there must be a sizeable portion of the viewership that feel the same way. It's another quality of life improvement that would give the user more reason to watch and be engaged with the content.       3. **Checking my compendium level.** This is one that Valve might actually like because I think it would be actually incredibly convenient if you would be able to view  your compendium level the rewards **BUT ALSO** have the possibility to buy/increase your level directly from the app. This will pose some restrictions as I don't think it would be good UX to also recycle/open treasures but if you're 20 levels away from that sweet baby roshan then it is proven that mobile drives impulse buys anyway. This doesn't add **THAT** much value for the user but it's just that marketing/content pushing feature that would financially sustain the others.       4. **Check schedule standings etc. .** This is something that every tournament should have - easy access to the progress of the tournament. If you want to see what matches are next so you can decide if you want to stay up or go to bed or you want to check mid-game if EG lost their match (without switching streams) or just check the brackets so you have a better feel of the big picture you could do that without having to go on reddit or liquipedia just from the app.           I know that none of these are *must-haves* they're just some extra features that would give some not all users that extra something to feel like they're really valued as customers. There are a lot of examples out there of companion apps for tournaments or events Blizzard is an excelent example. They have apps for Blizzcon WCS WoW. Other conventional sports also offer companion apps. I'm not using them as examples to compell Valve to do this or to say that this is absolutely necessary just to prove that it's not a novel idea companies have done it in the past and there was no BAD press or BAD user sentiment following them.       Feel free to add your own suggestions these use-cases are just things I've personally felt I could benefit from.,suggestion
Valve for the love of God Let the community create custom AI for Bots,self.DotA2,When i started dota 1 nine years ago i had the privilege of practicing with AI Maps which were  amazing in their own regard given the limitations of Warcraft 3 engine. The official AI which was headed by Cloud_Str and PBM was and still is one of the best AIs in the Moba genre (probably better than the current dota2 bot)  This game has a very steep learning curve and it would definitely benefit from custom bot from the community.

Minimap shouldn't be tilted during pick phase,self.DotA2,When you are in the pick phase the minimap is slightly tilted backwards and it can be kinda hard to look at it when you're going to be the one last picking.

All Draft is sorely needed as a regular game mode,self.DotA2,We all know what's up whether it be techies or your personal opinion that current pub meta is unfun this game mode gives players the option for a way less frustrating and let's be honest a more fun game for those who would play it.  ### Here's how it would work.  a) A quick 15 seconds countdown to ban heroes _after_ which the bans are shown and the drafting proceeds like regular All Pick except some heroes are banned.  b) The bans are anonymous.  c) Every player gets only 1 ban.  d) You can't communicate during the banning period not with your team or the enemy team. You ban for yourself.  e) If you don't ban a hero it's just that. You don't actually  _have_ to ban anything.  f) If for example 5 people ban the same hero by accident (remember they can't communicate during the banning period) that hero is banned and there isn't much else to it.  ___  ###Points to consider:  1) The picking is more fluid and variable than All Pick - logically flavor heroes would be banned out more often shifting the pub meta perpetually making for more fun games.  2) You personally don't have to play against heroes you don't want to. This one is straightforward and benefits only YOU.  3) Captain's Mode is a pretty shit mode without a party of your own.  4) You don't even have to play it you're giving more options to those who would want them.  ___  #And we should repeat this all the time until it gets fucking implemented.  #It's important.

I think Valve should really change the After Party Broadcasting goal.,self.DotA2,1. Pros and personalities have already spoken: they want to relax and have fun after a week long of working hard and dont have to worry about their public images. Some of them even have flights to catch next morning why would they go to after party?  2. The after party is latenight West coast hour July 21st is a Monday too. Its the type of broadcast that not everyone would/could enjoy watching.  3. There are rumors about a 2nd after party being planned most likely being hosted by twitch like every other events. If people know this one will be broadcasted they just gona go to the 2nd one anyway.  4. I think there are much more creative features that Valve could give as a stretch goal instead of this broadcasting: extending battle bonus period after TI4 custom map supports pro players subscriptions mini games while queueing for matchmaking bi-weekly automated tournament system with items prize... So many things that would benefit the entire players based/compendium holders than just a broadcast party.,suggestion

Pick Sequence on ranked games should be 1 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 -1 similar to CM not the currently 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1 to even out the first pick/counter pick advantages.,self.DotA2,Compulsory required necessary text.   Also maybe add more bans? 2 per player in which 50% goes through.   Edit* For those saying to just play CM:  * In CM only 1 player on each team controls the pick and bans * I won't trust one random stranger to my hero choice specially cause that I usually don't go meta (I also play at SEA) * In CM you are guaranteed to have 5 bans * Nobody plays CM or RD at least in  SEA * CM pick phase is too long * The more ban's part is also to maybe offset those AFK ones I have games on which only 1 or 2 is nominated,suggestion

DotA Improvement Ideas 3.0,self.DotA2,"Yes your first thought was right: My hands itched but my favorite pornsite was unfortunately unavailable .  Two reasons have moved me to create this article on reddit. The first is that I have the feeling **r/DotA2** is used/read more than the **DotA 2 Developer Forum** especially from Valves side. * When you report a bug on the Developer Forum nothing happens. But when you post that bug on reddit all hell is breaking loose and the bug will be fixed in a wink.*  The second reason is to tell you a story a story about me: [**Tangos for Twitler**](https://www.gofundme.com/TangosforTwitler) *** The following article is also published in [**Valve's DotA 2 Developer Forum**](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=172873) *(recommended for better readability).*   *** ##**DotA Reborn Improvement Ideas 3.0** ***  I know that every new update can u-turn the DotA 2 Reborn Beta dramatically so I dont go into much detail in the matter of layout design color etc. I try to shape my suggestion so far that you can understand them. *** ###**1.0 Settings Menu** *** **1.1 Advanced Ability and Item Hotkeys _\*implemented\*_** *** Nowadays you see a lot of pauses in the early stages of the pro games followed by sentences like: *Pause please wrong config.*  A lot of players use different hotkeys for different heroes especially to change between normal cast and quickcast. For example when you play Lion you want to have your abilities *(Earth Spike Hex etc.)* and the item Blink Dagger on quickcast in order to react and blink faster. In the next game want to aim with your Meat Hook with Pudge or plant Land Mines with Techies so you have to switch your hotkeys back to normal cast.  >[Selection button for global and individual Hero Hotkeys.](http://i.imgur.com/QAhmE6U.png)  *** **1.2 Emoticons Settings and Emoticons Wheel** *** At the moment there are two ways to use emoticons in DotA 2:  + **_Window:_**  Open a window with icons *(emoticons)* and click on them. + **_Chat Code:_** Write a specific chat code such as *:salty:.*  Both will get awkward in the future if more and more emoticons will be released. The window with icons inside will grow and you have to scroll a lot. Also the Chat Code will get more complicated and unmemorizable for example :dac15_embarrass:.

So there is no reason for recommendation that early. *** **2.1 Friends** *** The DotA 2 Reborn Beta Friends Menu is divided into three sections:  * **_IN DOTA_** * **_ONLINE_** * **_OFFLINE_**  If you have a lot of friends the current kind of grouping is far to confusing because people change their nickname and avatar picture once in a while.  In Steam Friends you can assign tags to your friends to group them together and find them quicker. DotA 2 Reborn Beta should take the whole grouping/tagging system from Steam Friends.  >[Use tags and groups from Steam.](http://i.imgur.com/3bdlN7J.png)  *** **2.2 FEED** *** The FEED flow could be a problem if you have a lot active friends in DotA 2.

But at the end we have both player groups *(DotA and Custom Games)* under one umbrella and when they tryout the other game the perplexity will rise. * One server name for each location (game overlapping)!*  >[Servername dilemma.](http://i.imgur.com/PAHDJ0l.png)  *** **7.0 In-Game** ***  The in-game HUD is currently the same. *- Wait for first concept draft.*  *** **7.1 Hero Models** *** A couple of heroes require better model execution and texture quality. *- They lack detail they need love!*   >[Warning: The following image contain graphic content that can shock offend and upset!](http://i.imgur.com/jBKqfvB.jpg)  *** **7.2 Hero Ability Icons** *** DotA 2 has plenty Hero Ability Icon relicts from olden times.

Newer players took irreparable brain damage through the confusing information overload. They are still bedazzled today scarred for life and all they wanted were boots just boots  Sooner or later the in-game HUD will get retread so here is a little story Ive got to tell about a noob you know so well:  *Alfredo was a bear he wanted boots I swear. All he had to do was clicking on the filter button called shoe.*  >[Shop Panel with filter buttons.](http://i.imgur.com/8VTQVzk.png)  *** **7.5 Animated Portraits** *** From an outside perspective this section may be the most unimportant of all but sometimes its the little things in DotA 2 that make me happy.  In other words I *talk to the tree make friends with it.*  Bob Ross  Because *theres nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.*  Bob Ross   **Open letter from me to Mr. Tree:**  We are living in the 21st century we were allowed to go through 5 Internationals and we still have this rushed without love made portraits.  I want portraits not mug shots! One of the best-known and wise bush of all time that lived on top of a painter once said: *The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.*  Bob Ross  In the first instance you must keep in mind that the portraits here have more space to breath. They look even worse and constricted in-game when they are surrounded by the HUD.   **Portraits evolution - from zero to hero:**  If you want something boring just smack the hero in the middle of the frame. Bloodseeker is a great example of a hero portrait that feels cramped and crowded in the frame.  >[Bloodseeker.](http://i.imgur.com/LXBrrWx.png)  You can avoid this when you leave the right amount of space in front of the hero so that it feels more comfortable.  >[Abbaddon.](http://i.imgur.com/ijPVT63.png)  Abbaddon has more space in front of him but he looks sad and dishonorable. The solution: *Lower camera angle*. A lower camera angle will create a striking effect and the hero will seem important and heroic.  >[The force is strong _(low-angle shot)_.](http://i.imgur.com/wfZxCUe.png)  We the people look up to our hero Razor! Hail Razor! The lower camera angle is not the reason why we chose Razor here its because of the space. Space behind the hero creates tension in the portrait.  >[Razor.](http://i.imgur.com/Y3aKS2q.png)  Where space is there is a backdrop and where the backdrop is there is a story. Beastmasters backdrop tells us a story a story about nature and wood which Razors with lightning and storm also could.  >[Beastmaster.](http://i.imgur.com/uB6Hhp4.png)  Generally you should leave enough space above the heros head but not too much so as to fell lost in the frame. Lunas portrait does a lot of things right not all but enough to be the second best hero portrait. In particular the position of the hero. Luna is placed off-center which adds interest focus and dynamic.  >[Luna.](http://i.imgur.com/ZRgGcjV.png)  There is only one one portrait to rule them all or in soft and warm german words: **_MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FULFILLED!_**  >[Undying.](http://i.imgur.com/nr6S6Vv.png)  Undying is turned slightly to the left but the space is on the right. This gives the image some tension and makes you wonder what hes up to as it adds an air of mystery as well. Having one shoulder higher than the other looks less stiff. In general diagonal lines are infinity more interesting and have more flow than straight ones. Undying has enough space in front and behind him for a comfortable feeling. His backdrop tells a character supporting story and the low-angle shot creates a heroic look.  **Check list:**  * **Diagonal lines are more interesting _(if your hero can not do that pose naturally just create it with a camera tilt)_** * **Enough space _(in front behind left or right above head)_** * **Every backdrop tells a story** * **Golden ratio** * **Low-angle shot** * **Rule of thirds**  >[Undying.](http://i.imgur.com/HRzM1VM.gif)  Yes there are some exceptions like Gyrocopter Io and Techies. They need a different camera angle. But thats it.  >[Portraits in their highest form _art_:](http://i.imgur.com/Xl6x6oh.png)  *** **7.6 Barracks** *** Every now and than when you have just enough time to destroy one barracks:      Attack the meele barracks! ATTACK THE MEELE BARRACKS! No! Stop attacking the range barracks! *PING-PING-PING-PING* - GG we lost .  Much as Id like art. Art is not when you crap in the living room. A good design is not an end in itself. It should also support the clarity and intuitiveness of the game. The visual difference between meele and ranged barracks should be better developed.  >[Barracks.](http://i.imgur.com/jy42FrV.png)  **_Suggestions:_**  * **_Meele- and ranged-symbol engraved in the buildings._** * **_Meele- and ranged-banner on a flagpole at the buildings._**  For the audience the current layout of the barracks looks not as important as it should be. The barracks dont reflect their in-game importancy via their design they look ordinary particularly the dire ones. * New desings please!*  *** **7.7 Hero Selection UI** *** I never liked the default Hero Selection UI order. I prefer an alphabetical hero order.  For everybody that cant wait till the release of the new in-game HUD and prefers also an alphabetical hero order cause logic here is a quick healthy homemade recipe from my granny (RIP):  **Recipe of Alphabetical Hero Selection UI (All Pick):**  * **Total Time:** 3 min  * **Preparation:** 2 min  * **Copy & Paste:** 1 min * **Yield:** 111 heroes from A to Z * **Level:** [Luser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luser) friendly  **Ingredients:**   * **[A-Z.txt](http://s000.tinyupload.com/download.php?file_id=16357342574693131026&t=1635734257469313102699307)**  **Tools:**  * **[DotA 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/570/)** _(required)_ * **Working Potato** _(required)_ * **Monitor** _(recommended) - Easter professionals dont need one._ * **Keyboard** _(recommended)_ * **Mouse** _(recommended)_ * **Intellectual Organ** _(overrated)_  **Directions:**  * **Download [A-Z.txt](http://s000.tinyupload.com/download.php?file_id=16357342574693131026&t=1635734257469313102699307) and place it in: _""Steam\SteamApps\common\dota 2 beta\dota\cfg\layouts""._** * **Start the DotA 2 Client and join a game.** * **When you can select a hero press the CRTL button for _GRID VIEW_ then click on _CUSTOMIZE GRID_ and after this the _Import Layout_-button.** * **A new window with a list of layouts will open select _A-Z_ confirm it and finally press the _Save changes_-button.**   >[Hero Selection UI.](http://i.imgur.com/JfWUIud.gif) *** **7.8 Tango Buff Icon** *** When you eat a Tango by targeting wards or trees placed by Iron Branch the heal duration is doubled.

Even so the game got a lot of user-friendly in the recent past in terms of abilities/items/damage-interactions the next patch with massive changes waits around the corner and catapults you back to square one.  Recently when I want to understand some changes or interactions I catch myself abusing the *Demo Hero Option* because it is much faster and easier than the whole create-lobby-procedure.  What if can we transform *Demo Hero* with his limitations to a kind of Sandbox with more options? * Lets do it!*  *** **8.1 Map** *** Extend the Demo-Hero-Map with Creep Camps Runes and Roshan Pit.  >[Minimap of the Sandbox (advanced Demo-Hero-Map).](http://i.imgur.com/sx77klc.gif)  *** **8.2 Options Menu** *** If you want to explore some abilities/items/damage-interactions you are forced to use a lot of console commands and here is the rub:  Newer Players that could benefit the most from such an environment in terms of teaching themselves fast and easy basic knowledge of open questions lack the know-how to use console commands. *- More options results in less console commands.*  >[Current Demo-Options-Menu versus an example of a possible Sandbox Menu.](http://i.imgur.com/HeHxBFF.gif)  *** **8.2.1 Hero** *** You can level the selected hero *(includes enemy hero)* up and down by 1 Level when you click on the proper arrow-button.

The solution is to show a timestamp instead.  You can level Roshan up and down by 4 minutes when you click on the proper arrow-button.  If you click on the Roshan Kill Timer-button. A count up timer will start when Roshan takes damage and ends when he is dead.

Suggestion for a thematical rework of Chaos Knight's ultimate Phantasm,self.DotA2,As of now there are 2 spells which are basically Manta Style on steroids: Phantasm and Naga's Mirror Image. This suggestion is mainly to make one of them more unique and thematically fitting to the hero.  #If you are just here to see the suggestion here is a demo  ###[Video demo of the suggestion] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqcXOcAksW0)  ###[Image demo with red Phantasm illus and red death poof] (https://i.imgur.com/pW8I9Vc.jpg)  --- --- # For details continue reading  **Reasons for a change:**  1. It's one of 3 Mirror Image abilities. It has no real unique-ness 2. The ability is based on [the horsemen of the apocalypes] (https://dota2.gamepedia.com/media/dota2.gamepedia.com/6/66/Chaknight_ability_phantasm_02.mp3) so how about making it more thematically fitting 3. Phantasm illus are much more powerful than regular illus but visually look the same  **Current Phanasm:** **After** a half second clones of Chaos Knight appear **around Chaos Knight**. The clones appear like regular illusions and are **blue**. CK is invulnerable during the half second.  **Suggested Phantasm:** **Upon cast** the clones appear from portrals to **Chaos Knight's left and right sides** so that they stand in a row. The clones are still illusions but are **red**. CK and the illus are invulnerable for half a second until the portals disappear.  **Optional bonus:** After leaving the portals CK and his illusions charge forward for half a second (while invulnerable) so that it looks like storm out of the portals. Could be made to charge through cliffs and trees or use regular pathing/stop upon reaching a cliff/tree.  **Notes:** To change the spell as little as possible its current mechanics/traits are still present:  * The half-second invulnerability (and hiding) are still applied * It still disjoints projectiles on cast * It still applies a basic dispel on cast * It still resets targeting orders on CK and orders CK to stop * It still could be made to shuffle the clone's and CK's position (I didn't do this in my version) * It still could be made to spawn 1/2/3 + 50% chance of +1 clone (I just did 4 on each level) * The upgrade could be kept as well (although it would be weird but it already is a weird upgrade anyway),suggestion

A couple (hopefully) easy changes to the spectating experience that would help a lot with #productionvalue and observing in tournaments this season.,self.DotA2,"With the most hectic tournament season coming up since pretty much ever I figured it'd be a good time to make a compilation post about problems that *should be* easily fixable when it comes to spectating/observing. So let's take a quick look:  1. Cameraman feature in the lobby is unusable 2. ""Hold select hero to follow"" doesn't work when spectating 3. Camera randomly zooms in 4. Quick-jumping to a hero via number keys only works without smooth drag in use.  If anyone of you guys knows any workaround/fixes for those let me know I'd be very grateful for those. If not hopefully Valve can fix those.  ____  ### Cameraman feature (Important for Midas Mode!)  The camera feature is *nearly usable* right now for online tournaments. But the selection is the wrong way around: The caster follows the observer's camera but the selection (clicked hero courier tower etc) of the observer never is shown to the caster. It's the other way around!   **This is super important for Midas Mode!** I'd love to be able to remote-observe for Midas Mode but without the selection propagating it makes no sense at all sadly.  I can't stress this enough. This could enable new observers to come into the scene by observing for online tournaments without doing production and with casters being able to directly view their camera movement! And would improve overall online quality because someone like me could hop in for a game or two with no strings attached.  Of course I could be totally wrong here and it's very hard to fix this but everything works _only_ the selection needs to be swapped. It would be amazing if Valve could fix that. And in case this gets fixed I'll update my observing guide to explain this in detail how to use it and how it works.  ____  ### ""Hold select hero to follow"" doesn't work when spectating  Would be really cool if we could get this working or just get a separate hotkey to follow the currently selected unit. Currently you have to double click on the hero portrait (ODPixel does this all the time when he casts without observer) and it would be amazing if that could be fixed. It helps a lot with Ember Spirit jump outs Storm Spirit jump ins Monkey King movement etc.  ____  ### Camera Zoom-In  A personal pet peeve of mine. Ever since       dota_camera_zoom_return_to_default_time  is cheat protected there's no way to disable that and after the 30s the camera starts to zoom in. This is why sometimes observers (and casters) seem to jiggle up and down all the time. Because the game slowly zooms you in even if you are at the perfect height for that teamfight or skirmish.  There were a bunch of spectator commands made cheat protected a while back and somehow this got the axe even though it's entirely harmless and _really annoying_ when observing. I think that's the correct convar but it's a bit hard to test right now.  ____  ### Hero Quick Jump  Valve implemented the hero quick jump (pressing the number keys to directly select and then jump to a hero) but unfortunately it doesn't work when the smooth drag button is held (usually mouse 3). Would help a lot to select heroes in teamfights when it's important to use smooth drag over the assisted camera.  ____  That's about it!   Feel free to add anything that is relevant to you personally when spectating games in DotaTV while we're at it.  edit: If these things get fixed I'll observe Midas Mode promise <3",suggestion

They also didn't know about the balance changes. One could argue that they could see an update queuing in steam and investigate it's nature to find out about the patch and balance changes but there are still scenarios where people won't do this for example if they have auto-updates enabled and they updated without noticing or if they expect it to be some minor patch/economy updates instead of a major balance patch.

Valve please consider redesigning players profile page.,self.DotA2,"I remember my first impression when checking out the brand new Reborn was ""cool but the profile page looks so dull and unfinished they'll probably add some cool stuff soon to brighten it up though."" I was so convinced that the hero showcase would be later added with redesigned look and even more features and was looking forward to them but that only turned into disappointment.   It's been 2 years nothing new has been added. Remember when we had colorful and informative profile pages in the old game? Now it's as bland as the blackboard in my statistics class back in high school.  Reborn has taken so many features away from the profile page which was understandable at first since they introduced a new engine but why the heck did they just leave it there? However you look at the current profile page it's a major DOWNGRADE comparing to the old one:  * Profile picture has shrunk substaintially.  * You can no longer leave a status msg next to your name like ""dinner brb""  * Hero showcase completely removed which was a big part of old profile page and a lot of players really cared about it cuz it's where you can show off your most proud hero or your most amazing crazy cosmetics. They took it away. What occupies almost 40% of the page is now a radar chart for your recent performance which is ~~absolutely~~ next to useless and a list of statistics which isn't even accurate to begin with.   * You can only choose 2 from your solo mmr party mmr total matches played total wins etc. which were all displayed on one page before. Why? Is my profile page a friggin' trial version??? I understand that some people may not want to expose some of the information but isn't allowing the player to hide some of them a much better way to do this??? Imagine your facebook can only display 2 of your personal info like name gender hometown school employment status relationship status but not everything simultaneously. Like wtf?????   **EDIT:** I forgot to mention commends. Yes commendation is a thing but I cannot give one to the devs for abandoning the feature. What if you have accumulated a decent amount of commends and you are eager to show it but still want to display how long and how many matches you've played? You get triggered as you realize you can't do that and you upvote this post in a desperate attempt so Valve can hopefully see. Minutes ago I read another post that complained about how getting commended or commending someone else doesn't even feel enjoyable due to how obscure the feature is and nobody cares about it. Having the number of commends you've received directly displayed on your profile page could be a good way to start fixing the problem.  * You can only choose 3 from EVERYTHING to display and I can't believe they mixed cosmetic items and heroes together. Back then we had a customizable 2X4 grid for item showcasing and 3 automatically generated hero portraits sorted by your highest number of wins. I remember a few years ago someone suggested we get hero portraits with our own equipped cosmetics on the profile page and people were hyped about it being a possibility in the future. But Valve just made that future inaccessible by removing the feature completely. Why??????? wtf???????? It feels like I'm being punished for having spent a lot of money on cosmetics cuz I had a lot of items with dope effects and customized names and descriptions (which is another feature that barely exists anymore) and now I can only show 3 of them and on top of that while being unable to show which heroes I love to play.  * The status update/comment system that occupies half of the page. Like... it's a new feature alright but left unfinished. Unable to edit unable to delete. When I get a rampage or aegis snatch but don't really feel like showing it to everyone the game just gives me the middle finger as I'm helpless about it. What's even more frustrating is that only you can make a post on your page so your friends can't even leave messages for you which half defeats the purpose of the system already and you can only write text... like why can't you put a picture up there to show a funny moment of your recent game or something? It feels like my own profile page is actually a rental and I'm not supposed to do what I want.  **and for the love of god Valve please don't introduce compendium rewards that unlock hero showcase and more slots for player profiles. If you do I might get triggered off the face of the planet and die.**  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TL;DR - The current profile page sucks and deserves new features or at least the old features back.",suggestion

I think I know an aghs upgrade which could make Tiny a lot better than he is right now,self.DotA2,When Tiny gets Aghs give him a permanent tree so he doesn't have to use Tree grab to get a tree anymore. Maybe this isn't enough so I think Tree Grab should be replaced with a new ability called 'Craggy Exterior' but it balances out since he can't use tree toss anymore. Craggy Exterior will have a 25% chance of damaging melee attackers and stunning them and also gives armor considering he has no agility now. On the topic of armor he should also get some more agility back maybe about 9+(0.9 per level). I think this would be a good change to make Tiny stronger since he has such a low winrate right now. I don't think it's overpowered since you need to buy a 4200 gold item to get it. Thoughts?,suggestion

"Petition to add ""Void"" as a Faceless Void search string at hero select",self.DotA2,"In hero select sometimes it takes a while to agree with your team on picks/roles/etc. When that happens instinct takes over when picking your hero. I don't know how many people have the word ""Faceless"" pop up in their head before ""Void"" when talking about the hero. So what I'm proposing here is for Volvo to add ""Void"" as a search string for him so that people like me who are forced to find their hero in a split second don't get fucked over by their instincts and pick Venge.  As per /u/nmmgxx's suggestion: also add ""322"" for Rapira in shop. Ty based Volvo.  /u/AwesomeArab : ""Shaman"" for Shadow Shaman ""Demon"" for Shadow Demon ""Lancer"" for Phantom Lancer ""Shaker"" for Earthshaker.  /u/AdzR : ""Wyvern"" for Winter Wyvern.  /u/RapsiSoup : ""SF"" for Shadow Fiend.  /u/LuisArturo1024 : ""LC"" for Legion Commander.  /u/stopthatdude : ""Rub"" should go to Rubick instead of Nyx.  /u/otoninho : ""Maiden"" for Crystal Maiden.  /u/Sandusson : ""Druid"" for Lone Druid.  /u/mezz1945 : Maybe add a ""search stats"" option?

Dear Valve the lack of a Social Construct in Dota2 is making me slowly stop playing plz help,self.DotA2,"I dont want to stop playing dota... but I am a social creature.  I dont want to play alone I dont want to only have the option to solo que. I want to play with ""friends"" like minded people.  I am getting up in the years and Dota has always been my game but since there is no in game social construct like a Guild the only people I play with are good steam friends and real life friends.  But people get lifes (read kids) and stop playing and no one new starts playing I have tryed but the curve is to hard people dont want to put the effort into the game.  So my only option is to befriend random people from my pubs and play with them... I have tryed that and it has not worked out...   We need Guilds in game guild with in game objective to bind you together. Like guild quest or something similar... plz Valve the game needs this its such an easy fix for so many of the issues.  Dota2 is without a doubt of my mind the best MOBA out there I know I have tryed the others (because now my friends are playing them) Dota2 is the best GAME ! but... its hard... and with no social construct to help you....   Plz Valve I dont want to stop playing but I feel myself starting to be one of the people that only watches dota but does not play it.

Suggestions to Rubick's personality,self.DotA2,"I was playing Rubick the other day i said something like that: There's none who cannot be mimic"" and an idea came to my mind.  Rubick should say other hero's lines. For example when Rubick steals Pudge's hook when Rubick uses it he should say: ""Look who's comming for dinnah"" or ""Oy fresssh meat""(we all know rubick speak like that: Dinnah or usually speak a bit slow*Fressh).   Imagine he kills Invoker and he says one of his lines: You die as you lived: insipid and ignorant. and then laughts at you. or at least if he uses sunstrike Rubick should say the name of the skill when casting it.  One of thing i love of Dota is the voice system i think it still can be improved(but i still love it never get tired of it)",suggestion
Can we please get better tree hitboxes?,self.DotA2,I know that this was already posted several times but for me this is one of the most annoying things in the game.    At this moment 2 of the top posts are great tree jukes as a well executed tree juke is something that is amazing to watch.   However at this moment tree juking might get really difficult because sometimes it is nearly impossible to click on the tree you want to cut. And if you are using quickcast you can't even see that you are cutting a different tree than the one your cursor is above. Take a look at these few examples:   * http://sendvid.com/jlz1c0l8  (this one is made by me  sorry for the low quality but I think the point is more that clear)  * https://gfycat.com/NippyWelllitBandicoot by u/veega   * http://puu.sh/oY6ZE/ae8e54b740.jpg by u/marlan_   * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QqJ0Oo-yAQ by u/jaspermyyyy    I think it is clear that the tree hitboxes are far from being perfect fixing them would make the game more enjoyable and hopefully we'd see even more tree jukes such as the Zai's one.  EDIT: Thank you whoever at Valve reacted to this post and tried to improve the hitboxes. I can't check how much of an improvement it is at the moment but just seeing them acting so quickly makes me happy.,suggestion
Winter Wyvern should be allowed to use Splinter Blast on allies,self.DotA2,It makes sense since splinter blast won't damage primary targets  Will definitely make WW viable again just a slight buff that can be useful in certain situations  Please volvo  Edit: thanks for the response guys. I do see how it can get overpowered. We can maybe reduce the blast damage or the aoe of the blast so that it wont be too op then ww will be perfect again  Edit 2: oh my god i didnt expect this to get to the top of r/dota2.

Custom Game creators: Please add information such as game length recommended numbers of player team size PvE or PvP etc. to the description of your game,self.DotA2,Please! Most custom games are missing most of these information. I haven't seen one custom game yet that offers all these information in the description.  When I am alone and want to play a custom game but only have limited time I want to know what's the expected length of your game or at least some range. I also want to know if I my leaving would cause other players to lose the game or whether leaving is not an issue.  When I am playing in a stack I would like to know whether it's PvP or PvE how big the team size is etc. so it's easier to find a new and fitting custom game.

I love watching pro DOTA. But ESL you made it hard me. Here's some honest criticism.,self.DotA2,"I love watching DOTA especially professional level games. I've been to 2 TIs watch every major and most of the minors but this one is a huge fucking challenge. A lot of people are giving ESL shit for selling out to Facebook. This is actually a shame because I'm sure the production for the event is stellar (Though I wouldn't know because I've yet to see the official stream) but there is some legitimate criticism buried in all the random hate for Zuckerberg. This is my attempt at giving ESL constructive criticism:  * Lack of advertising. I had no idea where the stream was being hosted. I'm on Facebook daily but I never saw an ad or any other article that would actually link me to the streams so that I could watch. The only place I've been able to find a stream link is in the stickied Reddit threads which is fucking laughable.   *  Awful time zones and complete lack of a schedule. I'm in -6 GMT and I tried to find when the games started. They showed up as starting ""13 hours from now"" on JoinDota up until the moment that they started. So even if I wanted to watch I would have had no idea when to tune in. They finally ended up starting at 1 AM or something late but doable if I would have been able to prepare myself.  * Awful mobile support. I think I probably speak for a sizable number of people who watch or listen to streams or vods on their smartphone while working. I still don't know if there are vods of yesterday's broadcast because the shit tier Facebook stream is using Flash instead of an HTML5 player that I might be able to watch on my android phone. Meanwhile I can open the Twitch app and have instant 1080p 60fps streams (or whatever quality really) on my phone hassle-free.   * Nasty response to secondary streams. Personally I don't give a shit about you guys using facebook over twitch assuming that I can: Easily find the stream watch it on my phone watch it at a reasonable time of day. The secondary streams on twitch have made that at least somewhat possible in a very amateurish way. But you guys shouldn't be pissy twats to the various twitch streamers because Facebook offered you a pile of money to essentially broadcast over the IPTV streaming equivalent of AM radio.  Hopefully this reaches the people its meant for because I really do usually enjoy ESL events. But not when they're impossible to find hard to enjoy because of timezones/limited rebroadcasts and ultimately just plain difficult to watch. ",suggestion
Valve can we have Prime too.,self.DotA2,"I'm sure most or atleast some of you know of Valve's method of making players happier in CS:GO matches Prime Matchmaking. For those of you who don't it's simple you attach your phone number which in most cases are things you don't have several of or don't get new ones too often to your account and this becomes your ""main"" you get matches playing with others in Prime and if you get vac banned or something of the sort you can't rejoin Prime Matchmaking.   Now we all know the vac thing would be next to useless since valve has yet to vac ban people using scripts or hacks but in the meantime before the ban wave we are waiting for people don't need to play with bot accounts and people who buy them.  What u/slow4flo has said in his comment is what came to mind when I thought of this being added. Account levels are practically useless right now less than commends and putting it to use with something  like this might help. Keep in mind though this is for ranked only while also isn't a requirement most bots and scripter accounts don't even bother with unranked from what I know and I'm not even sure Prime in CS GO works for casual so nothing would change there for the most part so for those I've seen talking about playing mostly unranked wouldn't be affected by even que time. One issue I can think of right now is how botted accounts could probably que with each other easier due to not being prime but this is just an idea that COULD no guarantees help with the issues of abusing the ranked system.  Also if u/SirActionSlacks- could think of some crazy idea it would probably be better than anything Volvo could think of.  TL;DR : Valve add prime matchmaking AND VAC BAN PEOPLE ALREADY.  edit: spelling and additions ",suggestion

A Plea for Professionalism at TI4 from ESPORTSREP,self.DotA2,Dear Reddit community  First of all I would like to offer a preemptive shoutout to Kaci Aitchison for her amazing hard work and dedication at TI4. Last year the goddess Kaci barely got any recognition for doing her job properly so I think we the Reddit community should change that this year. I encourage all of you to post as many Shoutout threads as possible to demonstrate our community's never-ending love and affection for such a beautiful woman  she is a fantastic role model for my 9 year old daughter Alexa.  Now we are in the midst of the largest and most influential event in the history of sports. This is our moment to make a lasting impression on the world at large. We must prove to everyone that Dota is not a video game but rather a spectator sport featuring world-class professional cyber-athletes. However as we all know there are a number of toxic players who do everything in their power to tarnish the professionalism and integrity of Dota. Inspired by a great US senator of the 1950's I have formed a list of these players whose unprofessionalism threatens the view of esports in the mainstream eye:  * iceiceice  Last year iceiceice was uncooperative when interviewed by the goddess Kaci and Alexa's TI experience was completely soiled by the talk of iceiceice's unprofessional bowel movements.  * mason  You cannot spell ignoramus without this player's name. It is of course not at all surprising that a North American brute like mason is a blight on the scene but it is a problem nonetheless. Earlier this year mason engaged in an act of racism against the African American community by likening the opposing team to apes. In doing so he is responsible for setting the civil rights movement back at least 40 years. * Arteezy  Another North American scumbag whose arrogance and smug superiority threaten to put off mainstream viewers should he happen to be graced by an interview with the goddess Kaci. Interviews at TI4 ABSOLUTELY MUST be scripted like in regular sports in order to get more TV time and publicity. For instance Richard Sherman's world class professionalism in front of the camera is largely responsible for the success of American football as a spectator sport. We cannot afford to have young hot-headed players like Arteezy saying anything cocky in interviews or esports are destined to fail. * EternalEnvy  Having once made an offensive comment to someone in a pub game over a year ago and more recently having refused to shake Loda's hand at ESL One EE poses a great threat to the integrity of esports. Moreover his love for anime is most likely to be frowned upon by the mainstream. His awkwardness might also make Kaci slightly uncomfortable which is something that must be prevented at all costs. * Hao  Although I myself speak no Chinese I heard from someone who also does not speak any Chinese that Hao was cheering for teams other than DK during the group stages. This is easily indisputable proof that Hao is a disgusting racist. In this community we value professionalism so highly and try our best to have our eSports community be as professional as possible. These few people like Hao who are blessed by us (the community the people watching and supporting the teams) to be given the chance to do something they love for a living can't even get themselves to respect their brothers and help the Dota 2 community's image. It is absolutely appalling.  In order to keep an eye on these players (and others I am sure I have missed there being too many to keep track of) I have formed the Tydehunter committee and appointed my daughter Alexa as the head. The Tydehunter committee will be responsible for hunting down the cyber athletes listed above who attempt to tarnish the good name of esports and Dota 2. The goddess Kaci must not be exposed to insolent behavior on the part of these young hooligans. As a news reporter for a large company she has probably never experienced anyone being awkward in front of her which I fear is an enormous risk for her holiness at TI4. Much like Asians women are delicate creates that we as Redditors are sworn to protect. The goddess Kaci especially is a professional lady who must be defended at all costs from the tyranny of these young men.  Thank you.,suggestion

To the people complaining that Envy is asking for donations to buy stuff for his team. I have a question.,self.DotA2,What's wrong about that?  He's using his own fucking donation money (which he has been collecting long before this) to cover the cost for his new team now perhaps until they actually gets sponsors and tournament prize winnings.  He could have easily kept quiet and funneled the current donations he is receiving to his team and nobody would care. The only difference now is that he's actually transparent enough to announce where the money is headed towards and there's a problem?   He's already asking for donations anyway why is attaching a reason to it so bad? Would people rather he keep quiet about how he's spending the donation money? Or are people upset that he's using donation money instead of his and his teammates's money to cover cost for equipment? If that's the case what's the difference between using his own money and money that he got through donations which is also his own money?  I'm just really perplexed why people are complaining,question

It's lie a legit mystery to me how slacks is about to get 5k. I'm not flaming; I'm actually just curious. He obviously deserves it because he won enough games. But how did he do it?,self.DotA2,He's about to get 5k. Period. He earned it. It's obviously not random. The question is rather how he gets it.   For example right now he's playing Disputer. He didn't ward at all early game even though the enemy has a roaming bounty hunter (so his mid is fucked). He pulled about 4 camps in lane early game and somehow got 2 cs from doing it 4 times (like how is that even possible?). It's He let his carry die in lane and then proceeded to passive aggressively flame him for a bit. Then he went bot and feed the enemy Slark. He rushed soul ring and used it twice by minute 12. His skill bill was maxing Q then W then E. (He didn't have any points in E when he used his Ulti first time). He uses zero hotkeys for items. He literally clicks on the item portrait. His item build was to rush Ghost vs tide WW slark bounty. Whenever he farms a lane of creeps he tends to only get 1 or 2 cs out of the wave.   I honestly think it's cause he spams Omniknight and people don't want to be salty in front of dota celeb.   edit: rofl he banned me from his channel for criticizing his play.,question

Why do Prowlers HAVE to stomp?,self.DotA2,All other creeps except for the dinosaurs do not cast their abilities unless there are a total of 3 heroes or summons in their aggro range. Centaurs Hellbears Dragons they're all chill creeps. They don't fuck your clarities or reduce your amor by 5 million and poes you for half your life.   You can make the argument that only scrubs get rooted as you can easily dodge the stomp by kiting them and you'd be right. What fucking gets me is that you can accidentally walk too close to them on your way somewhere else and the bastards would root you just for the hell of it.   What do you guys think? Change their rules to be the same as other creeps? Add an RNG factor so they sometimes stomp sometimes not? Downvote this post and comment git gud?,question

Is this an intended game mechanic? (Legion Commander vs Meepo),self.DotA2,"Was playing as LC and saw a Meepo (let's call him M1) about to die.  So I boost over to the nearest Meepo (M2) I could find to squeeze in a duel.  M1 dies while M2 was being duelled meaning *all* Meepos died while one of them was being duelled.  But I got no damage or ""Winner"" message.  For every other hero the mechanic is ""if killed while in a duel damage goes to other hero"".   Given that all versions of Meepo are treated as a full hero (even in terms of EXP earned) it seems counter-intuitive to make this lone exception for duels.   Surely this is just a (fairly major) bug?? ",question

What should you expect from Virtus Pro?,self.DotA2,"I've made some research on vp and i want to share with you guys what i found out.   **They don't value (or valued) CM nearly as much as other T1 teams**  Pretty much every top tier 5 position in their last 50 games has cm as one of their 3 most [picked heroes](https://1drv.ms/x/s!ArCBdVoOzsc7mUhzy6fNUjymXwQA) . A lot of people consider VP a very aggressive team and at the same time people considered the meta ""aggressive"" . One of the reasons people attributed to the higher tempo was crystal maiden yet vp was able to consistently achieve good results ignoring the hero. I'm not sure I can really explain why they don't like it . The best i can give you guys is that most of the time since solo dies a lot and goes for very deep wards/plays it makes more sense to give him a hero that has big skills and needs 0 items. Warlock and Disruptor are heroes that have very high impact and range allowing him to be relevant even with 10 deaths. Quite different from cm.   **They are probably the kings of courrier sniping**  There's no website that allows you to get the data on courrier sniping (at least that i'm aware of) . Even then when you think about it currently it's hard not to think about vp. I asked @noxville about it and he made his own [research](http://imgur.com/a/0c633) .  **While everyone praises no[o]ne and Ramzes lil and 9pasha are way more targeted by bans**  Dark seer Wisp and Magnus are by FAR the biggest heroes targeted by other teams. When you have allies as skilled as virtus pro  the ability to enhance their performance can be overwhelming to other teams and this is why i feel like most t1 teams usually have an io player (and amazing cores). While magnus is heritage from the old magnus patch dark seer is still fairly often a first [phase ban against VP](https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/teams/1883502/counters?date=3month). Another fairly often ban target is ursa. During the kiev majors the no[o]ne ursa mid was a very strong tool in their good run during the tournament and a lot of people still go for the ban. It's a good pick because one of [ramze's 3 most picked heroes](https://1drv.ms/x/s!ArCBdVoOzsc7mUhzy6fNUjymXwQA) include ursa giving a lot of versatility to the team since not many teams have mid and carry players that can swap their heroes besides juggernaut.     **Even though VP has amazing results in the last months Solo has the lowest gpm of every t1 5 support and one of the highest death avgs**  A lot of people comment on it. The way solo plays is very bold. He will go for aggresive wards and moves and a lot of times he doesn't care about dying (at least it seems like it ) . The fact he has so many high skilled players in his team (and thus greedy players) works very well with that type of support player. If he was too careful or scared someone will be eventually a target of key spells timings and smoke ganks. This stat backs up my view on why vp doesn't really like cm all that much. The hero has no way to compensate for a lot of deaths and doesn't scale only with levels (like disruptor/warlock). That's not really the case for rubick but if you pay attention to the [stats](https://1drv.ms/x/s!ArCBdVoOzsc7mUhzy6fNUjymXwQA) most of the time solo has way less deaths on rubick than other heroes.   *Avg deaths on Disruptor:* **5**   *Avg deaths on Warlock:* **4**   *Avg deaths on Rubick:* **3**   **They are actually dota hipsters**  With the exception of [newbee](https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/teams/1375614/picks?date=3month) [vp](https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/teams/1883502/picks?date=3month) is one of the only teams in the world that ban so much treant . Part of it is because vp don't play the hero so much but also because they value some heroes highly that other t1 teams do [eg](https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/teams/39/picks?date=3month) [liquid] (https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/teams/2163/picks?date=3month) [secret] (https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/teams/1838315/picks?date=3month) [IG] (https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/teams/5/picks?date=3month). None of these teams pick a lot of either Ursa Jugger troll or svenand they have in them pushing power roshan taking and are melee heroes that get kited. Treant works very well against them because he can scout roshan heal towers and root everyone (even through bkb).   I know a lot of the stuff here can seem ""simple"" and that was my intent with the research and video. I want to dip most people that don't play a lot of dota or don't understand competitive in what every t1 team is about.   **I made a [video about the info here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsAk49iXalw) this is my first [crowdfund](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/i-want-bowie-to-make-content-for-ti7-in-seatle-games) ""rewards"" video .

Announcer Packs rotting in the workshop...,self.DotA2,"Ok so I am puzzled. Among the 30 which are visible there are a couple announcer packs submitted to the workshop which are actually quite entertaining. Some have been sitting there for years - collecting virtual dust and were not added to the game.  Does Valve just not care to use anything which does not already have a massive following from other games/TV shows etc? The announcer packs which are accepted/available to purchase are nearly all voices from heroes in Dota 2 other games and TV shows.  I ask this because I am a professional opera singer/actor/narrator. I am considering creating a pack for Dota 2 because I love the game... however I am not going to spend dozens or hundreds of hours writing/recording/editing/mastering 400-600 audio files plus create a spreadsheet... if it's not even going to have a chance of making it into the game because it's not already a recognizable/copyrighted/licensed voice from an existing piece of media.  Does anyone have anything useful to say regarding this? Would love to create something fun and entertaining for the game but don't want to just waste my time if it's got a huge chance of just rotting in the Workshop without Valve listening to/looking at it.  *EDIT*  The announcer pack I want to create is: Two dragons - brothers both redneck/southern and using all kinds of ""tasteful"" body/toilet humor.

Today we played with a 44-winstreak stack. They appear to be gaining too much assist gold. Is this an exploit?,self.DotA2,"**UPDATE: I think the most likely explanation is a bug in dotabuff's assist gold reporting. Since this got so much attention I've emailed dotabuff support asking them to chime in. (If anyone remembers the dotabuff admin's reddit username PM them this thread!)**  ===  Please check my arithmetic but I believe at least one member of this 5-stack could be using some sort of gold exploit. The stack had a 44-winstreak victory shout which seemed highly unusual.   Here is an example game: http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1290564153  Click the Dotabuff+ ""Kills"" tab and look at the Timbersaw player's Kill and Assist gold.     | # | Gold earned ---|---|---- Kills | 18 | 5709 Assists | 14 | 10215  Timbersaw earned over 10k gold for receiving 14 assists.  * Maximum assist gold occurs when only 1 hero is present and is computed by **40 + (7  Dying Hero's Level) + (0.05  Dying Hero's Net Worth  Net Worth Difference)**  * In this game Dire led gold advantage the entire game so there is no rubberband term in assist gold payout.  * The highest level radiant player was level 19.   Thus the theoretical maximum amount of gold for an assist is 40 + (7  Dying Hero's Level)  = 40 + (7 * 19) = 173.   &nbsp;  For the sake of argument pretend Timbersaw assisted against a level 19 hero for all 14 of his assists. Then his gold would be 173 * 14 = **2422**. But his actual assist gold is **10215**.  &nbsp;  It appears that in this game this player received many times more assist gold than he should have. There are many other example games in the player's game history which show the same pattern of an inflated assist gold value.  Moreover at least one of the players in this stack was VAC banned according to this [VAC ban checker](http://www.vacbanned.com/engine/check). The player is: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198069064596  These five players seem to play almost exclusively together.  &nbsp;  **Did I make an arithmetic error? Is there a bug with dotabuff's assist gold reporting? Is there some sort of new exploit related to assist gold?**",question

Team Unknown mid player intentionally throwing? [maybe match fixing?],self.DotA2,"Anyone watching this game between Team Unknown and Pain Gaming for The Summit AM can see that the mid player (""sad boy"") for unknown is not taking the game seriously at all. For starters his item progression was brown boots -> brown boots -> ghost scepter as a mid shadow fiend and then he's doing really obviously throwy stuff like TP'ing in to the middle of 5 players only to insta die and cancelling his requiem in spots where it would be really good to let it go off.   It really ruins pro dota when players don't take matches seriously. I was an unknown fan after watching them play during the frankfurt major qualifiers but this is putting a sour taste in my mouth.   I really wonder if there is some sort of match fixing going on given how big of favourites they were going in to this match - obviously there isn't enough evidence to say that for sure but I think it's worth looking into.  Not to take anything away from how Pain gaming are playing - they're obviously playing very well. And the rest of Team Unknown also seem to be trying really hard to win. It's just their mid player that seems to be trying his hardest to lose the game for the team.  edit: in game 3 just now he's playing QoP and bought two blink daggers o_0",question

Rubick stealing the reworked PA dagger,self.DotA2,So I just played a game as Rubick and whenever I stole PA's dagger I noticed that when I threw it (to start with just at her) I wasn't doing any damage.

I then tried it on a creep and it does 0 damage. It still applies the slow and I would guess any orb effects (though I didn't have any so I can't confirm) but the damage portion of the spell simply does not copy over.  This has to be a bug right?,question

Attack Speed vs Damage - What Should I get?,self.DotA2,"Tl;dr: All things being equal you want exactly 100 more damage than increased attack speed (IAS) in order to maximize right click DPS. This means the sword icon (attack damage) and hand icon (total attack speed) in the UI should be equal (Thanks /u/GodsFaithInHumanity).  I have always wondered about the relationship between increased attack speed (IAS) and damage. I would occasionally go through the math for a specific case to figure out if I want damage or increased attack speed in order  to maximize raw auto-attack DPS.   I got tired of doing this so I finally did some number crunching and made an interesting discovery *you want exactly 100 more damage than increased attack speed in order to maximize raw right-click DPS*. Obviously there are many other factor to consider when deciding which item to buy but this is a great piece of information to take into account.  So for example if you have 300 damage and 150 IAS a point of IAS is more valuable than a point of damage. If you have 300 damage and 200 IAS its a wash a point of IAS is equal to a point of damage. If you have 300 damage and 250 IAS then damage is better.   Just how much better is it? Consider a level 25 Dragon Knight with Armlet BKB Daedalus and BOTs. Taking into account his likely talents we get 326 damage and 116 IAS with Armlet on so obviously we want to bump up that IAS. The 55 IAS from a 2k gold Hyperstone would increase DPS by 105 whereas 46 Damage from 2.4k gold Demon Edge would only increase DPS by 58. That is 19 gold per DPS vs 41 gold per DPS. Over twice the value! Pretty significant if you ask me.  Considering how cheap AS is compared to damage and how often your damage can greatly surpass your AS I think AS is often the way to go to maximize damage especially for strength or int carries who dont get AS from their primary attribute. So basically - buy more Mjollnirs.   *Math:*  APS = attacks per second  DPS = damage per second  IAS = Increased attack speed  D = Attack damage  BAT = base attack time    1.)	DPS = APS * D  2.)	APS = ((100 + IAS) .01)/BAT  3.)	Thus DPS = (D + (.01)IAS*D)/BAT  EDIT: Attack speed reduces attack point animation by the same factor so it does matter even for 1 attack. It can easily be the difference between getting the attack off or not getting two vs one three vs two etc... It just isn't true to say you have to stand there and right for a few seconds for attack speed to matter.  Also if it wasn't clear in the post obviously your hero's spells need to be considered first. And what the item does is vital too. This is just one small piece of the puzzle. More of an ""all things being equal"" consideration.  EDIT2: I changed attack speed to increased attack speed (IAS) in the post. So you want damage and total attack speed which is 100 + IAS to be the same.",question
I had a 2:50:00 game end suddenly with neither ancient dying and both teams with active players. Why did this game end?,self.DotA2,"https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3857451448  Some people abandoned throughout the game and the techies team stalled for a bit to try and March of the Valkyries down mid and sneak attack mines from the trees. At the end only Sniper and Riki on radiant and Techies and Death Prophet on dire were still playing.  I'm really confused about why this game ended any insight or knowledge?  edit: [Here is the screen caps of the combat log at the very end.](https://imgur.com/a/sUFcvnM) Just after the ancient starts to explode there's red text at the top that says ""The game server is attempting to send match results to the game coordinator...""",question

I just played versus someone with 6k+ games that was using a script to instantly cast spells and when I try to view the replay from player perspective the camera is sat back away from his hero.

I was going to upload a gif of him using the script because it's a joke that someone has used it for 6k games and still not been banned but when I view the replay from his perspective the camera is permanently off-centre so I'm unable to even see what he's doing.

What happened to weather effects?,self.DotA2,They look just so much worse than they used to. I remember absolutely loving my moonbeam weather I used it all the time in source 1 and even the early days of source 2. It gave the map a lot of vibrance and new colors and even a whole new feel. Now it feels like nothing more than a purple filter with some sparkles thrown around the place. [You can see the difference very clearly here](http://i.imgur.com/g4bdtMD.jpg) this is a comparison between the source 1 moonbeam and the current one.

Friends got assessed with abandons for babysitting our open throne against a Wisp backdoor threat. What to do in these situations?,self.DotA2,Here's the match on dotabuff: http://dotabuff.com/matches/806090496  The other team had a very hard-hitting Weaver and Legion + Wisp that could easily backdoor our ancient if we didn't have at least a couple guys to defend. The unfortunate part was that we had mega creeps so the lanes were constantly pushed in our favour so they wouldn't be in range of their creeps dying for EXP (we didn't find out until after the game that AFK abandon is determined by 5 minutes without EXP since we never afk-abandon games and we hadn't encountered this problem before).   I doubt there's a way to 'appeal' to have an abandon revoked but I just wanted to bring attention to the fact that someone who is playing to win and not AFK can be inaccurately assessed an abandon under the current system. Kind of shitty to find out that after 86 minutes of a stressful game it didn't even count as a win for them. ,question

Gabe Newell just gave a presentation at my university and he touched on Dota 2 a few times. I recorded part of it and I was wondering if there would be any interest in me posting it.,self.DotA2,Hey guys  So Gabe Newell just came down to the University of Texas at Austin where I attend and [gave a talk](http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2013/01/28/gabe-newell-on-productivity-economics-political-institutions-and-the-future-of-corporations-29th-january-university-of-texas/) concerning the economics and direction of Valve and where he thinks that they their games and their entire industry is going. He spent a little time talking about a few things Dota 2 releated such as his reflections on Na'vi (specifically Dendi) its future in eSports and even an explanation for why they instituted the privacy settings in response to Dotabuff's DBR.  It would take me a little while to edit so I just want to see if people would like to hear about it so I know whether or not to go through the trouble.  **EDIT:** Here's a photo I took from my seat 10 feet away from him: http://imgur.com/z2UAdLm  **EDIT 2:** I'm getting a lot of messages in my inbox saying this was a stupid thread and a blatant karma-whoring attempt so let me explain: Since most of the presentation was about Valve's corporate economics and Gabe's reflections on the future of gaming Dota 2 was NOT the main focus of the talk (even though it did come up). Because of that I was afraid I might be breaking the subreddit rules by not being relevant -- hence why I posted this. As for the karma-whoring this is a self-post on a throwaway account for that very reason. Sorry for making this more difficult than it had to be. I'll start working on it.  **EDIT 3:** I contacted the people in charge to ask if it would be alright for me to post what I had recorded to Reddit and they weren't exactly... encouraging. In order to avoid potential legal repercussions to myself I'm currently working with them to figure something out and I think you will all be pleased with the solution in the end. Don't worry: OP will deliver.  **EDIT 4:** [Here you go.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/17nyw9/as_promised_here_is_the_presentation_gabe_newell/),question

When Jorge Bot can't land an Earth Spike to save his life I threaten to run down mid. I make fun of their item choices spam them with pings steal their farm and just generally act like a toxic asshole.

Go play WoW if you want to just grind creeps all game and play solo I mean what the fuck. We need your help in a teamfight and your sitting in the jungle at level 12 30 minutes in.

Newbee Young match fix? 22.07.16,self.DotA2,"Ok so I''ll lead with this I don't have any proof only suspicions.  **I came across some weird odds when betting on Pinnacle. They seemed to good to be true and they probably were. These two games were played today 22.07.16 in VPGame PRO League**  * Game 1. Newbee.Y vs Braveheart.Z   Newbee.Y is an established team ranked 30 globally. Braveheart.Z is ranked 100+ and barely played a single professional game Newbee.Y should be huge favourites.  Other books list Newbee.Y @1.40~ vs Braveheart.Z @3.00~. On Pinnacle odds start at Newbee.Y @3.00 vs Braveheart.Z @1.40 . Up untill match start the odds continue to shift in favour of Braveheart.Z ending somewhere around **Braveheart.Z @1.10 Newbee.Y @7.00+**  * Game 2. Newbee.Y(again coincidence?) vs FTD.C  FTD.C  are listed as small favourites on the other books. Roughly FTD.C @1.5~ vs Newbee.Y @2.5~.  The teams have almost the exact same global rank.On pinnacle odds start at Newbee.Y @ 3.5 vs FTD.C @1.3 but again the odds rapidily change in the last hour before game start. Odds at close are **FTD.C @1.1 vs Newbee.Y @8+**    **Odds never change like this in pro matches which is suspicious on it's own. That they only change on Pinnacle and remains the same on every other book is even more weird. The only reason the odds changed like this is because someone has made huge bets on these teams and continued doing so even when given terrible odds. It's extremely unlikely that someone would do this without fishy insider information**  So what were the results of the games? Without surprise Newbee.Y lost both. They didn't obviously throw but played passive in both games and made no attempt to defend when Braveheart.Z and FTD.C pushed highground.  If anyone have anything to add to this please do so. I have a really weird feeling about these games  * ***PS. Pinnacle seems to be suspicious of the situation as well the bets on game 2 have yet to be settled hours after the game ended. I really don't think it's a coincidence they probably noticed a lot of abnormal betting patterns***  *Update 23.07.16* Woke up this morning and logged in to Pinnacle. In the message box I received the following message regarding match 2:  * *""[E Sports] [Dota 2 - VPGame Proleague] [Match] Newbee Youth vs FTD Club C. Your bet with ticket-ID: 616564741 616582363 has been refunded. All bets taken have been refunded due to the following reason: [Abnormal and suspicious betting activity has been detected for this event. All wagers from all customers have been cancelled. This action is taken very rarely and is for the protection of all our customers.] .""*  Sounds like a pretty good confiramtion to me and I'm really happy that Pinnacle did this. It proves that they care about e-sports and most of all their customers. Of course I wish they would do the same thing with game 1 but I understand that's probably a lot harder since the bets on game 1 were settled immediatly after match end ",question

I went from average 110 fps on a single area to average 40 fps ( without march ) just by spamming Tinker's March nonstop for 3 minutes on practice. Why does the performance get so much worse the longer the game goes?,self.DotA2,https://i1.someimage.com/mEyxaRX.jpg  https://i1.someimage.com/RWJWA0m.jpg  This is reproducible very easily and fast just by enabling free spells and spamming a particle heavy spell.  If I create a new game the fps becomes normal again but the more marchs are casted inside a single game the worse the average fps gets even outside those areas.  There is something wrong with some of the particles management on this game and this is per spell / hat basis I think. Maybe there are even hats or spells that aren't released when each game ends ( processing use ).  ,question

Why do ppl leave in All Random?,self.DotA2,I don't really get this: lately more ppl seem to insta leave in all random if they get a hero they don't want to play.  1) There is repick - I'm not sure why ppl don't use that option. Yes you lose gold - so what? It still is worth a shot. Maybe you get lucky and can play a hero you already know.  2) You can swap. Often other players aren't happy with their heroes either so simply communicate and try to find someone who wants to swap.  3) If no one wants to swap simply give it a try. There is always a good chance enemy team doesn't know how to play their heroes either.  4) If you are not up for this why even select fucking ALL RANDOM?  ,question
'Courier Deliver Items' and 'Deliver Items from Stash' have a pass range but if I shift-queue it the courier walks up to 0 range to the hero - why?,self.DotA2,"So basically when I use hotkeys to deliver items the courier can pass the items to me from a range of ~400 (dunno exactly definitely higher than 0 range) but if I shift-queue ""Deliver Items"" -> ""Return to Base"" the courier still passes items to me from being ~400 range away but after that it continues to walk up to 0 range of my hero before it actually returns.

I just started Dota2,self.DotA2,Hey guys! I just started playing Dota. I came over from LoL and its pretty different but the characters in it are really cool. But I have a very big problem with it. None of the characters I actually enjoy (Medusa Naga Siren Crystal Maiden) are available to me in multiplayer. I was told coming over every hero was unlocked so the first game I played multiplayer I was floored to find out I couldn't actually play who I wanted. I don't suppose there is any way to hasten the process like perhaps beating AI for 25 games? In all honesty I am having a hard time enjoying multiplayer since I can't even drop a bit of cash to buy CM for those first 25 games. Anyways if any of you can help please do!

New player here. I already love Dota2 but I have an hard time finding polite and cooperative people to play with,self.DotA2,"Hey guys I've been playing SC2 and SCBW for many years and  after watching Day9 tutorials I decided to give dota2 a try.  After 100 hours even though I think I'm still new cause I don't know half of heroes skill I can safely say I love the game especially for the teamplay aspect that I've never experienced in Starcraft. Unfortunately my experience with the community hasn't been that great at all.   I started vs bots so I could not upset anyone when learning the basics then I switched to unranked to have a feeling of what ""real"" dota is. As I said the game feels stellar but the people I'm playing with are usually behaving terribly. I'm not a sensitive man but after a whole day spent between universitystudying and gym I would like to enjoy the game and not waste 40-50 minutes of my time because people refuse to communicate call people names get upset because I'm dying in a damn unranked match or start trolling or feeding because that's what gives them joy.   I play Dota because I like the team aspect otherwise I'd just play only SC. So guys how do you deal with this mess? Does it get better in ranked mode? Is there a place to find cooperative people to play with who realize that it is just a game and we should not get mad because of it and behave politely? ",question
Did anyone notice Arteezy gave LaNm a Bottle charge during EG vs. DK?,self.DotA2,"I was busy today so I just get to watch replays. In Match ID 772457564 EG vs. DK 29:00 replay time/14:21 game time: ppd's Bane puts a Fiend's Grip onto LaNm's Juggernaut as Arteezy's Tinker Travels in. Arteezy casts Heat Seeking Missile into Laser then gives a Bottle charge to LaNm (!) before going for a single right click before being Omnislashed; then EG are stunned and counter-ganked by MMY! and BurNIng.  Now here's some notes:  1. ~~This did not change the effect of the gank. Slowing the replay down shows that the Laser left LaNm at 88 HP with 6.46 armor; Arteezy only had 70 Auto-Attack Damage (Damage variance: up to 73) and neither ppd nor the nearby Radiant Siege Creep attacked LaNm afterwards.~~ This likely **DID** change the effect of the gank: LaNm was drained to 195 Mana from the Fiend's Grip and Omnislash level 1 requires 200 mana. Juggernaut had a Mana regeneration rate of 0.97 Mana/second but managed to cast Omnislash only 2.20 seconds after the last tick of Fiend's Grip. Had he not Omnislashed just then Arteezy would likely have been able to squeeze off that last Auto-Attack in-progress. ~/u/TheSparrowX  2. The Bottle charge activated immediately after Laser landed during what appears to be Laser's backswing. This basically gave it the maximum possible duration before Arteezy's Auto-Attack landed.  3. Neither TobiWan nor syndereN seem to take note of or comment on the Bottle usage.  4. It's possible Arteezy was holding Control for some awful reason while mashing his Bottle and gave LaNm the charge (why would this target Enemies though?) but what's more likely is:  5. For those of you who don't know there was a bug floating around a few months (a year?) ago where Tinker (or Treant Protector or any Hero with Boots of Travel to a lesser extent) could share Bottle charges globally by abusing the fact that Targets in Dota 2 seem to be tied to Units rather than to Abilities. This bug was ""fixed"" but later it was discovered that any Hero could instantly kill Razor from across the map with a Blade Mail a Ring of Basillius and a Town Portal Scroll.  (Town Portal targets Razor (who is a valid target for 'frog knows why (Units weren't even valid targets in DotA 1 only ground)); and then spam-toggling Ring of Basillius (changed from DotA 1 to no longer interrupt Channeling) would force the Ring of Basillius ability to target Razor triggering Unstable Current which is Returned via Blade Mail.)  Now from these isolated cases it seems that Valve never actually fixed that no-target Abilities used during other Abilities would inherit their target from the Hero's current target and simply disabled these certain Abilities from targeting in this way. This event today seems to indicate this further. What ought to be done about this? I don't know but it seems to me that the targeting thing is some bug with the Dota 2 engine which may not be so easy to fix without unforeseen consequences. This is just intuition however; I am not a Valve developer.  Dissere.  edit: appears to have been fixed",question

Fellow high mmr Storm players how do you proc your overload charges?,self.DotA2,Do you simply use right click or do you use attack move assigned hotkey?        Right now my combo for solo pick offs is.      1. Roll near enemy behind him while attack moving/throwing overload whilst in a roll.      2. When I past by him I press Remenant quickly followed by attack move to lose the second overload charge.        3. Then depending on the situation I use Vortex and attack move to lose the third charge or make small rolls to abuse turn rate and lose 3x overload charges and wait for the next Remnant to come off c/d.           Can you provide me some tips? I want to be as smooth as possible executing my combo. I have been playing a lot and watching replays (sumail and Miracle) but I really need specific details. I find that there is quite a delay after step  one. Should I roll again and then pop the first Remnant?       ***EDIT*** : Since people helped with upvotes here are the two things that were unnoticed by me that should be helpful to fellow Storm players to think about/brainstorm.         * Turn rate after roll causes a delay       * Vortex < Lv.3 causes delay in combo'ing        ,question

The Dota 2 workshop and its ecosystem are dying: here's why,self.DotA2,"Hello everyone. This thread was written collectively by many artists of the Dota Workshop community and were going to talk about a few serious issues that have as of late severely hurt it.  First off let us say that we all love the Workshop and deeply appreciate that Valve has created an environment where artists can contribute to games that are held in such high regard by the community. It is amazing to see how high the bar for quality has been raised since the early days of the Workshop. With no time constraints and a competitive environment we are able to take pride in our work and set our own deadlines to produce the highest quality assets possible.   Second we'd like to dispel the notion that Workshop artists are millionaires. Most of us have until now been able to make a decent living and it's been a comparable sometimes superior alternative to freelance work for those of us who have been successful at it. We will get to the real draw and appeal of the Workshop later down this thread.  Third for those unaware **heres a quick summary of how the Steam Workshop works for Dota 2**. Artists can create item sets for your favorite heroes couriers wards etc. and if after the community votes on it Valve decides they want to put your item in the game you receive a portion of the sales of your item or the chest your item is in. If your item or item set goes into a treasure chest that had 10 things total in it (e.g. 8 sets 1 ward 1 courier) you get 1/10th of the artists share (by default 25%) of the net profits of that treasure. If you got 2 things (e.g. 1 courier + 1 set) in that 10-things chest you get 2/10ths. Rarity does not factor into this. Once an item is accepted its out of the artists hands and it is *entirely* up to Valve to determine how and specifically in which way it is sold bundled implemented and whether they want to make modifications to it (e.g. particles).   So. As we've said there are big issues happening in Workshop land and we have been unable to get a response from Valve about it. Many artists are becoming disheartened feeling like we have no recourse (besides talking about it hence this thread) and as such many feel it is time to move on from the Workshop entirely and many already have. Some of us have been a part of the Workshop since the beginning seven years ago and have been part of the Valve games community through modding long before that. Promoting the growth of the Workshop as a unique opportunity for game artists is something weve invested years into and the last thing we want is to see this unique concept disappear.    **Now let's take a step back and look at this issue's origin and how it got to this point.**   * * *   # PART 1: BETWEEN TI5 AND THE BOSTON MAJOR  After TI5 in the fall of 2015 Valve announced there would be three Dota 2 Major tournaments around the world leading up to TI6. Workshop artists were excited by this prospect. It finally promised more structure to treasure chest releases something that during 2015 had become almost entirely controlled by third party tournaments. It looked like Majors would revitalize and improve not only the Dota 2 competitive scene but also the way cosmetic items would be sold!  Shortly after the announcement e-mails rolled out for the first Fall 2015 Major treasure. This was unusual at the time because Valve would usually just put your set in the game without the need to notify you. The reason they needed to notify you for this was because you were now required to agree to give them half of your 25% share of the revenue bringing our share down to 12.5% **while introducing a different way to split the revenue among artists**.   With the Majors system our work is included either as part of the Battle Pass itself (level-up gifts quest path rewards) or in its treasure chests.  How does it work? All artists who are included in the Battle Pass and its treasures earn a portion of the 12.5% of the profits that is to say the treasure sales AND the sales of the Pass itself regardless of whether their item is a quest path reward a chest item or a level-up drop; profits from the Pass and the treasures are thrown in a global pool.   EDIT HERE TO FURTHER CLARIFY: if a solo artist made a courier that got included as a level up reward if another solo artist made a set that got selected to be a quest reward in the Pass and if yet another solo artist made a set that was included in one of the treasure chests then all of these artists get paid the same amount. If there were 100 items included overall across the pass and the treasure chests each of these items awards 1/100th of the ""global revenue pool"" of the artist's share (12.5%) of the major's profits to the artist or artists who created the item. And obviously if you got more than one item in the pass/chests then you get your part of the 1/100th for each item you worked on (or all of the 1/100th if you worked solo but solo artists are very rare).  (we realize this may sound complicated but it's in fact a very cool simplified system)  **This was a really great and fair system to all the artists** since the sales of the later chests logically cant reach the sales of the earlier chests of the Majors timeframe and more importantly because the level-up rewards in the Pass include at least one of every treasure. By the time the 3rd and 4th treasures are released many of the owners of the Pass have already earned several of the chests and therefore buy fewer of them. However since all artists are part of this Pass ""pool revenue system"" regardless of when their item (and its treasure chest) is made available artists are still fairly and equitably compensated; the revenue is evened out across items.  Everyone involved ended up doing just as well as they would have on any other Valve treasure release because as expected the Battle Pass and its associated treasures sold quite well. **There were lots of positivity regarding the structure of this new standard** going forward because some much needed stability was implied.  As 2016 crept up things were still working out all right on our end. People were getting paid similarly to what they would expect Valve appeared to have delivered some semblance of structure and control that many had asked over the course of 2015. We did however start to lose some artists because of the significant gap between opportunities to break in and get paid. If you didn't get anything into one of these Majors you were going six to eight months without income.   Then they failed to produce anything for the Spring 2016 Major. It's understandably difficult to plan for something being held so close to the massive effort that is TI6 and they've remedied that particular issue for 2017. Not a problem in and of itself at the time if you already had items accepted in previous Majors but we'll get back to this later on.  With Valve forgetting to invite Workshop artists at TI6 until the last possible minute meaning that few people could make it *(note: they fixed this for TI7 invites are already out)* and the lack of any Workshop-related events at Key Arena most of us became concerned about what the future of the Workshop was going to be like.   * * *   # PART 2: THE NEW SYSTEM  Enter the Fall 2016 Major. E-mails have become the standard Workshop agreement at this point. With the Majors being the only real opportunities to get anything in-game you're basically forced to agree to these terms.  The alternative is having already worked for months on submissions that will never get in-game because these are your only opportunities. **Unless you like working for free you can only say yes to the e-mails always.** Valve holds all the power in this situation artists have zero leverage but for the most part until this point it had been working out for everyone involved.  When the sales data became available to us for the Fall 2016 Major *(note: it only becomes available once every single item thats part of the global revenue pool has been added to the game that is to say once the last chest is released)* most Workshop artists became suspicious of the much lower than expected numbers and on close inspection **it became clear that unlike before we had not been compensated in any way for the Battle Pass sales even though they were a very significant part to the total amount paid out to Workshop artists.**  At first some of us thought this was a mistake that would later be remedied. When contacted the Dota 2 team quickly made it very clear that this was intentional but declined to answer any questions or concerns. They have continued to ignore us since.  However we were absolutely and undeniably a part of the Battle Pass! Not only **people needed to buy the Pass [before they were allowed to purchase](http://i.imgur.com/lrpnoTV.png) its treasures** but [our contributions were prominently featured](http://i.imgur.com/0Qlwvtl.jpg) inside of it.  And of course dont forget that the treasures where the bulk of the artists work is present **[were given out as rewards](http://i.imgur.com/GzhTMzk.png)** when players level up their Battle Pass. By level 60 owners of the Battle Pass had no less than **17 treasure drops** in addition to 5 community-made courier/ward drops.   We feel that the Battle Pass relies heavily on our work and that it makes little sense for artists that have contributed all its cosmetic items to not see a cent of it anymore.  And with the Pass not contributing to the revenue pool being paid to contributors **this effectively means that the artists who created any items that were only available in the Pass (anything not in chests) have been paid by further diluting other artists revenue**.   While its hard to estimate the exact amount of money that we are losing out on we can tell you that the Battle Pass sales contributed to roughly half of the revenue pool paid out to artists. It removed more than half of the available income from the Major and gave it to Valve on top of the half Valve already claims for the sake of funding the Major. Without exaggeration we went from a 25% revenue share to roughly 6% over the course of a single year.  The same issues continued through the Winter 2017 Battle Pass with even worse results. Not only does this Pass only have three treasure chests instead of four but the sales for these three chests are *significantly lower* than last year. **For example even if you got 3 times as many items in the Winter 2017 major compared to Winter 2016 you'd only be getting half the money. This means things are effectively 6 times worse as before** and to say this hurts the viability of the Workshop for artists would be a massive understatement.  This is information that we wish to put out there not only for the members of this community but also other artists who have not been in the know about what has been happening or who have considered joining the Workshop because they heard lots of great things about it.   * * *   # PART 3: THE VIABILITY OF THE WORKSHOP  With only 2 majors serving as opportunities to get something in the game and a single Collector's Cache in TI all spaced some 4 months apart you're going 4 months between opportunities for income and missing even one event is something most full-time artists can not survive. **When the resulting pay is then no longer substantial enough once you finally do get something in who will be left to produce the kind of quality and quantity of content required to fill treasures and fund Majors?**  In the midst of all this the Call to Arms for TI7 has just been announced and it is aquatic- themed. There is nothing wrong with a themed Call to Arms event but when it's for the TI7 Collector's Cache and we know that's the only chest that's going to be released within the next 5 months what do we do with the sets we've been working on and have released since the beginning of the year with hopes of making the Collector's Cache? It's hard to get excited for something that nullifies the chances of getting anything you've worked on so far into the only available chest until the unannounced Fall 2017 Major an event that may or may not happen that you will not get paid for until January 2018 almost a year from now.  On top of that it's hard to imagine that Valve will not find a way to claim a bigger share of the Collector's Cache than expected because that's exactly what happened with the New Bloom / Lunar New Year 2017 event. Everyone was led to believe the Lunar New Year chest(s) would be sold separately and compensated for without the 12.5% Major funding cut going to Valve. Instead it was pushed into the Winter 2017 Battle Pass with the results we mentioned above.  We have heard people claim the Workshop was never intended to be a full-time job. Not only has Valve touted it as a full-time job through articles in the past and the revenue they've distributed to artists but that revenue is the biggest thing that has kept the Workshop competitive and productive enough to be successful as a funding engine for Dota 2 for all these years. It has attracted and continued to enjoy AAA talent for that reason talent that is now forced to exit the Workshop because it is no longer viable compared to other work. It has always been a huge risk but the Workshop only functions when the rare payouts you only have a small chance to get are worth the extensive work you have to produce to get those opportunities.  We've tried continuously to reach out to the Dota 2 team Gabe Newell and Erik Johnson about these concerns over the past six months but we have received no response.  It has been particularly hard to read quotes like this being released in the midst of trying and failing to get answers for why the Dota 2 team is digging further and further into our revenue:   **_""The scarce commodity here is not money -- it's how many hours there are in a day""_**  In this quote from an interview with Gamasutra Gabe Newell is being honest; we have no doubt of that. In fact our only hope lately has been that maybe he would see what's going on and take some action to preserve the Workshop as he has always seemed like an enthusiastic proponent of UGC as a business model.  The CS:GO Workshop is still being run (and monetized) successfully without any cuts to artist revenue and in fact those artists have typically always earned more than Dotas.   Artists have increasingly been giving up on the Dota Workshop over the past six months. Everyone has been reluctant to speak publicly about what's going on. A fear of the consequences of speaking out has been a very real thing. The Dota 2 team has over the past year become increasingly faceless unresponsive and impossible to communicate with.  **Why do some of us care so much?**  Because we truly believe that the Workshop is the most incredible engine for funding a free-to-play game that has ever been conceived and some of us have been a cheerleader for the model to everyone we've met since we started contributing to the game. It's a completely community driven effort on both the side of the creators and the consumers. It is at its best a successful signature product of Valve experimentation and implementation something that should be nourished and grown cared for and held up as a legitimately amazing form of a successful UGC driven economy.  It has empowered 3D and 2D designers both amateur and professional to take full charge of their own designs and compete in an environment filled with other top-grade artists from around the world. It has given artists who might have problems fitting into a standard rigid work schedule for reasons physical medical or mental a platform on which they can not only support themselves but thrive.  We've always assumed the success of Workshop artists the community and Dota 2 as both a game and an esport would all go hand-in-hand. It has become depressingly clear over the past eight months that Valve or elements within Valve think this is not the case.  If the Workshop was to fail as a full-time job prospect we would expect and want that to be a result of a market dive the failure of cosmetics we create to drive the economy of Dota 2 and not seemingly artificially imposed cuts to our share of the revenue to line other pockets or avenues for undisclosed reasons.  **After all the above for many of us the Call to Arms for the TI7 Collector's Cache represents a final breaking point of the Dota 2 Workshop.** Those of us who manage to get something in it may be able to continue doing this through the year into a further uncertain future. Those of us who don't are going to have to call it quits.  We dont have any sort of leverage and we have essentially been ignored by Valve. And some of us fear that if we were to continue to press the issue with them we might get essentially blacklisted from the Steam Workshop so we have been left with little choice but to bring this matter to your attention directly in a collective manner.  We hope that with attention brought to this issue we can see some systemic change and even maybe a better future for Dota cosmetics as a whole. Thank you for reading!  ",workshop

Rick and Morty Announcer Pack hype,self.DotA2,did anyone see it on the E3 stream,workshop
After almost a year of work we are finally ready to launch our CARRY OMNIKNIGHT set with something no one else has done before a full Alt Voice Pack! Come take a look!,self.DotA2,One year ago at Ti4 I went around to all of the workshop artists carrying this [very high quality hand drawn omni set](http://imgur.com/PEk041V). Many laughed but one decided that they would give it a go. After [several attempts and discussions](http://imgur.com/UXz1FuS) it is finally ready.   **HERE IS THE SET!**  [IMMORTALIS!](http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=505305858)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Inspired by a fusion of Greek and Roman military units the set was beautifully crafted by Chemical Alia and Drysocket and features 2 different head styles one with a sweet helm and another with the signature badass bandanna. I know that a lot of people want only the flashiest and cumbersome sets in now-a-days but I wanted something that would look like it would fit but have a really cool design in the world of Dota 2. Hopefully you agree that we succeeded!   Also you get nips! Sweet sweet nips. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- But thats not all folks.   For the last several weeks I have been sneaking off to do a alternate voice pack to co release with the set. I have a sample here for you to enjoy.  [Take a listen!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRV3iz5hCNY)  Im a big lore nerd so I tried to explain why omni's voice went all crazy when the set is on so feel free to check out my lore on the Immortalis workshop page and lemme know what you think.   We have made several alternate versions of each voice line and have added in several custom trigger events as well. this includes   -around 400-450 total lines   -around 14 hours of studio recording   -all original lines redone in the Immortalis voice   -alternates to all lines custom made for Immortalis   -healing lines for most heros (activates when healing heros that work well with omni) and eventually all heros   -kill lines for most heros and eventually all heros (up to 3 per hero)   -custom trigger lines (such as healing a friend with very low health killing a enemy who just killed allies repeling a enemy and hundreds more)   -custom item lines with a emphisis on items that are typically built on omniknight   -so much more. so very much more.   If my dream could come true I would have it be unlocked for anyone who wore the full set and it would be toggleable on and off. Also it would be client side only (like announcers).   Anyhow the voice pack is a new idea no one has tried before but if it gets good reception we will expedite our release.   **also if you have any good lines feel free to post them I have 1 more recording session in me! if we use it we will credit you. WHOO**  well thanks for looking and hopefully voting this dream set has been a long time coming! Please let us know what you think!   ,workshop

Snow Brawl (dota 2 custom game) getting attacked by phantom downvotes. Valve please help,self.DotA2,Our development team has spent the last two months hard at work building and testing our game Snow Brawl for the Frostivus entry.  Whether we win or lose we really just want people to enjoy and play our game.  We released our game on Monday and currently have 368 subscribers prior to today had an approval rating of 80% and a 4 out of 5 stars which is a huge success in our minds.   However sometime between last night and today our game has received over 500 additional negative votes against us.  Which seems impossible since we've only had 400 unique subscribers in total.    We have already submitted a ticket to Valve's Support but have yet to get a response. However  I know Valve frequently reads /r/dota2  So we are hoping this post can get upvoted enough to get Valve's attention.   Even if you didn't like our game or even custom games in general it shouldn't matter.   All we're asking is to simply up vote this post so we can be heard and are game to be judged fairly and not buried behind these phantom votes.  https://imgur.com/a/plhhp (stats of our game 9:40pm est 11/16) https://imgur.com/a/EceaD (graph of the ratings)  Workshop page: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1200619594  -- update:  Thanks Reddit for your help and support. The last 24 hours has really restored our faith in this community and can't say enough how much we appreciate your backing of us on this.   If I knew we'd get this much attention I would have sabotaged the game myself. (just joking those tin foil hat's look great on you guys).  At this time we still haven't heard from Valve but we have been made aware the Frostivus competition has been extended to the 11/24 hopefully this will give Valve more time to sort this out.,workshop

Creating cosmetics for pro players is an awful idea for artists,self.DotA2,Hey Workshop artists u/ChemicalAlia and u/Drysocket here.  This morning we were contacted by the manager of a well-known pro player about having a custom set made for him.  This reminded us about just how terrible of an idea it is for artists to work with players/teams/other organizations in the current Workshop environment and we thought that we should make a thread to talk about that in more detail maybe bounce some ideas off of Dota Reddit to see what you all thought towards a solution.  Disclaimer:  There are some awesome pros and personalities who are a pleasure to work with; and making a decision to work with anybody is yours and yours alone.  Were only speaking from a logical standpoint.  &nbsp;  **Here are the main two issues which well elaborate on below:** 1: Player sets are bundled in chests so you cant support the player directly. 2: The benefits that you gain from working with pros are basically nonexistent and not worth the revenue cut you give them. Honestly speaking its charity work.  &nbsp;  **To artists:** If youve made something for a pro player/team/3rd party Dota person and it gets accepted congratulations!  Youve probably just given a sizeable chunk of your revenue away and got nothing in return for it.  If thats your rent or mortgage for the next few months or year oh boy we feel that feels.   Artists at one point were but are no longer credited anywhere in the store for their work.  There is no way for the customer to know that a given set is FOR said pro player/team.  It's just some random set in some chest.  In the past that was one of the main justifications for giving a large chunk of money to that organization: the expectation that their name will be able to pull in more sales on the store from supporters in return for that revenue split.  &nbsp;  **What orgs may promise you in exchange for their revenue cut and why it isnt worth it to the artist:**     * An expedited path to getting a set accepted with standards lowered because of their magic Valve connections.  While two or so years ago that definitely did work (to an abusively successful level) that is fortunately no longer the case. There are no shortcuts now (Please send all known shortcuts to: ValveAddPlz@gmail.com).     * Exposure to help build your reputation as a workshop artist. Ask yourself however when was the last time you saw a workshop artist become successful/popular BECAUSE of their collaborations with 3rd parties?  From what weve seen the credit usually goes straight to the player/team itself unless the artist is already very established.  &nbsp;  Weve seen player sets on the workshop with literally 4 5 6+ ARTISTS on them.  To these artists wed advise you to really consider how much youre actually getting out of the deal and if it is really worth whatever percent youre giving away to what essentially amounts to charity.  &nbsp;  Also don't look to popular artists making player sets as a sign that it's a great idea. Some of them have already made enough money to retire many times over and since money is not an issue they are free to be do whatever the hell they want.  &nbsp;  In reality you will be relying solely on Workshop exposure the entire premise of which has been slowly deteriorating over the past year and a half due to its own usability issues.  We may as well admit that THIS is the Workshop now:  &nbsp;  http://i.imgur.com/512bC44.jpg  &nbsp;  Even still it can take many months and sometimes years for sets to get in so by the time something actually gets added itll probably be long forgotten unless its one of the most memorable sets on the Workshop ever.  Hopefully Valve is aware of this as popularity on the Workshop rarely seems to be a factor in their selection process for accepting sets.  &nbsp;  The bottom line is working with a pro/team/org will probably not be worth it to you.  In this current environment you need to seriously ask yourself if the kind of revenue splits that are commonly expected is worth giving away for all of the work that you do.  A lot of these team/player managers who negotiate the deals are businesspeople and many of the Workshop artists are naive kids/new to the game industry and have no business experience.  One could argue rightfully that its even a bit predatory.  Protect yourself your art and know that youre doing them a favor not the other way around.  &nbsp;  **How to improve things?**  We have some ideas but want to know what suggestions the community and other artists may have about this problem.    &nbsp;   For example it would be worth seeing what would happen if Valve started releasing player sets to the store instead of including them in chests which defeats the entire purpose.  Perhaps they could expand on the Pro Store to include player sets and make a stronger push towards marketing them.  It seemed like that was originally the direction Valve was going but stopped somewhere along the line.  &nbsp;  Regarding artists shouldering all of the financial burden and risk: What if the revenue situation was like how Valve now handles tournaments in which a certain percent of the players take comes from the artist and that same amount is matched by Valve?  This could even be standardized to prevent gouging from either side.  &nbsp;  Alternately what if contributions to the players/teams was handled more like the Service Provider system?  &nbsp;  **Final thoughts:**  What do you guys even think about the idea of player sets in general?  Is it stupid?  Awesome?  Did you always support them?  Do you now?  If player sets are not even a thing anymore then thats all the more reason for artists to take note.  &nbsp;  It sucks seeing artists screwed over because the system has changed in such a way that it only hurts them.  Some things that were a great idea several years ago no longer are and because the Workshop is constantly evolving you have to constantly re-evaluate your plan if you want to stay afloat.  Weve been doing this since the inception of the Workshop and have all too often learned that the hard way so we just want to pass on a little of what weve learned.   &nbsp;  Weve always believed that the Workshop could be an amazing alternate opportunity for game artists outside of studio work.  Although there are some big issues right now that are preventing it from being as awesome as it should be we want to see it prosper.  &nbsp;  P.S. This is only tangentially related but important to note:  If you are an artist who works with any 3rd party organization we STRONGLY advise that you specify early in your correspondence that you own the artwork not them.  This is **very important** from a legal standpoint. There are many ways that things can go badly and you need to be able to pull out if necessary and keep the work you have made.  Things often go south one way or another and OWNERSHIP is something that the artist needs to make apparent a.s.a.p. ,workshop

Official System Shock 2 SHODAN Announcer pack in the works. We need your help!,self.DotA2,Greetings /r/DotA2  My name is [Stephen Kick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smkick) and I'm the CEO of [Night Dive Studios](http://www.nightdivestudios.com/) we are responsible for bringing back many classic PC games to Steam our most notable title being [System Shock 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/238210/). We're all big DotA fans and after attending TI4 this year we began thinking about ways we could blend our love of classic games and DotA.  One of our better ideas was creating a **SHODAN** announcer pack. If you aren't familiar SHODAN is the rogue artificial intelligence that taunts and misdirects you as you roam her halls on board the doomed spaceship Von Braun. [She has a very iconic voice and her dialog is bone chilling.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGEjKoGHzO0)    We've been in contact with Terri (the voice of SHODAN) and Eric Brosius (Sound engineer from SS2) and they are both on board with the project.  We also proposed the idea to Valve but before diving right into production they asked us to approach **you** the DotA2 community to get your opinion. Would you be interested in a SHODAN announcer pack? Would it be too similar to Valve's own GLaDOS announcer? Do you have any suggestions on how we can best represent both System Shock 2 and DotA2? Do you have any ideas or maybe specific lines you'd like to hear?   Please give us your honest opinion! We want to create the best announcer pack we can and we can't do it without you. If you haven't played System Shock 2 and would like to give it a go send me a PM. I'll be giving away keys to the first 25 messages I receive.  **edit: The keys are gone! Thanks to everyone who responded!**  **edit#2: Thanks for the gold!**  **edit#3: 12/10/14 We have started production!**  **edit#4: 3/12/15 Looking for ideas for SS2 wards and couriers!

Workshop Drama,self.DotA2,"For those of you who don't know me: I'm the creator of the PubSimulator bots.   After seeing the top Reddit post here about the Shutnik bots (called Rage Trigger) I got curious and checked his code out. When I was reading his code it reminded me of AdamQQQ's ""Ranked Matchmaking AI"" (if you haven't subscribed to AdamQQQ do it I think his bots are the best ones in the workshop hands down). At first I thought this is just the shrine usages (as he has said it in his post) but after looking at other files I realized that he has basically copy pasted the code of almost **58 out of 115** heroes from AdamQQQ as well as all of AdamQQQ changes in the bot behaviors (he has removed the AdamQQQ's name from all of the files of course which is literally the only difference).   Until now you might say ""alright probably he forgot to mention this"" which is still not fine but could be an honest mistake. After seeing this I got curious about the other heroes that ""he"" has implemented. After some investigations I realized that the **heroes that haven't been copy-pasted from AdamQQQ's code are a copy paste from ""BOT EXPERIMENT Credit:FURIOUSPUPPY""** (BTW. most people don't know this but Furious Puppy is not the main author of those bots the guy who wrote BOT EXPERIMENT used some of Furious Puppy's code and this is his weird way of referencing him). I should also mention Shutnik has made some changes (from what I see it is only what items should bots buy and their leveling up order which is a quite trivial task if you are familiar with bot scripting) but in no way he is the main author of the bots (and I also didn't go through other codes in the workshop maybe these are also someone else's code. At this point I wouldn't be surprised if this is the case).   How can you check these claims:   - When you subscribe to ""BOT EXPERIMENT Credit:FURIOUSPUPPY"" you can find his code in ""...\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\570\837040016"". - When you subscribe to ""Ranked Matchmaking AI"" you can find his code in ""...\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\570\855965029"". - You can find Shutnik's code in his post (which is still on the front page as I'm writing this). - Open any of the ""ability-item-usage-*.lua"" files from the Shutnik bots you can see it has been copy-pasted from one of the above. Other files are mostly copied from AdamQQQ.   Final words: there is not a problem with using someone else's code as some of the other bots in the workshop are doing this but not referencing someone else's work properly is not fine especially when you have copy pasted more code from them than that you have written yourself. I am friend with some of the bot scripters and they sometimes compain to me about the fact that someone can just copy their work (which has happened many times before but to no success) and the workshop doesn't have a system to catch plagiarism. Another reason why I made this post is that AdamQQQ is Chinese and ""! "" (creator of bot experiment) is Russian so they may not know about the Shutnik's Reddit post and his bots.  Edit: if I get a response from any of the involved parties I'll include it here.  - Shutnik's response:  ""Dramma? Cool. Ok lets see: Arizona is not a russian he just learn this language and choose a russian nickname. Jokes on you. I used a lot of his code and mentioned that in a post am i? And btw he was listed before in a workshop page but decided to un-mod himself from my project. Sadly reasons unknown. Script is changed a lot since then bots have learned how to lane properly how to push how to everything basically. Arizona's bots have default behavior. This is even in a description. New bots such as Lycan Balanar etc etc think exactly like a default. Except warding and rune logic which is global. They can use spells and learn tallents and thats great and this is the reason why they used. Compare it to my script now and say they are the same in their behavior. About adamQQQ: i did take some of his scripts (and did mention it) cuz there is no need to re-invent a wheel if his bots doing damn good about shrines or whatever i'll take it. Some of his bots have a behavior rules applied to one bot. I did the job to make all this special moments work together for every bot. His and Furious Puppy and Arizona's. Plagiarizm Please be fair. If you dig enough to find out this code something alike of Arizona's dig also in my VK. In my group i was releasing updates continiously. Check the dates when i released updates. My work was used in other bots scripts and i have nothing against it. Go on and take it i dont mind it is open sourced. Because we do it for free for a community. And there is no reason to bark at each other trying to hide your stuff one from another. If authors somehow disagree with it and want to made a holy war based on nothing for nothing well ill take it. Get rid of the ""alien"" code eventually. On the other side i can ask for the same. But i will not.""  - My thoughts:  No he did not just use ""some"" of AdamQQQ's code he has copied almost all of his code (again you can check it for yourself). Also read this carefully: ""I did the job to make all this special moments work together for every bot. His and Furious Puppy and Arizona's."" which basically mean I got their code and put them together which again you can judge for yourself whether his post was in any way implying.  - AdamQQQ's Response:  Hi every one I'm the author of ""Ranked Matchmaking AI"". ""I just knew about it it was a bit too bad. I checked Shutnik bots codes by notepad++ compare plugin. Surprisingly in addition to the licenses and comments the other is exactly the same. Remove these comments can be said to be a big project. All of us know what is open source which great to promote the development of computer science. Every could use others code with a reference or other licenses (such as GPL). In my script description I aslo written this words. (You are free to use all of the codes for any non-commercial purposes you choose with a reference to the original Author. Do not use any of the files here for any program which is not open source and free to use.) Sorry I don't know much about GPL. But in this time Shutnik not only copied my own code but also copied a lot of other people (include Improved Default Bots by v33 and so on) without a reference. Although he mentioned my name but is only a great shrine solution and S.B. scripts? Some times I want to implement some new heroes but in workshop I couldn't found something new in hero ability usage. They all look like BOT EXPERIMENT's copy. In the end I already read all of posts there.Although I did not understand it all with my poor English. Because I don't understand slang and abbreviation. I only understand the formal English. Thanks to PLATINUM_DOTA and everyone who care the bot script.""  ",workshop

On this Frostivus Night I would be eternally grateful if you could give our Frostivus Entry a shot before it's forgotten forever. It's a high difficulty horde mode in the style of Left 4 Dead with changing objectives as you go through 4 different Acts.,self.DotA2,[The Second Day of Frostivus](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1197063942)  *Every year the first night of Frostivus passed peacefully. On the second day Frostivus was canceled. But not this year. As Roshan is delivering the presents he is attacked and his sleigh is shot out of the air. The heroes from the Dire and Radiant decide to form a truce to work together to help Roshan and make sure that this year Frostivus will finally happen. And so the unlikely alliance sets out to defeat the horde of Greevils and help Roshan fix his sleigh find the lost presents and deliver them to all the good boy and girls. Maybe you'll even find out who is behind these attacks and stop them for good.*  The Second Day of Frostivus is a 5 player cooperative horde mode in which you are tasked with completing various objectives while fighting back a horde of Greevils and various special and boss units. The game takes about 30 minutes to complete but because of the high difficulty don't expect to be able to do it on the first try. [Bulldog couldn't.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyEy0t1Z16I)  We worked very hard on this game. A team of 12 people all put their heart and soul into this to deliver an experience with custom music custom artwork a custom tileset for the map custom items and carefully handcrafted balance to make the game be challenging but still fair.  I would be overjoyed if you could give the game a shot while it's still topical and playable. It's highly likely future patches will destroy it and we aren't likely to be able to maintain it to keep it playable. If you enjoyed Dark Moon Siltbreaker or Wraith Night then this should be right down your alley. So grab 4 friends and see if you can make it all the way to the end and beat the mysterious final boss.  I really hope you enjoy the game. I am very proud of it. And I am very proud of my team for being able to complete it in time.  Have a good day.,workshop

One last plea from the Custom Game Community. Give us another week and we'll give you better games.,self.DotA2,This topic has been thoroughly discussed so I'll keep it short.  Valve please extend the deadline for the Frostivus Custom Game contest by one week. Just one week would allow us to do so much more and let us polish our games a bit. And it really can't delay the Frostivus release by much.  I am not the only member of the custom game community asking for this. So this is where I request that the other members of the community leave a comment in this thread. Let us come together and show Valve that we ask this as a community.  For anyone lacking [context](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7b1mo1/707_and_the_frostivus_custom_game_contest/).  Edit: So I am just going to put this here I guess. I want to make clear that I am not trying to get some sort of competitive advantage here. I genuinely thought that the majority of developers were on board with this because last time I posted about this people largely agreed as well as conversations I had in private. The voices on here are more split. If I am alone in wanting this extension then we should not have it. I was just trying to help. (I also want to clarify that our game will be done within the deadline I just want another week for polish),workshop

Dragon's Ascension: Set for Dragon Knight,self.DotA2,Hi Reddit!  I nervously present you with the spiritual successor to the Father of Dragons set I made last year.  The amount of love that set has gotten has meant a lot to me and I would like to thank everyone who has suggested I re-design the set and submit it on my own.  Now that I'm no longer bound by the narrow restrictions a fully evolving set presents I think this version is better executed and better designed than the previous set.  I'm planning on some more heavy duty work on the loading screen and a dragon form to accompany the set is coming soon!

Frog Witch Doctor? Artist here please read!,self.DotA2,"I thought I would come out and clear things up I'm a transparent person so I'll just tell it as it is I might mention things that should probably be private.   I see a thread about it pop up every now and then and I am extremely pleased you guys like it there's alot of misinformation going around about it - a big game of telephone I suppose.  &nbsp;   **Going down the timeline here -**  - The ingame ward only has 1 animation (It's a tree) the importer has 3 (spawn attack die) when you import it only plays the attack - this was Initially the problem with the set (Easy solution would be to blend our animations into a single one thats how I made a preview video showing the ward in game working... Communication?) This is why it was delayed at first. I think this was fixed? We got as we got asked for something else. - We got notified that we need to create a low violence (LV) loadscreen for China (We also got asked to make low violence ward fx even though we didn't use ward FX the default skull is Valves and their LV is a air ball which looks a bit lame to be fair) - At this point I spoke to my concept artist FX was hot and our Frog was the most succesful rated item ever as you can see here it peaked at 23k still 99% likes before workshop overhaul https://twitter.com/Mig_Dota/status/499242009203191808  &nbsp;  We decided we could make cool FX for the ward and possibly casket that would work for both China and rest of the world Here is a preview the idea is that he summons his  stronger magical spiritual self (Heavily inspired from Diablo3 Acid blob won't even deny it)  &nbsp;  **Loadscreen** http://i.imgur.com/q02sucO.jpg  **In-game tests** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfgIraYDCIU&feature=youtu.be  **Custom Icons** http://i.imgur.com/3EnKfXa.jpg  **Screenshot** http://i.imgur.com/exNzy9Y.jpg  (Those were WIP's can't seem to find a vid preview of final)  &nbsp;  The response on the FX was that it can only be considered once the **source 2.0** rolls out (same thing with Mushi QoP expected it) we were ok with it we try to make cool things and have fun people already wanted the frog imagine if they get extra FX as a nice surprised.  &nbsp;  So now we just waited but something happened somewhere along the line it was decided that the set is ""poorly executed"" and the wood / frog eyes are repetitive and it needs a new pass I was extremely confused at first.  &nbsp;  http://i.imgur.com/wbZcMyZ.jpg  **I made this image** to show fellow artists and get opinions UV maps and up close. Majority said they think its weird feedback biggest comment was more **depth** on the actual planks which is very valid - even moreso from the ingame view the initial feedback we got was very vague and attempt at getting more detail was ignored.  &nbsp;  Oddly enough - at this point a organization contacted me about adding it to their tournament when I expressed the feedback Valve gave me the tournament said they could probably push it in (Organizations?).  I just didn't agree  with the % split and apologize that players don't have a frog to kill people with.  &nbsp;  After a long night of sleep and a clear head me and my partner spoke again and came to the conclusion of the feedback from valve and artists we spoke to lets add more cloth (Break up between wood) few new elements (Reduce frog eye copout) more breakup on wood with patterns / shapes and chunkier wood (Thick big points of focus) instead of thin and smooth so we can really push in detail even from the in-game cam (Possibly neglected this too much and focused on tight zoomed in pixels)  &nbsp;  **Here is the current designs** we will be going with the frog was always the core of the set and we made the mistake of letting it **overshadow the set itself** but after seeing these designs we feel we will create a much better product and look forward to showing it off.  http://i.imgur.com/QY9rAR9.jpg  &nbsp;  Truth is I'm quite busy when we will fully update is unclear but its my favorite project I've ever done and my baby essentially. Whenever valve has given feedback on something - it has immensely improved it I felt the WD feedback was a bit harsh as I can't ignore some items that make it into the game but we will be delivering you a better product and thats whats important.  &nbsp;   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  &nbsp;  Bit off topic but would like peoples opinions on these 2 sets.   This whole scenario has been a huge confidence hit and has put me on tilt everytime I make a item I question the vague feedback that was given ""Repetitive elements? This BB set is full of spikes and rock shells is that repetitive and bad?""   &nbsp;   **Ember spirit**  &nbsp;   **Load** http://i.imgur.com/b0fezeO.jpg  **In-game (no weapons)** http://gfycat.com/PrestigiousIncredibleGalah  &nbsp;  This has been done for a while and is just sitting on my harddrive no idea what to do with it we don't want to upload without the ribbon FX as it just looks too  damn good source2 is coming and valve specifically asked for no FX till then (in CNY blog).  &nbsp;  **Bristleback**  &nbsp;  **Load** http://i.imgur.com/EpjaL59.jpg  **In-game** https://gfycat.com/ApprehensiveDemandingAlligatorsnappingturtle  **Having some SFM fun(old models)** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeoufQlg8s8  I love this set he looks like a beast but you can't ignore the fact that its literally made of 3 elements if the WD feedback I got should be considered on other things it's a failure.  &nbsp;  Regards  Mig_Dota ",workshop

The nightmare of designing fan hoodies.,self.DotA2,Hi Reddit!  Some of you may know me. I'm a big fan of LoL but for the last few years I've been a bigger fan of DoTA 2.  A few years ago back when I was playing both games roughly equal amounts I saw an amazing artist design a number of hoodies for a game called Mass Effect. [Take a look at them here](http://lupodirosso.deviantart.com/art/mass-effect-hoodies-Tali-and-Garrus-294739828)  I was inspired. I took it upon myself to design a set of hoodies for LoL and DotA 2 shortly after.  [View the DotA2 hoodies here.](http://sitaduncan.weebly.com/dota-2-hoodies.html)  Not long after designing the LoL hoodies I was contacted by Riot themselves. They loved my hoodies and even wanted to put them into production! I sold a few of the designs and sure enough only a few months later...  [Blitzcrank Hoodie](http://www.jinx.com/p/league_of_legends_blitzcrank_champion_zip_up_hoodie.html)  [Malzahar Hoodie](http://www.jinx.com/p/league_of_legends_malzahar_zip_up_hoodie.html)  To say it was exciting is an understatement. I submitted other designs to Riot hoping they would pick them up. Nothing ever came of it but it was cool to see people so excited over something I had designed.  I also submitted my DoTA 2 designs to Valve hoping they might like my hoodies and perhaps even produce them. Nothing ever came of contacting them either which was a disappointment but I moved on.  I was the only one who appeared to move on from my hoodies however. My inbox became a daily slog of going through requests for my hoodies everything from begging for free hoodies to offering egregious sums for some of the hoodies that I had never actually produced. I'm not exactly a seamstress so I couldn't actually make them myself so I had to turn people down a lot. All of the time to be exact.  Pretty soon however I started to be contacted by companies. Never big name companies usually sketchy sounding companies located in regions with very little copyright law who wanted to manufacture my hoodies. As I had access to the designs but not the rights to either set I had to tell them no.  I was often very unprofessionally told that they didn't appreciate my refusal to offer them the full designs. I wish I could say that was the limit of the abuse.  I began receiving messages on my facebook artist page email seemingly everywhere about how horrible of a person I was for not making these hoodies available. I feel worse for these people's lack of understanding of reality than for the abusive words they sent to me.  I wish I could say it got better.  What I had to deal next with was something far more troublesome. People began to illegally produce my designs. I refuse to provide these links but if you do a little googling you can find several hoodies produced with my unreleased designs. I submitted these to Valve's legal department and also went through the effort of submitting removal requests myself.  You can also find other artists claiming to be the artists behind my hoodies.   But there's good news everyone! (The slime pipes are working again?)  I am finally getting a chance to produce the hoodies for which I have been so doggedly harassed and begged for.  You can finally vote for them on my steam page here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=247667849&searchtext=  As you can see however it didn't take long for someone to submit a DMCA request on me. Thus continues the cycle. Thanks for listening to my story and please vote! If only so that you can make my life a little bit easier by letting people get my hoodies legally.   TLDR:  My hoodies may actually have a chance to be legitimately and legally created.  Please support the real hoodie and report any thefts that you find.  Edit: If you like Sproinking check out my Enchantress T-shirt too! http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=247655709  Update 4/13: I am totally floored by the amount of support that I have received from friends and strangers alike these past 24 hours while dealing with the art theft.  You guys make me feel truly awesome! Thank you all so much.  Jugger hoodie is now incredibly highly rated in the contest and I'm daring to believe it will be produced! As a side note you maaay be seeing some more hoodie designs and even a few prototypes from me in the near future.  Update 4/15: The DMCA has been removed from my entry and the prime art thief's entry has been banned!  7/5: No such luck with the hoodies but thank you all for your support and enjoy the International! ,workshop

Just submitted our Gyrocopter set for Chinese New Year with custom ability particles! What do you think?,self.DotA2,We've just submitted our Gyrocopter set that we've been working on for a couple of weeks called Gyrotechnics. To set our set apart from the others being submitted we've done custom particles for all 4 of Gyro's abilities and a particle for his death animation. All of the effects are based around Fireworks a staple in Chinese New Year celebrations.   I don't believe Valve has ever added custom particles submitted by community contributors before but we felt it really enhanced the set so we're hoping they're open to adding them in if the set does well.

Some of you may know [Dota IMBA](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=440115357) one of the custom games you can play in the new Reborn client.  Not too long ago IMBA was simply [a bunch of edits](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2rx4fq/presenting_dota_2_imba_a_custom_game_mod_where/) to the game's files making abilities bigger faster cheaper etc... And today it's a full-fledged custom game with 27 modified heroes 35 customized items and a bunch of options you can set up to customize your game. But more importantly: played by *so many people*!  I am truly aghast day after day by the amount of support this community delivers. The growth in playerbase has been immense - in fact player count has been rising so fast that I wanted to make this post when we hit 1 million subscribers but wasn't fast enough with the updates to do so.  Thank you. Thank you for being so supportive for enjoying something that I poured a little part of my soul into and for helping make it grow bigger and better. There's still a **lot** of stuff ahead of us before I can call IMBA a finished product but you guys are the ones keeping me consistently motivated to do it.  Thank you players thank you people who frequent the /r/dotaimba subreddit and prevent my stupid design decisions from ruining the game thank you youtubers thank you reviewers thank you Valve (especially /u/DanielJ_Valve) thank you experienced people from #dota2mods and [ModDota](http://moddota.com/forums/) who are always ready to help thank you /u/Hewdraw for the help thank you Mimiya for the inspiration and hours of fun. Thank you all!

Valve we need word on what happens now that the custom game contest deadline has passed. Are we allowed to continue updating the game? And where do we show the % shares?,self.DotA2,"Contest is over.   It is still possible to update the games. Some creators already have others are afraid to because they worry it might disqualify them. Because of the short deadline many games had to be rushed out and are experiencing some bugs. Are we allowed to fix those or not?  It's important that we know. This contest shouldn't be decided by a game of chicken. If the games are going to be judged in the state they were in when the deadline passed and updating disqualifies you then there are already quite a few modes that have disqualified themselves without knowing. If that's not how it works and you are allowed to continue working then it's not fair towards the people that aren't updating out of fear of disqualification even though the games might benefit from it. This is especially bad because some people are already updating and others want to but don't want to risk it.  A simple yes or no would suffice. We aren't asking for a lot of information here.   On that note: In the rules you state: ""2.	Identify all contributors to the submission and receive their confirmation including percentage shares for the prize.""  This functionality doesn't exist. Nobody knows where to add in the percentage shares for the members of their team. The functionality for that simply doesn't exist. We posted it in the workshop page but is that the right place? No idea. Not every team has an even split and it's important that we can communicate that. Especially since you specifically ask for it on the page.",workshop

Announcing the Open Angel Arena Anniversary Tournament a custom game tournament with a $10000+ Prize Pool!,self.DotA2,## The Open Angel Arena team is proud to announce the Open Angel Arena Anniversary Tournament a custom game tournament with a $10000+ Prize Pool.  Yes you read that right. Last weekend we had a fundraiser for our tournament and we were hoping to raise $500. **We ended up with $10349! 100% of that money is going towards the tournaments prize pool.**  * The tournament will take place on the 3rd and 4th of March starting at 3pm Berlin Time both days. * We currently plan on hosting the tournament for 32 teams. Should enough teams sign up then we might expand the tournament to a 64 team bracket.  * [Link to the rules!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YJj_oRRLvmC6zvKQxBmg4yDZVesrJOqjJokESea2tIM/edit?usp=sharing) * [Link to the sign up!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOVXbT1gyXzOEQDL2sEFQ1mD_sz08Y9NmRnMVziN7FTNBjZQ/viewform) Sign ups close Feb. 10th. * The prize pool will be split as follows: First place: 50%; Second place: 25%; Third places: 12.5%  Join the [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/9ApbMyW) to find a team for the tournament and to play games with the best players!  #### Where do I watch?  The tournament will be streamed on my [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/l34Um1) but we'll make another announcement the day of the tournament.  We are also happy to have other streamers cast tournament matches or have players stream their games. Feel free to contact us if we can be of assistance.  ## What is Open Angel Arena?  * [Trailer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jaGleeqKvw) * [How to play!](https://youtu.be/BXsSy65mSnk) (5 minutes) * [How to play and design discussion!](https://youtu.be/hI7seVtUeZo) (52 minutes) * [Workshop Page!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=513926896) * [Video of a competitive game of OAA](https://youtu.be/-Nu8FXF9DGg)  Open Angel Arena is a modern reimagining of the classic Angel Arena game mode. It was made by a group of passionate Angel Arena players that grew unhappy with the current iterations on the workshop. So we took it into our own hands to remake the game from scratch revisiting old features while modernizing and streamlining the gameplay. It is a highly competitive game and there is a lot to learn. If you plan on joining the tournament I recommend you start practicing soon.  * **Most heroes are viable** including supports casters and tanks. In fact supports are absolutely essential to many strategies. * **All items are upgradeable**. This allows for a wide range of possible item builds and for an even wider range of possible strategies. Have you ever wanted to play attack damage Elder Titan using the 100% lifesteal talent or use Lunas ultimate to rain death and stuns on an entire team? In Open Angel Arena these strategies are not only possible but actually viable.  * **New custom items** designed by the community and carefully balanced before being added. * **Bosses have been redesigned to be an integral part of the game and have been made more interesting**. To upgrade items you have to kill bosses often as early as 10 minutes into the game and then regularly for the rest of the match. A killed boss respawns as a new stronger boss with new abilities. Bosses in OAA have various mechanics that you will have to deal with while battling them and arent simple DPS tanks. * **Duels have been redesigned to include objectives that encourage players to fight and enable objective based gameplay**. There are multiple different duel arenas that you can be placed into and you will always be playing in a duel. If there is a 1v1 in one arena there is also a 4v4 in a different one and so on. * To win the game you must win a Final Duel. **The first team to 100 points will trigger a Final Duel. The team with 100 points then needs to win this Final Duel to win the game**. If they dont then the games score limit gets extended by 10 putting it into overtime. This goes on until a team wins a Final Duel. * Fountain camping has been eliminated from the game. * [Our custom music is amazing!](https://soundcloud.com/user-238514931)  Open Angel Arena is an open source project. There's lots of cool stuff we have designed if you'd like to help create them check out [our GitHub](https://github.com/OpenAngelArena/oaa). We are always looking for new people to help with the game. Its a fun experience and if you are a new developer the best experience you can get is to simply work on a game. If you work on Open Angel Arena you can also get feedback on your work by professional developers. You can find the developer discord in the installation instructions on GitHub.  We look forward to having you play in the Open Angel Arena Anniversary Tournament and even if you don't play we hope you enjoy watching it!  ### What's happening until then?  * We are still working on the game and a few small features will be added before the tournament. The balance of the game will also be adjusted mildly. But these changes will be made a reasonable time ahead of the tournament so you have at least a few weeks to practice. * We will soon release our [first custom hero](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19A8S42MtunAp7q9YHn7u3drwlc26rzyDO6iRoI0p5YY/). This hero will not be allowed in the tournament so don't worry about that. But if you feel like giving some feedback on the guy that would be great and very helpful. * In all likelihood we are going to be hosting a second fundraiser soon. This time not all money will go to the prize pool but instead we want to use some of the donations to help push the development of the game by using it for bug bounties and administrative fees like running the website. Donations from this second fundraiser will receive ingame rewards through our upcoming free Bottlepass. The fundraiser will be held on my [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/l34Um1). * We have our version of a Battlepass the Bottlepass releasing soon. This will include MMR and unlockable cosmetics some custom made.  ### We hope you'll give our game a shot. Lots of great and passionate people have worked hard to make it a truly fun and competitive experience!  Edit: We have reached 16 sign ups! Only 16 secure spots to go!,workshop

7.07 and the Frostivus Custom Game Contest,self.DotA2,"Hey  I am one of the developers working on a game for the [Frostivus Custom Game Contest](http://blog.dota2.com/2017/09/frostivus-custom-game-contest/). I'll keep this short and to the point if you have any more questions I'll gladly answer them.   There are 2 weeks left until the deadline. 7.07 released a week ago 3 weeks before the deadline.  Creating a well made game in little over 2 months is an insane task almost impossible on it's own. The recent patch broke many essential parts of the game essentially invalidating a ton of work that has been done on the contest entries. An example of this is the change to ""RespawnHero"" which is used to modify the respawn times of heroes something that almost every existing custom game uses.   The people participating in this contest are largely already active members of the Dota 2 modding community. We have existing custom games many of which were ruined by 7.07. This puts us into a situation where we have to choose between fixing our already existing games or continuing work on our Frostivus entries. Abandoning our current games for up to 3 weeks basically means letting them die completely since the player base will be long gone by then.  I have a question and depending on the answer a request:  While the deadline for the custom game contest is the 20th does that mean that the development for the game needs to stop at that point in time? Are games judged on their state on the 20th? Or are we still allowed to continue updating and patching? The phrasing in the rules is not clear here as it only says that the submission needs to be finished by the 20th.  If yes then that's great. An extension of the deadline would still be fantastic but this is already a good start.  If no then an extension of the deadline would be appreciated. Give us another week to allow us to fix the damage 7.07 did not only to our Frostivus entries but to the entire Arcade.",workshop

Sneak peek of Dota IMBA's upcoming 7.00 update,self.DotA2,Hello r/dota2!  Dota IMBA has gone without updates for a somewhat long time now (months!) because we have been preparing a BIG update to bring the game up to par with Dota 7.00. The current version is a patchwork solution that *works* i.e. doesn't crash and is playable at least but we feel it didn't adapt well to Dota's 7.00 paradigm change at all.  One of the things we made to actually make the game *close to 7.00* instead of just a 6.88 clone with talents duct-taped in was our own take on the talents system. [Here is how it works:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OJ5DgVC_YU)   - Heroes' maximum level is 40 by default. Normal abilities have 7 levels while ultimates have 6 (learnable at 6 1218 24 30 36).  - Heroes can pick one of 6 *generic* stat-only talents on levels 5 15 25 and 35.  - The available *generic* talents change from hero to hero; for example casters will usually have at least 1-2 options between CDR spell lifesteal cast range or spell damage amplification.  - Each *generic* talent can only be picked once; if you pick cast range at level 5 for example you cannot pick it again at 15.  - Finally generic talents are stronger if picked later in the match; for example picking a spell damage amplification talent at level 5 might grant you +10% damage while waiting until 35 to make the same pick would give you +25% instead.  There are also *unique* talents. these are a binary choice - pick one out of two - that can be made at levels 10 20 30 40. All of them change a hero's abilities in some way (sometimes pretty dramatic). For example at level 40 Axe has the option of increasing his Culling Blade's kill threshold by a massive **400** or to give it +650 cast range allowing him to leap from far away to dunk fools.  Overall we hope these additions can allow you to play the same hero multiple times without getting bored due to the increased flexibility and maybe even give vanilla dota some ideas as has happened before.  For those who already play IMBA worry not: we didn't spend all those motnhs just making a pretty little talent screen. We basically rewrote the game from the bottom up. All heroes have been at least slightly reworked from their current IMBA versions. You'll have a good time figuring out the new combos and crazy things that can be pulled off!  ---  IMBA 7.00 is coming **soon** (tm). We expect a release sometime next week if no unforeseen roadblocks present themselves.  /u/D2imba (Firetoad previous IMBA developer) /u/shushishtok (Thunderlizard current IMBA developer) and the entire development team wish you good luck and have fun!,workshop

Can we bring the attention of Valve to the Dota Hattery please?,self.DotA2,We all know Valve reads Reddit way closer than the emails or the dev forum so i just wanted to point out that the amazing http://dotahattery.com/ is nowhere near the service providers list (Service providers can get a percentage of sales out of Valve share if the item gets in).  It's a service lots of both Dota players and Dota workshop artists use regularly and it keeps money and effort to keep it up updated and running. if we can make it appear on the service provider list it will not only be a boost to this actual service but will incite other services to grow and maybe get on the list too.

Pure Reflex and some inside information!,self.DotA2,Hi there I noticed a lot of people have come across Pure Reflex popularity has grown and many pro players are testing out their reactions. With the communities help Pure Reflex has risen to a top 20 game and has very positive ratings 73646 (80% of total) which is huge in the Dota 2 community.  Just thought Id let the community know what my opinions are in the current state of custom games. I know Im not that known around here but I thought Id just give my two cents. Ill also be updating with more updates/opinions closer to spring so be sure to give my Twitter a check.  Anyway as eSports are growing I feel there is a need for games where players can grow challenge and express themselves. I feel Pure Reflex is great for this. All players start on an equal footing there is no randomness conditions are the same for everyone and the outcome is decided by Pure skill ad reaction which is extremely important in eSports.  It is now my opinion that it would be best to create a standalone game and publish it on steam. I have a lot of experience in developing games now and am currently working at Gameloft. I have also received a lot of job offers from companies in Europe and participated in the development of a few games that have been released. Here are a few mods Ive created for Dota 2 specifically over 3 years.  http://steamcommunity.com/id/mocherad/myworkshopfiles/  Unfortunately though there has not been any support from the Valve/Dota 2 team in all this time. There are a lot of unfixable issues in modding currenly for example implementing an MMR system is impossible. We also have no way to deal with leaves. I dont hate Valve for this I actually plan on working at Valve sometime and if not Valve hopefully Blizzard! Id also like to say Valve actually has very good devs for example the CS: GO Valve team is very good. They helped a lot with the level design competition with CS: GO. However the Dota 2 team seems to have a lot of problems not sure why either. I feel like the community has lost a couple of years progress with custom games which is a shame as we have lost a lot of the custom games player base of the years. I feel like I could be a big help to Valve in this situation.  Due to these reasons I plan on creating a standalone game of Pure Reflex and upload it on steam. I plan on adding everything I had wished to add to my custom game on Dota 2 but was not able to.  A rating system a. Players have always given feedback that they cannot find players of similar skill. This is both a problem for new players and veterans. Tournament system a. Organisations should be able to easily make a tournament (it will take few minutes 5-10 to create) Different game modes a. FFA deathmatch etc Replay system AI bots to practice on your own  At the moment I am planning the roadmap for my game. I am doing a GDD interviewing future employees (3D 2D artists programmers and animators) I also have a well-known studio in Asia that is interested.  As for Dota 2 mods! Dont worry I wont stop creating the community! For more details and official announcements please follow my personal twitter where I will post all the info. Also I am looking for beta testers if you are interested let me know!

The first ORPG addon (v 0.55),self.DotA2,HeyGuys. I'm glad to present to you my **ORPG** (online role-playing game) addon. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=562659280  This addon is going to consist of several maps which you will be able to play depending on your hero's level. It's inspired by lots of MMORPGs but will also try to have it's own zest.  **It has working:**  - 1 map designed for 1-10 leveling (aiming to have 45 or 60 level cap);  - **Save and load system!;**  - **Hero to hero trading!;**  - **Custom inventory;**  - **Crafting system;**  - Custom items (equipment usables and loot);  - Enchanting;  - Custom quests tabs;  - 3 fully done heroes;  - 10 levels of creeps with custom aggro system and wandering function;  - 1 party boss (accessible through a quest);  - 7 quests;  Works best with 16:9 screen ratio (for now).  Data wipe is going to take place somewhere at beta.    **What it aims for:**  - To have **endless gameplay** and be **infinitely replayable**;  - To have passion inducing atmosphere - to **be farmed** **get epic loot** and **fight with other players** in arenas or dungeons;  - To force players to **team up** to get the said epic loot;  - To have interesting lore and a storyline;  - To be a little mmorpg inside the DOTA 2 with servers up to 20 people;   **Screenshots:** http://imgur.com/a/swWcF  It's still a **WIP** and lacks a lot of content but bear with me - i'm working on it solo and try to make it perfect at least as i see it as much as i can.  Follow my twitch channel to be aware of any upcoming streams support the project and help to change and balance the map in chat discussions. http://www.twitch.tv/ambassador601  I think enough time has passed and enough changes were made since i posted this on reddit for the first time.,workshop

I am a custom game creator and i cant even join my own game anymore,self.DotA2,Hi everyone  Today my friends and I tried to play our custom game [Battleships](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=302491959) which we have been continually building and balancing for the last three years. Unfortunately we discovered that there seems to be an unannounced level-based restriction on playing custom games that prevents nearly all of us from joining a lobby.  We dont really play DOTA2 proper which means were all low level but have spent a lot of time improving and debugging a game that now has ~200000 subs and ~150 weekly players. Its a great way for us to stay in touch as our lives move us around and hopefully provide a fun game for the community :).  Does anyone know the details of this restriction or how long it might be in place? It appears that this is a response to a problem with bot spam its just frustrating to spend so much time making and playing a game only to have it taken away with no information alternatives or timelines. Thanks!   tl;dr We cant play our custom game and would like to be able to.,workshop

Hey R/Dota2 after listening to your great critiques we are finally ready to release our courier SQUIRE SNORTS THE OMNIPUG! Take a look!,self.DotA2,[SQUIRE SNORTS LORE: Now in Video Form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95lR10Q2mts) by edje!   [Steam Workshop Link!](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=479158872)    Hey guys!   A few months ago we came to you with our beloved pug courier project. Me and Vlad both have pugs and have always wanted one in game so this is our attempt to add some snorts into Dota 2. As such its been a passion project for both of us and we are really pumped to launch him today!  ***Whats New?***  Our biggest critiques last time were:   1. The wierd looking refresher orb: this has been replaced with a new little pouch to hold your tangos and mangos and a little clarity. [here is his new model](http://gfycat.com/GleamingExemplaryInsect)   2. Not enough animations and a static face: we have added several new animations and more life into the face (blinking and moving tongue) [animation showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg8e-5d3B_w)  3. Only 1 pug color: We have added Dire Black pug!   Overall we are both really happy with the way he turned out! Thank you so much for being a part of it with us.  ***Whats next?***  Well you can vote for the pug to see it in game or you can leave us a comment here about any improvements you might want to see or critiques. Last time you guys had great feedback and while we might think we have everything we could want this time you might have more suggestions. Overall we think Squire Snorts would make a great addition and we hope you do too!  Thanks for reading and see you in the trench!    and as always a picture of my pug [Mr. Roo](http://imgur.com/1k2ooaK),workshop

I believe it's done by placing a texture over the eyes but I may be wrong. The whole Amber Queen set is fantastic but I think the eyes in this case look very out of place.

It is done!

It's called Dota Classic and here's the Steam Workshop page:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725837387  Search on the in-game arcade for ""Dota Classic""  It has some bugs - it's the very first beta after all and I've only tested it against AI so far but all the orginal mechanics are there:  * All items fully shareable * Killing a barracks stops the respective production * Secret river shop * Morbazan (secret quest) * Special items tied to scourge/sentinel  All original heroes ported with the exception of four (they will get ported too just a bit later). Sniper's ulti is different than in the originalwill be changed later. Leshrac needs some modifications as well.  All items (except one: infravision dog coming soon) all spells and the old layout! The xp/gold mechanics however are not a perfect replica of the original for now. That's coming in a later version.  I will monitor this thread for feedback and I hope I get lots of it.  Please be aware that it's not going to be 100% replica in all areas that's simply impossible given the engine differences.  EDIT: I played with a few people and there were some stability bugs (I've never tested it with others before) Please bear with me I will fix the issues. Please report disconnects.  EDIT: Leveling seems to be fixed now. I needed around ten minutes to reach level six against AI that's the same as in the original. Killing heroes might give still too much xp however.",workshop

An analysis of DotA2 players' profile pictures: increasing number of accounts with anime display images correlates with declining sex rates and rising female hero pick rates among those accounts.,self.DotA2,**TL;DR: Users with anime display pictures are on the rise in DotA2; correlating with decreased sex rates and population decline.**  What we choose to have as our display picture in Steam and therefore in-game DotA2 can say a lot about us as individuals.  Whether it is something that holds meaning or is just a funny meme joke that picture was deliberately chosen.  That choice is particularly noteworthy when large swaths of the player-base begin making the same one.  Im speaking of course of anime display pictures. You know it I know it we all know it anecdotally speaking there seem to be more and more players with anime display images out there every day. Therefore **this study seeks to define the proportion of the DotA2 player-base which has used anime profile pictures over time and further to determine any secondary effects associated with this phenomenon.**  In order to establish whether or not the number of users with anime display pictures (henceforth referred to as ADP) was on the rise I developed a computer algorithm with the capability to parse Steam community data.  Ultimately the algorithm returned data which included the following criteria: Steam profiles and display images for all accounts which had at least 20 hours of DotA2 on record for a calendar year.  Data was collected for calendar years September 2014-2015 September 2015-2016 and September 2016-2017; thus yielding 3 time points for analysis.  Further a separate algorithm obtained from an otaku (anime enthusiast) enthusiast web-board was able to analyze all collected display pictures and separate anime and non-anime pictures/users into two groups.  Simple percentages could then be calculated by dividing the number of ADP profiles by total profiles which yielded the results below:    Calendar Year| Percentage of DotA2 players with ADPs ---|--- Sept. 2014-2015| 12.3% Sept. 2015-2016| 16.9% Sept. 2016-2017| 20.2%   As many of us have come to expect from our own in-game experiences the data do indeed support the notion that **there are a growing number of ADP users in DotA2**.  In and of itself you might think this doesnt mean very much: so a reasonably large percentage of our user-base has the same category of profile pictureso what?  Theres no harm in that right?  On the contrary the ADP trend observed in DotA2 is reflective of a larger more impactful trend which has emerged in the past decade. [ The Routledge Handbook of Sexuality: Studies in East Asia](https://books.google.com/books?id=oUGDBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA215&lpg=PA215&dq=men+increasingly+dating+anime+characters&source=bl&ots=MHP5pwr3XN&sig=ZHoAFJBR-1L8KA4l-bCzcuGFrSY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjP6LnM5ZrWAhXG3YMKHXqeDAoQ6AEIWzAL#v=onepage&q=men%20increasingly%20dating%20anime%20characters&f=false) reports of concerns about the orientation of desire toward fictional characters and sexual preferences for them.  The Handbook further goes on to say Among otaku an alternative system of value has emerged based not on productive roles at work and home but rather on consuming manga anime and games and sharing affective responses and attachments to fictional characters.    [Multiple](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/young-people-japan-stopped-having-sex) [reports](http://www.businessinsider.com/half-of-japanese-people-arent-having-sex-2015-7) have come out [documenting](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/japan-sex-problem-demographic-time-bomb-birth-rates-sex-robots-fertility-crisis-virgins-romance-porn-a7831041.html) the decline in the number of young Japanese people having sex which has serious consequences: Japanese death rates are outgrowing birth rates; the population is in decline.  While there are many factors at play here many point to the rise of attachments to fictional characters as being a significant contributor to stagnating sex rates.  As [this article](https://thoughtcatalog.com/pierce-nahigyan/2015/11/how-pornography-is-changing-millennial-men/) states Virtual sex is much more convenient and virtual women pillows stamped with the images of anime characters and sexual Real Dolls have become popular enough that there is an entire subculture of men dedicated to them  not only in Japan but in America as well.   With the data on ADP I have collected so far I next **sought to determine whether ADP players displayed tendencies of attachment towards fictional characters**.  A simple Google search of dota2 waifu returns countless message board discussions of which hero is the best waifu (fictional wife) so it seems logical that ADP users might be more inclined to play female heroes.  To this end I compared the pick rates of female DotA2 heroes for ADP accounts versus the overall pick rates reported on dotabuff.  If ADP players pick female heroes at a higher rate than the overall population it is suggestive of an increased desire or affinity to these fictional characters.  Results are reported below in Table 2.    Table 2| Broodmother| Crystal Maiden| Death Prophet| Drow Ranger| Enchantress| Legion Commander| Lina| Luna| Medusa| Mirana| Naga Siren| Phantom Assassin| Queen of Pain| Spectre| Templar Assassin| Vengeful Spirit| Windranger| Winter Wyvern ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---- Overall Pick Rate in Dotabuff| 3.46%| 12.71%| 6.52%| 15.66%| 3.89%| 17.30%| 12.13%| 9.11%| 5.94%| 16.78%| 3.29%| 25.14%| 9.94%| 9.41%| 8.01%| 9.12%| 16.95%| 2.57% ADP player pick rate| 4.82%| 20.23%| 8.21%| 17.70%| 5.13%| 18.64%| 15.36%| 11.49%| 7.35%| 19.02%| 8.18%| 26.67%| 14.52%| 10.73%| 14.40%| 12.86%| 20.29%| 4.13% Difference in ADP players| +1.36%| +7.52%| +1.69%| +2.04%| +1.24%| +1.34%| +3.23%| +2.38%| +1.41%| +2.24%| +4.89%| +1.53%| +4.58%| +1.32%| +6.39%| +3.74%| +3.34%| +1.56%   Strikingly **ADP users picked all 18 female heroes at a higher rate than the overall population**.  There are certain obvious favorites among ADP players in their choice of waifu; Crystal Maiden Templar Assassin Naga Siren and Queen of Pain seem to be particularly popular.  On the whole this data suggests ADP players are more likely to pick female heroes and as such their likelihood to become attached to these or other fictional characters reduces the likelihood that they would pursue real relationships over those perceived to be happening in a fantastical pseudo-reality.   **In conclusion there has been a striking increase in the number of ADP users in DotA2 over the past three years.  Further study of ADP players revealed a propensity to pick female heroes suggestive of an attachment to fictional characters.**  This pattern mirrors real-life issues of declining interest in sex and resulting population decreases in some populations.  The correlation between ADP users and decline in sex rates is a trend that is expected to continue over the next few years ([as this graph depicts](https://imgur.com/a/1t5MI)) although further study is required to determine direct cause-and-effect relationships between the two.    Thank you for reading and I look forward to your comments.        ,article
Overview and simple analyse of an boosted/bought account and why it is ruining this game.,self.DotA2,I just finished a game where the enemy midlaner is an account buyer. Before the horn some1 on my team says 'oh look at sf's profile'. i clicked it and see full page of losses with only one green. and [his profile looked like this.](http://imgur.com/a/qGQEh) btw that's seriously the worst looking pentagon i've ever seen.  now we pointed that out in allchat the enemy team decides to put pudge and ogre mid to babysit their sf. and without much surprise sf did have a jumpstart because of that. but the rest of the game is just a walk in the park. SF went SB and while he did manage to get some surprise kills with his ult he then proceeded to buy Ethereal blade and didn't show up for almost every TF.  [This is his dotabuff page](http://www.dotabuff.com/players/339996749)  [Here's the analyse of his profile](http://imgur.com/a/rbpgL)   All the green boxes are when his acc is getting boosted spamming 8 heros over 70% winrates with ridiculous KDA in ranked games. The boosting server was EU/Russia you can see that he has a winrate of 68% on those servers.  Now there's a period of 15 days of inactivity that's when they had to find a buyer for the acc. Then this guy bought it he has 9.09% winrate over 33 games played on USW.  Look at those red dots and those green dots it just can't be more obvious.  [here](http://www.dotabuff.com/players/339996749/matches?date=all&region=us_west&timezone=Pacific%2FPago_Pago) you can see that he has a catastrophic KDA of 1.25 while averaging 8.88 deaths per games after he bought the acc. not to mention that while he plays mostly core heroes he has an avg GPM of 316 and avg XPM of 348.  Going 3-30 in those games. that's 27*25 = 675 MMR lost. So it means that he had 5700 MMR the moment he purchased it. That's just extremely unfortunate for his teammates because that's easily 33 games ruined. even the 3 games he won his KDA is only 22-41-58.   I wanted to report him but i m out of report. he will prolly ruin 40-50 more games (so his mmr reaches 4k) before abandoning this acc to buy another one. it just is really unfortunate if ppl like this end up on your team. also it's causing MMR inflation in the long term.  EDIT : all the haters including actual acc buyers can downvote me all u want but the problem will always exist even u ignore it.   the only reason ur downvoting this is because ur either an acc buyer yourself or you support the act of acc buying/boosting.  EDIT 2 : if any MOD decides to take this down for any reason plz PM me or tell me how should i change my content so it doesn't violate any rules. i've been told that a post like this is not allowed .,article

A mini-analysis of Mercedes in DotA2: using hero lore to identify the hero most resembling a Mercedes-Benz E400 sedan,self.DotA2,"Before I begin I'd like to shamelessly plug my new [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aDotA2Analyst) (@aDotA2Analyst).  If you are so inclined I'd be happy to have your follow if not then have a nice day! Thank you.  Without a doubt the most talked about aspect of the ESLOne Hamburg 2017 major has been the Mercedes-Benz E400 sedan.  It has stolen the show. Therefore in the interest of finding deeper understanding and relationships between DotA2 and the E400 sedan this analysis seeks to identify the heroes which most resemble the smooth ride and quality you've come to expect from Mercedes automobiles.  You might be saying to yourself ""that's an easy one! Surely a hero like Gyrocopter who rides around in a machine is the most similar to a car!"".  That would be a careless mistake. Are Toyotas Chevorlets and Volkswagens not all cars? Indeed they may be machines but none of these truly compare to soul and history of a timeless Mercedes-Benz.  Thus to appropriately capture the essence of Mercedes it is necessary to consider the personal identities and backstories of heroes and not their physical appearances.  To this end I decided to directly compare the lore of the E400 sedan:  > The most intelligent E-Class family of all time welcomes a powerful new member to the dynasty. The E400 Sedan model arrives this year boasting a 3.0L V6 biturbo engine producing 329 hp and 354 lb-ft of torque  the same powertrain that currently drives its E400 Coupe Cabriolet and 4MATIC Wagon cousins. Paired with the 9-G-TRONIC 9-Speed automatic transmission and DYNAMIC SELECT it promises a bracingly smooth way to experience uncommon luxury. Naturally the 2018 E400 Sedan continues the tradition of E-Class brilliance. Harmonizing advanced automotive intelligence with awe-inspiring interior design its first-class furnished cabin puts our advanced vehicle systems right at your fingertips  even as its world-class innovations continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of automotive intelligence. ""Car-to-X"" Communication enables the E-Class to exchange information with similarly equipped vehicles  effectively allowing it to ""see"" around corners and through obstacles to detect potential hazards. Driver Assistance Systems  including Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC Active Steering Assist and Active Lane Change Assist  feature intelligent cruise control: They help keep you between the lines and can even help you shift between them. Inside the E-Class cabin provides an environment of pure comfort and responsive technology. Flowing lines and vibrant screens provide a striking visual display while touch controls aromatherapy and tailored seats indulge all of your senses at once. It's a vehicle that demands to be driven and more than lives up to the dream. Look for the E400 4MATIC Sedan at your Mercedes-Benz dealership this winter with an MSRP of $58900. >   to all 113 heroes' lores as described on their bio sections on the official DotA2 website (http://www.dota2.com/heroes/).   The two strings of text were then subsequently compared using an [online tool](https://www.tools4noobs.com/online_tools/string_similarity/) to measure the percentage of similarity between the E400 sedan and an individual hero's lore.  [See example here.](https://imgur.com/a/D03Nr)  I will briefly present key findings below and paste all available data at the end of this post.  First let's look at the mean median and mode values of the percent similarities between all heroes and the E400 sedan (see below).  It becomes fairly clear why Mercedes chose to advertise during ESLOne when looking at these basic statistics.  Strikingly the average hero has a 40% lore similarity to the E400 sedan! Truly DotA2 and Mercedes-Benz are a match made in advertising heaven.  Comparing all heroes to E400 lore| Value ---|--- Mean| 40.01 Median| 39.95 Mode| 39.95  Of course the devil is in the details.  Interestingly there is little variability across all heroes with most having similarity values near 40%.  However that doesn't mean there weren't those that didn't stand out as particularly similar or dissimilar to the E400 sedan. See the next two tables below for the top 5 and bottom 5 hero resemblance scores.    **TOP 5 HEROES WHO MOST STRONGLY RESEMBLE A MERCEDES E400 SEDAN**  Hero| Percent Similarity to E400 ---|--- Centaur Warrunner| 42.08 Pugna| 41.24 Phantom Lancer| 41.19 Chen| 41.11 Lycan| 41.04  **BOTTOM 5 HEROES WHO ARE MOST DISSIMILAR TO A MERCEDES E400 SEDAN**   Hero| Percent Similarity to E400 ---|--- Faceless Void| 32.86 Disruptor| 39.74 Enchantress| 39.79 Gyrocopter| 39.8 Juggernaut and Sand King|  39.81  Some quick impressions of these data: I don't think it surprises anyone that the swift bold movements of Centaur Warrunner strongly resemble that of an E400 sedan in motion.  Indeed many of the top heroes possess those elements of speed (Lycan Phantom Lancer) and control (Chen Pugna) which exemplify a Mercedes-Benz automobile. And look what we have here to the wise-guys that thought Gyrocopter might be most similar? We find him in the bottom 5 with other clueless heroes that can't appreciate the beauty of the E400 sedan due to obscured vision (Faceless Void Disruptor Juggernaut Sand king) or just have an irrational hatred and fear towards cars in general (Enchantress).   In conclusion based on the overall high-rates of lore similarity between the E400 sedan and DotA2 heroes (40%) the advertising campaign during ESLOne can be considered well targeted and thought out.  In the future a more pointed approach can be taken to incorporate some of these data.  Perhaps Mercedes could include Centaur Warrunner as a feature in their next commercial for a DotA2 event--this would surely play well with the audience.  Thank you for reading and I look forward to your comments.  (Oh yeah and that raw data I promised: https://pastebin.com/TrSdv9va)   ",article

An analysis of Pugna's wiggles: random gyration or evidence of in-game non-verbal communication?,self.DotA2,"**TL;DR: Pugna's hips don't lie.**  Hello everyone  It goes without saying that communication is a critical determinant of success in DotA2.  Ideally in game voice communication allows teammates to plan strategize and execute without confusion or guess-work.  Less optimally built-in features such as X hero is missing! can be used to get across the most necessary information to teammates.  One area of communication that is often ignored however is hero body language.  Often we think of body language as subtle cues however many living creatures use body language as a means of communicating important information.  Honey bees for example use a complex system of steps and gyrations known as the waggle dance that illustrates to hivemates about direction and distance to flowers containing pollen and nectar.   While DotA2 lacks any necessary bees to waggle there are notable instances of wiggle.  In order to further study the body language communication of DotA2 heroes this initial investigation seeks to explain the potential significance if any of Pugnas series of wiggles during his ultimate spell Life Drain.  In order to assess the importance of Pugnas wiggles I picked a small sample size of Pugna replays: 100 games played by individuals spanning multiple MMR brackets where  Pugna was played as a ""Core"" hero.  The Life Drain spell which channels for a total of 10 seconds can be deconstructed into different phases based on Pugnas specific series of wiggles which can broken down into the following steps seen in the table below:    Unique Wiggle Stage| Undulating beckon 1| Undulating beckon 2| Preparatory positioning wiggle| Releases the lean back major wiggle| Conclusion of major spastic wiggle with thrust| Snaps back to reality with one final motion to stop the wiggle like a conductor waving a baton| Motionless ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|---- Length of stage in seconds|  1.41s| 1.81s| 1.27s| 2.01s|  1.46s| 1.29s| 0.75s    To test the importance of each of these unique wiggles I studied each team fight in which Life Drain was used in each game.  A team fight was described as a skirmish between at least 3 heroes of each team for the purposes of this study.  For each fight I looked at each enemy or allied hero that Pugna cast Life Drain on and recorded which wiggle stage was ultimately reached for each ultimate.  I also recorded the result of each team fight tallying whether Pugnas team or the enemy came out ahead.   For example in one fight Pugna uses an ultimate on one hero that lasts until Undulating beckon 2 and loses that fight.   I was then able to calculate the percentage of fights won for each stage of wiggle.  The results are summarized in the table below:  Unique Wiggle Stage| Undulating beckon 1| Undulating beckon 2| Preparatory positioning wiggle| Releases the lean back major wiggle| Conclusion of major spastic wiggle with thrust| Snaps back to reality with one final motion to stop the wiggle like a conductor waving a baton| Motionless ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|---- Number of team fights (wins)| 114 (35) |163 (51) |181 (88)| 157 (80)| 87 (49)| 28 (18) | 11 (9) Percentage of team fights won|30.7%|31.3%|48.6%|58.6%|50.9%|64.3%|81.8%  As the results above suggest there is a trend towards more successful ultimates in later wiggle stages.  Based on these findings I propose novel interpretations of each unique wiggle stage:  **Undulating Beckons 1 and 2:** Many fights are lost at this stage; Pugna may be urging on teammates to help with what appears to generally be a lost fight.  **Preparatory positioning wiggle:** Having asked for help Pugna focuses on himself and announces that he is preparing for the upcoming major wiggles.   **Releases the lean back major wiggle:**This is the big one.  It is clear to teammates that Pugna is really letting it all out at this point putting his bet foot forward and doing what he can to win the fight.  **Conclusion of the major spastic wiggle with thrust:**Perhaps becoming overly-confident with himself after the success in the previous wiggle stage Pugna's exuberance and bragging is apparent to both enemy and ally as his ultimate becomes less effective.  **Snaps back to reality with one final motion to ""stop the wiggle"" like a conductor waving a baton:** Seeing the error of his ways Pugna rights himself by signalling that both these wiggles and the team fight as a whole are over with one quick ""cut"" motion (see high win percentage).  **Motionless:** At this point Pugna's complete lack of movement shows how little he and his team must do anymore the fight is all but won.  This pilot study which will need to be bolstered by larger data sets introduces a novel example of body language communication by a DotA2 hero.  Further analysis into other variables such as the impact of Aghanim's Scepter also warrant exploration.  I look forward to your comments and thank you for reading. ",article

The International on front page of NYT,nytimes.com,,article
Envy,self.DotA2,I imagine a good number of us know who EternaLEnVy is.   The carry for Cloud 9 is quite a character. Hes built a cult of personality around himself this painfully awkward boy who likes anime far too much and has never made a conservative play in his life (or maybe he just habitually misspells and misreads BKB as MoM). EE-Sama as we affectionately call him is one of the most polarizing players in professional Dota 2 -- He is a reckless fool; he is an avant-garde genius. He is a quiet thoughtful engineer; he is the angriest most try-hard flamer in the scene. He is a socially inept loser everything about our games community that is to be roundly condemned   He is everything that is best about Dota.   I am a C9 fan. I will tell you why that is.   Do you know Envys story? In 2011 Jacky Mao was an Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto (my own school coincidentally enough). He had an A average as he had maintained for most of his life. By his own admission he didnt know anything but Math Science random shit anime and video games. He decided he wanted to play Dota professionally so he dropped out.   Who throws away a promising future like that to go into one of the riskiest industries in the world? By this point Jacky EternaLEnVy Mao was a moron and the commenters in his Team Liquid thread announcing his decision had no problem telling him so (http://www.liquiddota.com/forum/dota-2-general/454226-going-on-leave-from-university-to-play-dota-2).   U sound like u need a psychologue and not quitting school and being stuck infront of a computer alone all day.   Reconsider what makes u happy in life and seek some help - Darkren   His journey went surprisingly well to start with EE found himself at the helm of the rookie squad No Tidehunter as its Hard Support and Captain. At its zenith this team included Envy and four now familiar names: Loda S4 Admiralbulldog and Akke. The Dota 2 scene had never heard of NTH when the quintet burst onto the scene and began winning tournament after tournament starting with Dreamhack Winter 2012. NTH was arguably suddenly unparalleled as the strongest team in the scene. It looked like Envys doubters would be proven wrong.   Then they kicked him.   Dota doesn't have much of a future. At least not one that's worth throwing away yours for. - MichaelDonovan   On February 22 2013. EternaLEnVy was removed from No Tidehunter and replaced with EGM. On April 22 the No Tidehunter roster joined the Alliance organization and renamed itself accordingly. Envy watched his rechristened former team continue to dominate Dota 2 until August 11 2013 when Alliance as you almost certainly know raised the Aegis of Champions above their heads champions of The International 2013.   And Envy watched.   On September 19 EE now a carry joined PieLieDie bOne7 and Sing_Sing to form a new team Kaipi.   This was quite an obnoxious read. You seem to be quite the narcistic [sic] character confidence is one thing but having it too much is just annoying.   Also the others are right you should never leave school for gaming unless you are already having success at that moment. It's a terrible choice to leave school with the expectation that you will do well and make enough money with streaming. If you don't like your education go do something else or finish it and then go do something else but this entire plan is just rediculous. This bragging about engsci is also just plain annoying - Markwerf   Kaipi did not have any major success until it was picked up by Rattlesnake to become Rattlesnake.int (the organizations international non-Chinese squad) later renamed Speed Gaming.   At MLG Columbus with AUI_2000 as the teams 4 and the then up-and-coming Arteezy standing in for bOne7 Envy took his first major tournament since leaving NTH. Eyes wide mouth slightly agape as he lifted the trophy his teammates beaming at his side EE was a winner again. Things were looking up once more for the Torontonian Otaku!   Speed Gaming became Cloud 9 on February 9 2014 after news came to light that the players had not been paid for months. A name is only a name though fresh off their victory over many the best teams in the world at MLG C9 was prepared to continue to dominate in the months before TI.   Except they didnt.   Without Arteezy who had signed with Evil Geniuses Cloud 9 was condemned to mediocrity. Clown 9 rival fans called them derisively. The team with the stupid drafts that lacked any semblance of the basic mechanical skill needed to be successful at the highest level of Dota. C9 did not win a single major tournament in 2014 often placing as low as 5th-8th. Most painfully EEs team was crushed repeatedly by his old friends Alliance. Nonetheless they were invited to The International.   The way high level dota works is not in your favor. Most teams only recruit known players and its difficult to get on a known team just from solo play. Dota 2 does not really even have premier leagues right now so it'd be hard to get known that way too. Canada doesn't have a good international team and north americas best teams have historically not lasted long. Incredibly talented people like fear and hit0mi had to go to international teams for stability. I doubt you will be as good as them even with practice. If you can't get a team that succeeds in major tournaments you won't even get 500 viewers. Dota is a team game you can't do what you described in the op by yourself. - Ack1027   And tomorrow the Main Event of the most valuable tournament in the history of eSports will begin and EternaLEnVy will be a part of it.   He was never supposed to get there. He was just a stupid kid dropping out from university because he had no idea about anything in life. He was kicked from a team that would become world champions a few months later. His new team was worthless without Arteezy arguably the best player in the world.   But he is there.   lol kids and their fantasies.. what makes you think you will make it far? - Talent.L   Do you Do you remember growing up? Do you remember the times in your life when you had no friends? When all you wanted to do was sit at home and play video games and so often that was indeed all you did? Do you remember having dreams that were stupid and pointless and you got a desk job instead? Or maybe youre merely aspiring to a desk job instead now.   Do you remember being EE?   Cloud 9 is not supposed to win The International just like they were not supposed to make it out of the group stages of The International just like Envys professional Dota career was never supposed to go anywhere.   And maybe they wont win that $5000000. Maybe theyll bow out last place in the Main Event never going any farther than they are now. Maybe they are doomed to be the losers that people have insisted they are over and over again for almost a year now.    But on the off chance--   Hey EE-sama.   No mercy this weekend okay?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Correction: I incorrectly identified the roster of Kaipi at the time EE joined the team.  The KP roster then in fact consisted of: Arise bOne7 EE PLD and Zizou.,article
An analysis of Earthshakers ultimate: calculating the theoretical impact of echo slam on a major city,self.DotA2,The Earthshaker according to lore was once of the earth but chose to walk upon it.  Legend says he was born from the aftermath of an earthquake a fitting birth for this apparent cow-man (self-given name Raigor Stonehoof).  Each of Earthshakers unique abilities reflects his origin; with magic totem in hand he splits shakes and cracks the ground beneath him.  (As an aside there is some confusion as to Shakers exact species as the name Stonehoof suggests ungulate but the Enchant Totem spell flair text states [Raigors gorilla strength can destroy mountains](http://imgur.com/a/cBkW4)but perhaps this mystery is for another analysis).   Earthshakers ultimate ability Echo Slam presents a unique opportunity for study.  While it is difficult to imagine how some heroes abilities might translate into our lives (think Sanitys Eclipse) an earthquake is the real-world equivalent of Echo Slam.  Therefore in the following analysis I will outline a method to calculate the magnitude of Echo Slam and the likely damage it would have on a major metropolitan hub.   To this end I needed to establish a way to translate units from DotA2 into a usable metric for equations.  Fortunately this conversion has already been studied[ by /u/antezante and later improved upon by /u/DarkMio](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1vaklc/how_big_is_the_dota2_map_really/) who came up with the following proof: 1 block = 1 meter.  One block in DotA2 for clarity is equal to 64 units (see: 14080 units/220 blocks = 64 units per block).  Using this information I could now calculate the radius of Earthshakers ultimate in meters.  Echo slam has two distinct radii[ as seen here \(circles not drawn to exact scale but are for example\)](http://imgur.com/a/Hyn4i).  The first 600 unit radius is the initial damage range while echo waves of damage are sent out from each unit hit by the initial damage which also have a radius of 600 units.  Thus echo waves can reach as far as 1200 units away from where Echo Slam is cast. Using the conversions from above 1200 units is equal to 18.75 meters (1200 units/64 units per block = 18.75 blocks = 18.75 meters).    Knowing the radius of the Echo Slam directly allowed me to calculate its magnitude using the following formula: radius (in meters) = e^ ((magnitude of earthquake/1.01)-0.13)*1000.  This formula is simply a best-fit estimator as we cannot use traditional more accurate seismographic measurements for Echo Slam.  While it cannot reproduce an exact as-measured magnitude the formula does yield a reasonable estimate within plus or minus 1 magnitude.  As a proof of principle allow me to demonstrate using a real world example.    The most powerful recorded earthquake is thought to be the famous [1960 Chilean quake which released as much energy as about 20000 Hiroshima atomic bombs](https://geovisualist.com/2015/06/08/the-1960-chile-earthquake-released-almost-a-third-of-all-global-seismic-energy-in-the-last-100-years/)wow!  Its effects were measured as far away as Japan putting estimates for a radius at up to 17000 kilometers away. With this fact I used the above formula to calculate [a theoretical magnitude based on a 17000km radius](http://imgur.com/a/nHDvX).  The resulting calculated magnitude of 9.97 is within the range of error and less than 0.5 away from the [actual recorded magnitude of 9.5](http://imgur.com/a/wwTLq) demonstrating the accuracy of this equation.   Thus I could simply plug in the radius of Echo Slam into the same equation[ to determine its calculated magnitude as seen here](http://imgur.com/a/15dAB).  The calculated magnitude of -3.79 (plus or minus 1) does initially pose some questions.  Is it possible to have a negative magnitude earthquake?  It turns out yes!  As earthquake magnitudes are exponential a negative magnitude isnt negative per se but rather a very small value (think 10^-1 power = 0.1).  In order to get a sense of how much energy is released by a negative magnitude earthquake [my research led me to some of the top minds](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/33gxw6/til_an_earthquake_can_have_a_negative_magnitude/) at the /r/todayilearned subreddit.  As /u/perpetual_entropy states a magnitude -3 drops to 2 J (Joules) which is about the energy you use to lift a small bottle of water from a table to your mouth.    This was indeed an unexpected finding.  How could Echo Slam an ability that can cause such damage and chaos in game release the same amount of force as a jumping 2 millimeters into the air?  There are two possible explanations.  First it could be although I believe it unlikely that the method I have used here is not an accurate way to measure Echo Slams magnitude.  However the formula checks out with the 1960 Chilean quake so it should apply equally well to Earthshaker.  The second possibility although unsavory to accept is probably the more accurate: DotA2 heroes are extremely susceptible to small amounts of force and are in essence weaklings.  Dont believe me?  Head over to Thesaurus.com and enter in weakling.  [What synonym did you find?](http://imgur.com/a/V6Ryg)  Dotard? And the [definition of dotard](http://imgur.com/a/6x4eu)? Synonyms; [faltering floundering trembling weak decrepit](http://imgur.com/a/ynznR)I think Ive said enough.  How else do you explain Dark Seers punch doing damage? As sorry as I am to admit it our heroes are puny shams susceptible to the forces it takes to pick up a [kid sized plastic water bottle](http://imgur.com/a/1PPhj).   Thus I can conclude that Echo Slam would have no discernible impact on a major city.  Its extremely weak energy output aside the tiny radius would only affect a very small portion of said city.  You might be asking what about the damage amplification for each unit in Echo Slam?  Okay even so maybe youre lucky and you hit an area where there are 50 people crammed together inside the 18.75 meter radius maybe now they felt like a man the sized of /u/siractionslacks- slapped them on the back. Really devastating.   Thank you for reading and I look forward to your comments.  --Edit--5 times as many page views on the kid sized water bottle than the initial equation example...smh...   ,article

"""Gifting"" has destroyed our once reasonable cosmetics community.",self.DotA2,"When a product is offered that contains more or less random items it's naturally going to occur that people aren't going to get the item they want. Most people's first course of action is to trade theirs for the one they want. This is readily observable in any community with randomization of goods. I've done trades in card games video games and a fair amount of trading in Dota 2's market. Hell I see kids trading those wretched Shopkins on the sidewalk. Remember Beanie Babies? Right.  Well for several [perfectly justifiable reasons](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/34kx7c/regarding_gifting/) Valve has put a substantial time limit on new cosmetics for trading. Specifically all the new immortals from the International are un-tradeable/marketable until September. Almost three months.   Currently we're on the third chest related to the International with a third *Immortal* chest on the way. There are a *whole lot* of people out there who didn't get the set or Immortal they wanted and that's perfectly fine. What isn't fine is that those of us unhappy with our random contents are having to resort to ""gifting"" to solve what should be a simple common sense problem.   Gift-trading is a real show let me tell you. r/Dota2trade has seen a massive increase in fraud reports as people (unsurprisingly) run off  once gifted an item because *somebody* has to go first and trust the second party to follow through with their ""gift."" People are having to check lists of reputations compare played hours and posting history on Reddit in the hopes of not being preyed upon.   Before people get their hackles up about it being ""gifting"" and not ""trading"" you're dancing around semantics. The simple fact is that there is a mechanism remaining for trading items with high demand for trade but it **simply is not trustworthy**. Valve would not have left even ""gifting"" if they did not *intend* it as a temporary means of trade while they try and sort out their compendium fraud issues.  TLDR; Trade restrictions are too long gifting is broken and too easily scammable. Don't trust people on the internet.",article

Wanna say something regarding the recent visa issue with Boston Major - From iG CEO,self.DotA2," Hi all many of you may know already on the 16th of November our team iG.Vitality went to the US visa interview and got team wiped (along with some of our friends in LFY). This thing has been really bothering me and I feel like writing something down.  Let's start with the beginning of this year in order to prepare for the 2016 season of Dota2 we have made 2 teams: iG.Dota2 the team led by iG.Ferrari_430 and 4 new players to the scene and the other team iG.Vitality which is the one I would like to elaborate in detail today. This team was led by Paparazzi along with InJuly an offlane player who was fading away from the pro scene; dogf1ghts a new support player we have acquired from VG; super a support player from the iG.Dota2 squad; and last but not the least two mid players OP and Sakata rotating on the mid position. After OP has moved to iG.Dota2 the remaining 5 players formed the current squad of iG.Vitality.  If you would like to ask me what's special about this team I think none of these players when the team was formed were considered as tier 1 player. Apart from Paparazzi who is the first Chinese 8k MMR player everyone else either had the experience of being abandoned by a club or were just a pub player and had no pro experience therefore at the beginning no one thinks this team will be successful. And I can tell you that this is the lowest cost team under iG organization even lower than our junior training team. However this exact same low cost team started to shine after mid-year and attracted bunch of attentions even acquisition inquiries from other organizations. Another fact of this team is that all team members have good temper and they love group activities. I think this is the team with the best team environment that I have seen. And that's why the team came to me and said they would not like to have adjustments even after failed to attend TI6.  Now let's move forward to the Chinese regional qualifications of Boston Major. As most of you know there will be only 2 majors apart from TI this year. Whether you look it from the honorial perspective or purely the prize pool the Majors are considered as one of the most important tournaments. Needless to mention how difficult the Chinese regional qualification is as well as the past results of the Chinese regional qualifiers we are proud that iG.V were able to qualify through it along with LFY and earned this precious spot. Looking back at when the team was first formed and comparing to what this team has achieved now I think only these boys know what the hell has happened.  After we have qualified the first priority to us was to start the visa application. I have already heard many stories about US visa being rejected this year and realized how difficult it will be. Back when iG had fewer staffs I were the one getting visas of many different countries for our players. If I remember correctly there was only one time we have failed attending an event due to visa rejection it was to Sweden and the reason was the invitation letter was not original copy as well as there was no return air ticket which were all due to time limitation that the organizer couldn't get the files mailed to us in time. However I was still optimistic regarding obtaining the visas when plenty of time was given.  Every time when we participate a Valve event Valve would provide us a very detailed folder of documents helping us preparing the visa application. These includes and not limited to: contact in US hotel in US sponsor for the expenditure(including name and address) air ticket for round-trip flights background of Valve company background of the game Dota2 information of the Boston Major and etc.  Therefore as soon as we have received the materials from Valve we have started filing the visa application immediately. Me along with our COO Zhili(who got PhD in US) and iG.V's manager qingjiao (who was an international student in UK) double and even triple checked all the applications. And we also did bunch of mock interviews just to prepare the players. However unfortunately they still all got rejected and this is what happened on that day:  On the morning of the 16th qingjiao and the players went to the interview. Qingjiao went up first and was asked the purpose going to US he said ""Our team has been invited to attend the Boston Major you can find our information online and here's the invitation letter."" the officer said he doesn't need to look the invitation letter however he did ask some information of the tournament and the game he also asked if he came with the team qingjiao said yes then he got approved.  At that point qingjiao was pretty optimistic for the rest of the team to pass. The next was Dogf1ghts after some chat the officer asked Doghf1ghts if the rest of the team members are behind him and asked them to all come up together. From what the players told me they were still feeling pretty well at that time until the officer asked if they are all high school graduates they said yes except for InJuly and no further question from the officer anymore. A few moments later they were informed that they all got rejected without even a chance presenting the materials they have prepared.  Talking about diploma I'm unsure how much it would influence the officer's judgement. It is true that most of our eSports players dont have higher education degree however maybe that's why they could put more focus on gaming and became a top eSports player. Don't misinterpret me I'm not saying education isn't important in contrast I think education is super important. However I can also not change the fact that the eSports scene is filled with players who don't have higher education. And I don't think education degree should be a decisive factor for approving/denying visas how unfair would it be to not allow people entering into US just because he doesn't have a college degree?  Anyway what I think isn't important. After we have failed to obtain the visa on the 16th things spread out quickly on Weibo and Reddit. Some blame Valve for having the Major in US even though they know the difficulties of obtaining US visa; some blame the ACE organization not doing anything helpful; and someone was wondering why LOL players dont seem to have such issue. Well from what I have heard Riot has registered LOL as an official sport category therefore players were able to obtain P1 professional sports player visa (and Dota2 players have to apply B1 tourism visa). However this is just speculation and I have yet confirmed with Riot. But this is not what we should concern at this point since it's impossible for Valve to do this within 10 days.  Regarding Valve I personally think they have done a lot for us already and we are truly thankful for it. Valve has a very experienced employee who is dedicated to handle all the visa related stuff including providing all the necessary details that would be needed for visa application as well as all the air tickets. As for ACE organization I don't think they can do too much here even though they have contacted me yesterday and asking if they could help anything.  Back to the topic I have been thinking WHAT DO THE OFFICIAL REALLY CARES ABOUT?  If he is questioning our purpose we have an invitation letter from Valve a world-known software company who promises to be responsible of all the cost of our US trip and all we do is just to participate a gaming event.  If he is questioning us retaining in US I can say the probability is 0. As someone said on Reddit ""This never happened before and will not happen"" also to quote someone from SGamer ""These kids dont even know English and don't have any ability that can sustain their life apart from gaming what can they even do in US?"". Not even to mention there are countless tournaments and matches waiting for them after they have returned back to China along with their families and friends.  In the original Reddit thread there was a poste said ""How does the visa system work? It doesn't make sense to me."" I think this is the question that's really on point but then who can give an affirmative answer?  At this point I feel like I had to do something maybe it would be meaningless but I have to do it. I would like to ask the US embassy officials please at our next interview at a look at players invitation letter take a look at all the documents Valve have provided us take a look at their employment verification letter and pay stub instead of remaining silence after just viewing their basic info. All we want is just to participate the Boston Major and we will return back to China immediately. I just hope you can please give them a little bit more consideration before making decision because this is way too important to them. Thank you.  I would also like to thank you for reading this and thank you for sharing this rough time with us or maybe also start worrying about our players. Regardless of if you are an eSports fan or someone from the Media or a Pro player or anybody in the scene as long as you care about eSports I hope you can share this article.  We have already arranged an urgent visa interview that will take in place on the November 22nd 14:30 and this might be their last chance. We will really appreciate your help no matter what it is.  Last but not the least we hope our players Paparazi/Chengjun Zhang Sakata/Zichen Xu InJuly/Xiaodong Yang dogf1ghts/Tianpeng Gao super/Peng Su and our friends from LFY can obtain this US visa and attend Boston Major.  Thank you.",article

An essay on the Cheese in Dota 2 and its probable real-world models.,self.DotA2,According to the Dota 2 Wiki the Cheese dropped by Roshan was 'made from the milk of a long lost Furbolg vendor'. This would indicate that the cheese was produced in bear territory as the Furbolg were a race of bear-men. If we are to follow this further into the realm of Dota 2 and not Warcraft the lore of both Lone Druid and Ursa give no clues as to their geographical origins save for Ursa's 'wild wooded homeland'. The Hellbear camp was originally known as the 'Polar Furbolg Ursa Warrior' which could also hint to a race of arctic bears but this is unlikely to be relevant as most cheeses are fermented at warm temperatures and the bacteria cultures required do not survive well in the cold. According to CultureCheeseMag.com Northern societies generally favour savoury cheeses with thicker rinds primarily for use in hot dishes such as Gratin Fondue or Raclette. Therefore the icon for the [Dota 2 Cheese](http://imgur.com/7BihwMz) is undoubtedly far from examples such as the autumnal [Rogue River Blue](http://imgur.com/NnoYSvJ) or the [Rush Creek Reserve](http://imgur.com/kvRoicx) produced in Wisconsin.  As a result we are led to believe that the Dota 2 Cheese was manufactured in wooded bear country. One might think at first that the cheese was modelled on [Edam](http://imgur.com/grM5McD) as the colourful rind is similar and the cheese itself is traditionally moulded to fit a roughly cylindrical shape with slight rounding which bears similarity to the curve of the outward face of the cheese. Moreover Edam does not spoil according to 'A History of Edam' from edam.com and instead hardens. This would again support the lore presented by Dota 2 as it is understood that Roshan has held the cheese since his decision to kill a shopkeeper to claim the Aegis of Immortals. The holes in the [icon](http://imgur.com/7BihwMz) also appear to have held up over time. However the Edam theory can be disproven by the disappearance of bears from the Netherlands where the cheese is produced due to hunting and habitat destruction such that the latest records indicate that they existed outside of captivity no later than the 11th century. A similar conclusion can be applied to Gouda also a product of the Netherlands.  Alternatively [Emmental](http://imgur.com/edyUl2V) is a Swiss Cheese a country that would certainly fit the description 'wooded'. It is similarly hard and holey and could also be applied to the Northern Furbolgs due to its use in molten cheese dishes as mentioned above. However it is an unpasteurised cheese which impacts its longevity and means that it must be eaten after a mandatory ageing period of at least 60 days (where US federal agencies are concerned) but before it spoils which makes it largely unsuitable as a model for Dota 2's cheese. In addition it is widely agreed that it's taste is at most 'mild' whereas the Dota 2 Wiki suggests that the cheese 'restores the vitality of those who taste it'; Emmental is clearly no smelling salt of the cheese world. One might also think of Swiss Cheese if Emmental is unsuitable or more specific examples like [Jarlsberg](http://imgur.com/ZjY2Unt). The texture is evocative of the Dota 2 icon and the taste 'sweet and nutty'. Nonetheless in Dota 2 the rind is clearly a reddish-brown colour that resembles the paraffin-wax coating of Edam and not the traditional yellow wax of Jarlsberg.  Another possibility for the cheese's real-life counterpart is [Tilsit](http://imgur.com/In8230N) a semi-hardened 19th century cheese from modern day Northern Russia. As a versatile cheese with many different applications variations can be used to support the image presented by the icon; pasteurised and non-pasteurised variants account for the colour of the rind and what is more it is the most strongly flavoured of the cheeses discussed thus far. In Dota 2 a [green odour](http://imgur.com/7BihwMz) can be seen emanating from the cheese and in reality Tilsit is often made with caraway seeds and peppercorns using 'smear-ripening' (by which the cheese is scraped against another cheese during fermentation to aid the development of bacteria) to give it a pungent scent and striking taste. Finally bears in Russia are known and iconic primarily the brown bear and the Kamchatka subspecies (although not native to the Westphal valley of Tilsit origin). Therefore in terms of cheese properties it is perhaps the most accurate although aspects of all the cheeses mentioned so far are common to the Dota 2 cheese.  A final point of consideration is the cost of the cheese; in Dota 2 it can be sold to the shopkeeper for 500 gold but this begs the question of the real value of the Dota 2 currency. First and foremost the sum paid to the shopkeeper does not represent its true value as other items can be returned at half of their sale price. As a result we receive the figure 1000 gold. However the market operates as an oligopoly with two shops accessible from friendly territory and two more from across the river Fag. Thus the four-firm concentration ratio is equal to 100% and the market share of any one shopkeep 20%. Due to their stationary posts there is no evidence for collusion and thus in the short run the industry acts as a [monopoly](http://imgur.com/4Rg6Uqb) with the theoretical sale of cheese where marginal cost = marginal revenue and making supernormal profit PmXACY by charging above the cost of production. According to Michael Salinger of Columbia University concentration ratio and profit margins can be linked through [these](http://imgur.com/zRZXYXb) formulae however there are simply too many unknown variables for the establishment of a Cournot model and a strange situation develops where the elasticity of demand is tied to production due to consumers also being the producers of the cheese (in taking it from Roshan). As such this line of reasoning is inconclusive.  However the penultimate name of the cheese as listed by the Dota 2 Wiki was 'Hunk of Cheese' which gives us some sort of scale to consider.  If basic items such as a Tome of Knowledge (book 150 gold) Courier (trained donkey 100 gold) and Boots of Speed (boots 400 gold) cost fixed amounts they can be related to the dollar although these examples show the Dota 2 universe operates with a different perception of value perhaps due to the existence of magic. Using amazon.com as a model (online retailers tend to have lower market power due to greater consumer information and contestability thus prices are closer to marginal cost of production) a simple search for 'men's boots' (as the style used in-game most closely resembles hunting and not fashionable boots) yields [these](http://imgur.com/erzd7nl) results indicating that most boots are within the $100-$200 range which I will round to roughly $150. Similar experiments for non-fiction and trained donkeys give a conversion rate of between 1:2 and 1:3.  Therefore a cheese wedge (or 'hunk') that appears approximately 1/6th of a round is holds value of roughly $800 in Dota 2 and around $2000 in the US. A 4kg wheel of Tilsiter costs 79.99 from thecheeseandwineshop.com or $103.24; disregarding second degree price discrimination a 40kg wheel would thus cost only $1032.4 or half of our desired value. A 40kg wheel of Parmigiano Reggiano from the same site costs a very close $1032.71. Therefore cost analysis is also inconclusive and the elusive $2000 medium-soft cheese of Dota 2 is currently unknown when taking into account the many factors that determine price.  Overall the cheese that most closely resembles the cheese dropped by Roshan in Dota 2 is likely to be Tilsiter the Prussian variety that accommodates for the item's subtle nuances in appearance and perhaps less subtly in flavour. Whilst both Edam and Emmental offer similarities they are both too rigid in their description and cannot be said to be the model of the fermented product displayed in-game. Although a fiscal approach is flawed for the most part I am confident that the process of evaluation taken in this essay has led to a correct conclusion regarding its identity.,article
DDoS in DOTA 2 for Dummies: Everything you need to know. With pictures.,self.DotA2,"[TL;DR](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/154/912/berneydidnotread.gif): Don't let **ANYONE** get a hold of your IP. Buy a VPN. Avoid Skype. If DDoSed reset router or call ISP to change your IP.  With DDoS being so popular right now in pro games I decided to write a guide on what it means and what it is for DOTA 2. So let's get started and I hope you find some of my advice helpful. **For the average player this guide is just information which they probably don't need. Pro-players should get informed and maybe use some of the advice.**   **What is DDoS?**  There are tons and tons of information you can google about this subject so I'll try to be brief: DDoS is an attack triggered by a computer or server that receives a target and the order to start. Once started [a network of infected computers](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/images/csc_child_pages/white_papers/ddos_fig02.jpg) will begin sending dead packets (useless data) to the target's router and hence blocking all sorts of communication. Imagine [a river flooded with trash and your router is trying to get rid of it with a shovel](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20100802/00221917f7600dc04ded0d.jpg).   **How does it happen?**  First things first. In every DDoS attacks there are only two things that matter:  *Service provider: The attacker first has to find a DDoS service provider or as they are called nowadays: ""Stressers"". They are paid services and their prices depend on the amount of time they want to DDoS you for and how much bandwidth they offer (possible amount of trash they can throw at your router).  *The target: A target is identified by its IP address. If they have it they can DDoS it. The attacker may encounter port problems but with enough dedication he WILL find the spot.  Once they have your IP they can use the DDoS provider to send trash packets to your router and eventually make your connection so painfully slow that you'll think you're disconnected.  So if one of these salty assh* gets their hand on the Dota 2 server's IP and they happen to be renting a DDoS Service then [this will probably happen](http://i.imgur.com/oGrtFRk.jpg).   *Note:* Picture taken from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/31n2rm/this_was_just_stupid_volvo_pls_bristle_paused_at/).   **How are IPs leaked?**  This is probably the most important part about DDoS. If there is no target then there is nothing to DDoS.  Now Valve server IPs are extremely easy to find so even scriptkiddies could DDoS the servers somewhat easily. So how do you find the IP?  *[You can ask Dota 2 to give you the IP](http://prntscr.com/6qfx0c).   *Even if they spoofed the server's IP in the console you could use a [Packet Sniffer and find it anyways](http://prntscr.com/6qg5uo).   Okay but that's for when Dota 2 servers get DDoSed what about **pro players**?   *Your IP can be found by using a Skype resolver. All they need to find your IP is your Skype username. Even if you're online the system will have your last used IP on file. [Example](http://prntscr.com/6qg27w).  *There are several other ways of finding your IP such as [Email sender IP](http://aruljohn.com/info/images/howto_yahoo2.png) ~~[packet sniffing Steam Voice Chat](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/919017593061261582/08BE37D3477D124CEAB3473183E81311D6381793/)~~ and probably any number of other ways that I haven't heard of yet.   **Example**  So I found a free DDoS service that delivers a 10mbps blow to your router (up to 200mbps I think) as a trial for their service. This free version is strong enough to take down most domestic networks.  But that's not all [see how incredibly easy it is to DDoS something](http://prntscr.com/6qg6r0). All you need is the target's IP and you're set.   **Protection**  We've reached the final part and before I continue allow me to tell you that I'm not a security expert and there may be several other ways to protect yourself from DDoS. So here we go:  * Rent a VPN. VPNs will hide your IP behind a strong and protected server. If you're chatting sending emails or using Skype for some reason make sure you're connected behind the VPN. You need to find one with a proper location either near you or near the target servers. I'd recommend PureVPN since it's cheap but there are literally hundreds of VPN providers.  * Limit your Skype usage. I know it's hard for pro players because most tournament organizers use Skype to communicate with everyone involved but yeah... as you can see all they need is your username and even if you're offline they'll find your IP. [This MAY help too.](http://prntscr.com/6qhv2d).  * Make sure nobody besides your team or friends know the Teamspeak server IP. Yes Teamspeak servers can be DDoSed as well.  * Make sure you don't have any stupid viruses installed on your computer. Most people think their computers aren't infected but you'd be surprised.  * Firewalls. Some routers have a built-in useless firewall. Windows also has a [useless built-in firewall](http://i.imgur.com/3fA05yq.gif) but it doesn't really matter since your router is the target. Anyhow I'm sure you can hire an IT expert to set up a firewall for your gaming house or CASTING STUDIO.  * Don't post on fishy forums. Mods and Admins can see your IP.  * More tips [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/31o9er/ddos_in_dota_2_for_dummies_everything_you_need_to/cq3fn57).  That's about all I know. If you know of more ways to protect yourself please feel free to post them in the comments so I can add them here with due credit.   **HELP THEY ALREADY HAVE MY IP**  Once the attacker has your IP and an attack is underway (you'll notice you're being attacked because your internet will stop responding).  Now does your ISP have dynamic IP?  * **Yes**: Close Skype and head over to your router and turn it off. Wait for 30 seconds and turn it back on. That should be enough time for it to get a new IP. Now go back to the previous section and protect yourself.  * **No**: Why the f*ck not? Okay whatever. Close Skype and call your ISP. Don't tell them you're being DDoSed unless you really really have to. Odds are that the person who's speaking to you won't know what that means. If he's clueless ask to speak with his/her administrator/manager/person in charge. Tell them you need to reset your IP because some website says it's blocking your IP. When you're done go back to the previous section and protect yourself. And also change your ISP to one that gives you a dynamic IP.  * **Alternative**: If hell is breaking loose you may [try this guide to reset your IP](https://instant-skype-proxy.com/create/step-7).   **Credits**  * /u/notR1CH for [his suggestions](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/31o9er/ddos_in_dota_2_for_dummies_everything_you_need_to/cq3fn57).  * /u/j0ffe for [MORE PROTECTION TIPS!](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/31o9er/ddos_in_dota_2_for_dummies_everything_you_need_to/cq3fn57).  I'm sorry if I'm missing someone this thread had a lot more responses than I expected.  **Closing remarks**  I'm also sick of watching paused games because of DDoS and I just want it to go away. You can't stop DDoSers but you can stop yourself from being DDoSed.  Also I wouldn't be surprised if mods deleted this thread like they did with those about scripters.   Any suggestions comments or feedback are welcome.  ",article

What's in a name: a look at how name length and pick rates are linked.,self.DotA2,TL:DR: We like short names.  Hi all  If you have read my past posts you will know that a lot of them try to make sense of the pick screen.  I am on a quest of sorts to shed light on what makes us choose the pick we choose each game.  For the most part I would pose this thought: are looks or what we can see on the pick screen the root cause of our choice?  Now it is time to take a new route.  Sure if you think of a friend your brain forms a view of them.  What else comes to mind?  Their name.    We are built to place names on things--- a cat dog tree man food drinkyou name it we name it.  Thus this post seeks to find out what sway if ~~any~~ at all names have on our picks.  **My guess is that short names are more in vogue than long ones.**  I base this on a trend to use short names-- John.  Mike.  Bob.  Dick.  All come from long names but these are used far more than their drawn out forms.  Lets jump right in shall we?  First I sought to count the sum of sounds each name has and ask if less sounds meant more picks (dont want to use hard to grasp words but if you want to know more on these sounds click [here](http://www.howmanysyllables.com/whataresyllables)).  To this end I took the mean of times picked for each group.    Stats are seen in this chart and bar graph:  Chart 1| 1 Sound (N=12 ex. Axe)| 2 Sounds (N=31)| 3 Sounds (N=43)| 4 Sounds (N=16)| 5 or more Sounds (N=8) ---|---|----|----|----|---- **Mean of times picked**| 99995874|78272604| 80259323| 76629869|78828320 [See graph here.](http://i.imgur.com/8xcc8SA.png)  From these stats **it seems we like as few sounds as we can have in a name (one)** while the rest of the groups have less times played and are all near the same mean.  Next I thought the words per name may show this trend too.  So as seen in Chart 2 mean pick rates were made for one word and two or more word names.  This test still leans to one word names though a bit less.  But when you look at just one word names you find that there are some that are in fact two words (War Lock Clock Werk etc).  Chart 2 has these mean pick rates as well **where it shows a more clear choice for real one word names.**  Chart 2| 1 Word Names (N=71)| 2 or More Word Names (N=39)| Real 1 Word Names (N=55) | 1 Word Names With 2 Words (N=16 Ex. War Lock)  ---|---|----|----|---- **Mean of times picked**| 81877197|80025013| 83055222| 77827735  Last to look at this in more depth I chose to test the length of the names (i.e the sum of all as bs cs etc. per name) to see if the same trend would hold that short names have high pick rates.  Mean pick rates are seen in Chart 3 for groups of name lengths:  Chart 3| Length 2-5 (N=23 ex. Axe)| Length 6-7 (N=24 ex. Clinkz)| Length 8-10 (N=21)| Length 11-12 (N=19)| Length 13-19 (N=22) ---|---|----|----|----|---- **Mean of times picked**| 91708911|75387836| 75059203|77706712|85346640  Still we see just what the past two sets of stats told us: **short names are what those who play like to pick**.  Of note the group with the most length is off a bit from what you might think.  Im not sure why it is a tad more than the rest of the long groups but these names may have found their way in to some hearts and minds due their strange length.    I end this post as it was at the start: **we use short names (John Mike) so it makes sense that we tend to pick short names in game as well**.  While this is a good start more tests and thought should go in to this fore it can be proved.   Thank you for your time and I cant wait to see what all of you have to say.      ,article
VPs Sneg raging at tournament organizers VP squads to miss a lot of events in 2015,self.DotA2,In case you didn't know Sneg is the owner of Virtus.Pro. Here is his recent statement at VPs website (translation is mine should be readable).  Title: **How to cure sick organizers.**  I already wrote that tournaments owe organizers huge amounts of money. Particularly I am talking about six digit numbers in USD. I'm done with investing in trips to tournaments organized by scammers. In 2015 all rosters of Virtus.pro will ignore leagues or tournaments that owe us money until these debts are payed out. We'll make an exception for tournaments that we already participate in. Dropping from such tournaments is a disrespectful towards the audience that bought tickets or just waits for our performance on streams.  We are also going to ignore all tournaments that won't sign contracts with teams. The contract that I'm referring to should include all participation details payment schedule and fines for breaking the contract.  I must point out that with such a strict approach Virtus.Pro will probably not participate in any CIS league because their organizers are the biggest debtors and scammers. V1lat is not paying anything for a few month already and simultaneously has the insolence to cry in Twitter that people stopped buying his tickets. In addition I won't send anyone from VPs coverage crew to such tournaments. As for Starladder the teams will participate in the current season but if the debt is still not payed until the first of February then Starladder will be ignored by all VPs rosters and media resources during entire 2015.  **Update**: Apologies by Sneg in comments:  After chatting with V1lat I must admit that I was wrong in this statement. V1lat covers a lot of stuff for the audience and negotiates with Valve but he's not responsible for payments. That's why my personal accusation towards V1lat is a mistake. I'm sorry for that. However everything else in this statement is valid.  **Update 2**: The debtors list by Sneg:  It's unfair to blame only Starladder. Here is the list of biggest debtors: ESEA Excellent Moscow Cup Techlabs Copenhagen games i-league.   **Source**: [russian post at virtus.pro](http://virtus.pro/participate/blogosphere/main/110699/)  ,article

3 Stats that show why you're still in the trench even though you tread switch.,self.DotA2,"We know we know you do everything /u/dota_asg posted in his 10 habits for playing dota.  You check the map and treadswitch and even pull! You try to buy situational items you get BKB you adapt your skill build to the enemy!  Yet you still break even.  You blame yourself your teammates the server the patch/meta whatever but still the fact is if you were really 1k or 1.5k better than your teammates youd find ways to win much more often than not.  &nbsp;  The problem is not your knowledge of the interaction between tread switching and hp or holding your skillpoint at 6 on WK to avoid blowing the cooldown on a hopeless double death.  **Being good at DotA is being efficient** and that comes down to much broader playstyle problems than whether you swapped int treads to blink it shows in GPM XPM Tower Damage and KDA.    This wall of text goes in to some detail on the game-wide stat differences between 2-3k players and 5k+ players Please note that this is not meant to be an exhaustive analysis (pulling case studies like the healing/min of Bounty Hunter or the current GPM difference of riki in 2k vs 5k is an encyclopedia unto itself) but it should illustrate how playstyle differences add up to produce very different game outcomes from the low to the high brackets.  *How to improve your numbers* cant be fully covered in a single post but you [can check out my sidebar guide on learndota2 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/48oqqn/mentalgeneral_improvement_tips_using_chess/) for some checklist-style thoughts on this topic.  The trench is not just a question of individual actions **but a core failure to play the game efficiently.**  Data for further exploration can be found at www.dotabuff.com/heroes/meta and in YASPs benchmark feature an excellent look at your global performance on key stats in a given game.  &nbsp;  **Bottom line up front / TL;DR: 5k+ Players play the entire game at a faster pace than other players**  Whether its moving to new farm taking objectives making rosh decisions identifying proper positioning using skills or deciding which items to buy the top 1% simply dont slow down.   For example I saw !Attacker (nearly 9k) on Tinker the other day; he got a kill top rearmed went bottom and marched the wave hit fountain and returned top within 30s or less; a 2k player might have gotten the kill but theres a great chance theyd go back to fountain spend 10 seconds planning the next move and miss the entire wave of creeps that the 9k swept up.  Every pause that a 2k takes is a hit to game efficiency where they should be doing something else.  You should always be ready and moving to the next item on an endless checklist of tasks and thinking ahead to the next method to gain GPM and XPM without also feeding that lead back to your opponents. DotA is not a game that is just against 5 human players its against the ancient on each side of the map. Play against the whole enemy team including their towers and creeps not just the 5 heroes.  &nbsp;  **1) GPM and XPM** is much higher in the 5k bracket even when considering losing teams  Take a look at the top 11 *differences in GPM* on carries between 5k+ and 2-3k.   **Keep in mind these numbers include losing teams this is strictly a measure of just how much faster paced a generic 5k player is over a 2-3k player.** At the extreme compared to a 2.5k player a *typical* 5k+ Naga siren has a full end-game item (or 2 cheaper items) over their counterparts at 30 minutes in to the game! Where the ~2.5k would have rad+Manta+travels+Aquila the 5k+ would have rad+manta+travels+Aquila+**Butterfly** (or heart octarine diffusal etc.) by the *same point in the game!*  *edit: a number of people have pointed out my ""Gold @ 30m"" stat is potentially a poor extrapolation on this data.  I do agree I took a liberty here but I don't think it affects the overall validity of my point. It is probably a slight over-estimate of the actual NW difference but it's hard to say since first 10/15m GPM of 5k+ carries (as noted in the excellent last hit analysis by /u/zeno) also means they spike much earlier than a lower tier player but do take that number with a grain of NA-certified salt.*  **Hero**|**2-3k GPM**|**5k+ GPM**|**Average GPM 5k vs 2-3k**|**Total Gold difference in first 30m** :--|--:|--:|--:|--: **Naga Siren**| 476.3| 654.5|178.14|5344.2 **Alchemist**|678.8|812.3|133.53|4005.9 **Meepo**|488.0|611.9|123.97|3719.1 **Templar Assassin**|466.4|582.1|115.69|3470.7 **Anti-Mage**|541.8|652.0|110.23|3306.9 **Invoker**|446.5|553.7|107.21|3216.3 **Terrorblade**|503.8|602.8|98.91|2967.3 **Lone Druid**|443.0|539.5|96.47|2894.1 **Morphling**|476.1|567.1|90.96|2728.8 **Luna**|519.6|610.3|90.71|2721.3 **Sven**|519.4|610.1|90.71|2721.3  Key notes here to drive home the playstyle differences: 5 of the 10 core GPM differences are heroes directly requiring micro management and of the remaining 6: Alchemist multiplies CS efficiency via Greed  TA AM Sven and Luna rely on varying types of spread attack damage which requires care to ensure last hits on every creep in a wave and Morphling requires manipulation of agi/str to farm efficiently and not die instantly to a gank.  Every single one of these carries relies on both precision and awareness from the player; not a tip or trick but the *consistent ability to maximize their farm over a wide area and soak as much GPM as possible.* 2-3k players lack this consistent ability to execute on being in the right place at the right time to maximize farm and fail to efficiently last hit in the mid game often losing 2 or even 4 creeps per wave to spilled cleave damage or poor micromanagement they are **awful** at AoE last hitting in the mid game and this is one of the most notable efficiency losses at lower brackets that isnt blatantly standing around doing nothing.  Notably some hard carries like Chaos Knight show little variation from 2-3k to 5k (+25 GPM) and are generally considered weak at high tiers and strong at low tiers thats because they lack the fast movement and flash farming of high-tier in-meta cores and rely on farming heroes; something much easier and more natural to 2-3k players where more gold percentage is derived from heroes/objectives than from creeps.  &nbsp;  More subtly lower tier players have a bizarre ability to avoid gaining experience.  Walking between lanes getting halfway to a lane switching ideas and going elsewhere. Teleporting to a Mexican standoff at a tower and **sharing XP 4 way when theres a free lane available**  **Hero**|**Average additional XPM 5k+ vs. 2-3k**|**Total XP difference in 30m (approximate)** :--|--:|--: **Meepo**|+112.66|3379.8 **Templar Assassin**|73.42|2202.6 **Anti-Mage**|70.79|2123.7 **Lone Druid**|68.85|2065.5 **Sven**|63.24|1897.2 **Invoker**|60.55|1816.5 **Clinkz**|60.51|1815.3 **Storm Spirit**|56.88|1706.4 **Tiny**|56.19|1685.7 **Outworld Devourer**|52.29|1568.7  A key takeaway is that this is ~1-2 levels per hero and that critical level 11 is achieved much faster.  Again keep in mind these are game-end statistics *(and include losing teams)* and STILL show a substantial increase again indicating the **faster pace of play and more efficient positioning around map resources** compared to 2-3k players.  &nbsp;  **2) Deaths** 5k+ fight and die less and their team deaths are distributed very differently  Eventually you will fight the other team. However 5k+ players do so less often (experiencing a team-wide average of 1.11 fewer deaths per hero and therefore a game-wide average of 11 fewer a ~15% total reduction) and when they do the carries are substantially less likely to die.  Carries represent ~8.3% fewer of total deaths in 5k+ than in <2k dying 1.6 times less per game than their sub-2k counterparts this substantial difference interacts with GPM and XPM by reducing time off the map and lowering gold lost and gold fed. **remember that this includes both winning and losing teams so we can reasonably conclude that the winning 5k carry dies even less!**  **Role**|**5k+ % of Avg. Deaths**|**5K+ % of Avg. Deaths**|**Average of &lt;2k Deaths**|**Average of 5k+ Deaths**|**Difference of Deaths** :--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--: **Carry**|95.33%|87.01%|7.36|5.75|1.61 **Jungle**|91.58%|88.08%|7.07|5.82|1.25 **Mid**|100.74%|102.16%|7.78|6.75|1.03 **Offlane**|102.77%|108.34%|7.94|7.16|0.78 **Support**|104.15%|107.83%|8.05|7.13|0.92 **Total**|100.00%**|**100.00%**|**7.72**|**6.61**|**1.11**  Even more substantially many 2-3k players complain about the comeback mechanics turns out theyre right to complain (but not because it's broken because they're bad!) they feed almost 1k gold PER PLAYER more than a 5k+ team of the same composition mid heroes in particular at high tiers feed their lead back much less. This reflects exactly in the 2-3k tendency to pick a powerful snowballing mid and then have no idea what to do with it after minute 20 resulting in foolish pick-off attempts that feed their lead well after theyve dropped off from a solo stomping machine.  **Role**|**Average of <2k Gold Fed**|**Average of 5k+ Gold Fed**|**Difference of Gold Lost** :--|--:|--:|--: **Carry**|4964.36|4173.85|790.51 **Mid**|5107.35|4430.67|676.68 **Offlane**| 4874.06|4164.96|709.10 **Support**|4557.64|3739.22|818.42 **Grand Total**|**4847.61**|4088.54**|748.68** **Teamwide total**|**24059**|**20245**|3814**  What this implies (and bears out as you climb) is that even of the deaths in 5k+ many more occur towards the beginning of the game after which players become much more careful about protecting their networth advantages.  The fed gold is a full item worth of gold fed to the enemy over the 5k+ bracket  Of course your team may insist on constantly fighting one of the things you cant do is just abandon your team to their fate so making a decision to enter a fight is key for all roles.  More important is the idea of gold lost on death and fed to the enemy team; preserving your lead without feeding and using unreliable gold instead of losing it on death can result in a massive change in GPM/Networth.  Picking heroes like Chaos Knight in order to fight early is one way to handle aggression. *Efficiently* split pushing to trade towers and without losing your own life is another way to overcome this hurdle.  Both method require learning to fill your role very well.  &nbsp;  **3. Tower Damage Per Minute** is significantly higher in 5k+ games  If you look at objective damage per theres a big difference here too. **Again this includes losing team tower damage so the relatively marginal overall difference should be put in context that even while including losing teams 5k+ carries are still doing substantially more damage to objectives than 2-3Ks!**  |Role|2K-3K Tower Damage/Minute|5K+ Tower Damage/Minute|Difference in TD/min  2-3K vs. 5k+   |---|--|--|-- |**Carry**|52.7|72.3|19.7 |**Jungle**|49.3|61.8|12.4 |**Mid**|29.6|36.4|6.9 |**Offlane**|19.4|18.1|-1.3 |**Support**|14.6|13.0|-1.6 |**Grand Total**|31.0|37.6|6.7  As we delve in to the data by hero we see that as with GPM two categories of heroes are notable.  One heroes that already push substantially in lower brackets do so MUCH more efficiently at higher brackets with TB in this meta being an utterly devastating force delivering 40% more Tower damage per second in the upper tiers of play and secondarily a bunch of heroes that are gankers  notable for being going beyond godlike and still losing in 2k-3k (LS TA Huskar Invoker).  In 5k+ those players have managed to find towers in addition to heroes and follow up their ganks with powerful and fast pushes on objectives.  **Hero**| **2K-3K Tower Damage/Minute**| **5K+ Tower Damage/Minute**| **Difference in TD/minute 2-3K vs. 5k+** :--|--:|--:|--: **Huskar**|45.0|103.0|58.0 **Lone Druid**|64.0|114.0|50.0 **Terrorblade**|103.0|147.0|44.0 **Meepo**|63.0|106.0|43.0 **Clinkz**|68.0|105.0|37.0 **Anti-Mage**|62.0|98.0|36.0 **Morphling**|60.0|96.0|36.0 **Lifestealer**|46.0|79.0|33.0 **Templar Assassin**|50.0|79.0|29.0 **Lycan**|90.0|116.0|26.0 **Drow Ranger**|84.0|110.0|26.0 **Invoker**|45.0|70.0|25.0 **Sven**|62.0|87.0|25.0 **Luna**|77.0|102.0|25.0  **Summary: what do I do about this?**  Theres a lot of subtle playstyle issues behind these numbers but the core lesson should be clear: **accelerate everything you do** When I say that I mean there should never be a point in the game where you have to think about what your next move is.  Literally every second you spend wondering which camp or lane to go to is a waste that 5k players have cut out.  Think about safety first but secondarily ACT get *near* a creep wave at least.  Get *near* a camp being farmed. See the guide I mention at the top of this post for some more practical checklist considerations.  &nbsp;  **A note on supports**  A lot of this focused on the core roles as their stats are more easily tracked.  Interestingly support players at 5k+ have **less** GPM/XPM and while they make up proportionally more of the teams deaths they still have strictly fewer deaths despite that I **do not** recommend poverty supporting at 2k just to emulate the upper bracket and the reason is with the core numbers discussed above the cores at 2-3k leave so many resources on the table that a support can pick up a ton of farm without ever coming in to conflict over resources with their carry.  As you rise you learn to do more with less i.e. have notable impact while 3 levels below your carry without also feeding yourself away in every fight. Your cores will react better to stuns and slows and use the farm you leave on the table for them more often.  Until you notice that happening focus heavily on gaining key items and levels to save your idiots or turn teamfights and work hard on proper ward positioning and self-positioning to avoid deaths and subtly direct your team to the right objectives.",article
The Burning Antimage.,self.DotA2,"The DotA Chronicles Page one.  The Legend of the burNIng Anti-Mage.  In Warcraft 3 Dota burNIng was the one of the so called fun-names of Magina who has come to be known as Anti-Mage. In honor of the greatest player of it in Warcraft 3 Dota. But in the Chinese communities Anti-Mage was burNIng. Coming into Dota 2 in 2012 the legend of the burNIng Anti-Mage would live for a little longer than we thought it might.  The first time we saw burNIng's prowess on Anti-Mage in the world of Dota 2 was in the lower bracket of the international 2012. In a best of one match DK 3rd picked Anti Mage into Darer's push lineup of Chen and Krobelus. burNIng ended the game 6/1/14 with 278cs in 28 minutes. This was the first glimpse the western world of DotA 2 had into the legendary Burning Anti-Mage.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejkQnvKYQeY Darer v DK.  Later into the tournament DK played the almightly and eventual winners iG in the lower bracket and picked up burNIng's Anti-Mage to compete with Ferrari_430's Queen of Pain and Zhou's Morphling. After a back and forth game it was leaning to DK with burNIng's Anti-Mage seeming unstoppable at an 8/0 score. iG took a rosh fight that would eventually dictate the end of the game. iG's charge into the pit was halted by DK's attempt to take the fight at the pit ending in a total wipe of iG and burNIng's Anti-Mage getting a triple kill. iG tapped out at 37 mins with burNIng ending 12/0/8 with 659 GPM. DK would however go on to lose the series with iG banning the Anti-Mage both games to take them through to the losers bracket final.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct6xljXnOLo IG v DK  Fast forward a year and burNIng was back on the main stage with a new-look DK Squad. After a group stage of 10-4 DK defeated iG and went on to face the invincible Alliance. Alliance were undefeated 14-0 in the groups and off a 2-0 win over LGD had not even lost racks in the entire tournament play. Alliance took game 1 after a 55 Minute bloodbath with Loda on Anti-Mage triumphing. In game 2 DK picked up the legendary burNIng Anti-Mage. Despite accruing an early lead with the Anti-Mage Alliance still had the staples of their TI3 teams the support naga the Akke chen the Bulldog Prophet. It was hard to believe in the Chinese being able to defeat their Swedish counterparts and after a 4 hero wipe-out from an EGM Song of the siren initiation the game looked like it had turned in Alliance's favour like it had for the entire tournament. After an Alliance high ground push was rebuffed just like the year before burNIng turned it in the pit. An EGM song initiation looked to crush DK in the pit after an Alch stun lands on two but DK turned it with a quick Super roar out onto S4's Dragon Knight and burNIng's Anti-Mage carving up side of Alliance and with three to fall they were rebuffed and burNIng grabbed himself an Aegis. Alliance managed to hold against the aegis of DK and pushed them out of the base. DK came right back pushing back into the Swedish stronghold as Burning marched up the high ground and was forced into BKB'ing Alliance popped the song from EGM and Netted him with no means of help from his team and no way to escape the Alliance hold looked like it was going to work.  ""He's still alive!""  With LD's famous words echoing through the hall burNIng stood tall manfighting against the side of Alliance crushing them under the blades of the Anti-Mage and for the first time in the tournament Alliance were up against mega creeps at the 45 Minute mark. DK stormed the ruined castle for the final time and they crushed through the last line of the Alliance defense to bring them down. The favourites had finally lost a game at TI3. The entire of DK deserved massive respect but the man who stood tall was the man behind the Anti-Mage.  11/2/9 816 GPM. DK would go on to lose the series and once again fall in the lower bracket of the International but burNIng's performance would live long in the memory of anyone who watched the series live. burNIng retired after the tournament marking the end of one of the most famous and most highly regarded players in the history of Dota.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ6O8--6BFs DK v Alliance  A year later however DK were back and so was burNIng. But the meta had changed so had DK. DK were completely changed into a legendary lineup with the SEA representatives IceIceIce and Mushi alongside the old support guard of LaNm and X!!! and with burNIng at the helm. For the style of play burNIng revelled in however the slow farming into lategame taking the fights when he wanted to winning on his Spectre his Anti-Mage and such. TI4 marked a deathball push meta where heroes like Natures Prophet Lycan Death prophet and Pugna were stellar picks in the position one role. Despite this however burNIng and DK advanced far into the tournament. DK after defeating LGD in the lower bracket sent there by a 2-0 loss against EG they came up against future finalists Vici Gaming. In game 1 DK pulled out the Anti-Mage trump card but VG were prepared playing a lineup with Leshrac and Pugna looking to crush the lanes before burNIng could ever get to lategame. No space was given to burNIng or Mushi's tinker in the game with an early Razor aghs coming out VG decimated the towers of DK creating an enormous lead. burNIng holding on for what little farm he could get. Until they finally had a chance. He jumped in massacring the Pugna and Prophet of Vici Gaming earning an Ultra kill in what was a miraculous teamfight with the help of the hex of Mushi. However it wasn't enough. VG came right back and crushed the base of DK under the sheer might of the split push and another International had escaped burNIng. DK.burNIng once again announced his retirement after TI alongside Xiao8 and rOtk.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAT2exkPPyU Vici v DK  Fast-Forward another year and after a return in DAC 2015 with the old guard of Chinese Dota all 3 returned to TI5 rOtk with his young EHOME squad Xiao8 with his mighty LGD team and burNIng Was not with team DK. For the first time burNIng was with Invictus Gaming the side that had defeated his DK squad in the International 2012. Alongside several members from that squad Faith Chuan Ferrari_430 they came into TI5 as hopefuls but after a terrible group stage score of 5-9 found themselves in the lower bracket a familiar place for burNIng. In round one of the lower bracket they faced MVP Hotsix and defeated them easily. They then faced the might and favourite for the tournament Team Secret. A wounded animal after their defeat to young EHOME in the upper bracket. iG turned to the burNIng Anti-Mage in the first game changing up their draft from what looked like a burNIng gyro to a mid gyro last picking the Anti-Mage. The game however didn't go to script. Secret rolled over iG through the entire game Arteezy's shadow fiend owning the game with S4's Storm Spirit. Accruing a 25k gold lead they marched up to iG's high ground at 45 mins. iG held superb play from Chuan and burNIng's Anti-Mage did the unbelievable and held their racks against the might of Team Secret. Charging to the pit iG took the roshan and carved up two of Secret seizing the moment and knocking at Secret's front door. However it was secret's turn to hold. They held the high ground several times before burNIng broke down the drawbridge Rapier in hand tearing the structures of Secret to shreds unstoppable he ripped the throne apart and a huge roar flowed around KeyArena. 8/1/7 673cs 756gpm.  ""Unbelievable!""  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b66Sv_taFs iG v Secret  As it happened all too often however for burNIng at TI the opposition ended up taking the series and burNIng spent time playing for VG. Moving to a 4 role and seeing his team fail to qualify for TI it looked like the legend had finally become just that a memory faded into the past remembered fondly but still in the past. However after returning to iG with a reinvigorated squad they won DAC 2017 and went onto the kiev major. In the new Swiss format iG played OG once again a powerful favourite for the tournament in a three game series. After taking game one for iG the Anti-Mage was pulled out. Could he still do it after all this time?  11/1/9 650cs 45k net worth and a thousand gold per minute.  I'm sure there are far more memories people have of the legend of the burNIng Magina but these are the ones that stick in my head from DotA 2.  Thanks for reading!

Team eHug - TI4 NA qualifier post-mortem.,self.DotA2,What a ride! Our players gave it their best but in the end it was not meant to be. We wish the very best of luck to all the teams who made it to the qualifier playoffs. We at Team eHug look forward to becoming normal fans again and we cant wait to watch the remaining games.  Whats next for the organization? We will sit down with our players and discuss the future. Our team will most likely be inactive until the end of TI4 but rest assured that we will be back as a new and improved eHug 2.0 soon.  Before we leave you tonight we wanted to state the organizations stance on some of the drama that has been surrounding the team.  - What was the deal with the forfeit against Union Gaming in our very first game of the qualifiers?  One of our players (Cak3z) had a real-life career obligation that was arranged before the qualifier schedule was announced. We had asked for a rescheduling but our request was denied. Our player tried his very best to make it but he arrived 31 minutes past the start time and the official rules state that a team whose members are not ready by 30 minutes past the start time must concede the game. This was just an unfortunate sequence of events. We fully accept the consequences and firmly believe that neither the tournament organizers nor Cak3z did anything wrong.  The organizers are not obligated to honor rescheduling requests. It is a privilege and not a right for players to participate in this tournament and it is completely reasonable to expect participants to free up their schedules to play. Furthermore given the sheer number of parties involved and the tight time constraints rescheduling games would be logistically difficult if not downright impossible. We would also like to note that even if another teams request is honored it does not mean that there is any requirement to honor every other teams request.  As for Cak3z his competitive spirit and dedication to the team should not be in question. From the very beginning he has agreed to play for us despite not receiving a salary nor the benefits of the gaming house. Even when the partners were openly auditioning for his replacement he continued to show up to every game whenever we needed him. He really wanted to make it to the UG game but alas real life obligations prevented him from doing so. He was surely bummed out more than anybody that the forfeit occurred. The team would not have gotten as far as it did without his stellar performance and we are very grateful for his service.  - Are we mad at Team Liquid for losing against Union Gaming?  Our players were shocked exhausted and justifiably upset when this happened as it meant that the playoff spot that they thought they had secured was suddenly up for grabs. Some of them publicly vented that frustration but then they quickly complied with our request to cease doing so. However those public displays had already made the rounds - even resulting in a front-page Reddit post titled ehug are MAD - and many were speculating on our feelings on the matter.  We as an organization wish to make our official stance abundantly clear - Team Liquid did not do anything illegal nor can they be blamed for our failure to advance. It is completely reasonable for their players to take it easy after a bunch of grueling matches and not reveal any strategies for the playoffs. They earned the right to be in that position by being a superior team. It is also a very serious allegation (not to mention disrespectful to Union Gaming) to claim that TL purposely lost the game. Their players are professionals and competitors and no team should have to face such scrutiny especially in the absence of evidence and motive.  We completely sympathize with our players for being frustrated and angry when they realized that they had to play more games after an absolutely brutal day. We apologize to those who took offense to those displays.  - What the hell was with our last Reddit post begging for help?  This was just an idiotic move on the part of the eHug partners. We did not consult with the players beforehand and ended up embarrassing them in the process by appearing to undermine their professional status. Our goal was to attract a bit of publicity for the team stir up some interesting discussions about the game and perhaps even find some original ideas. We did not intend for it to be construed as a sign of desperation or a pathetic plea for help. As soon as we realized the damage it was too late. We apologized to the players who were justifiably confused and humiliated. Theres no way around it. We really messed up - the post was in poor taste.  With that said we do wish to thank all of our supporters and well-wishers who overwhelmed us with their desire to help. Though we dont think any of the submitted ideas were actually seriously considered they were all read and appreciated. You guys may not be the best players or strategizers but you certainly are the warmest and most helpful.  We want to conclude this post by thanking the Reddit community for making all of this happen. We will continue to try our best to bring you a team that you can root for. <3  Good luck and have fun Team eHug  ************************************************************************************************  P.

Forbes Reviews Dota 2: 'Dota 2' Review: A Multiplayer Masterpiece 9/10,forbes.com,,article
My Findings on the Arrow/Jaren Case,self.DotA2,"Hi everyone I'm Tiffani ""Oling"" Lim. You might have known me as the manager for the Titan Dota 2 squad. As for now I'm just an active member in the SEA Dota scene and I'd like to share some of my findings regarding this Arrow / Jaren case here.      **Just a quick list for your reference:**  * Arrow Gaming Players: DDZ Lance Matteru Mozun & Xiangzaii.   * Jaren = Arrow Gaming manager   * Xiaoting = DDZ's girlfriend   * Hishiko = Lance's girlfriend    Let's begin.      ___ **I - Early Investigations**    A while ago I learnt from [Ren](http://www.reddit.com/user/PacificRen) & a few others of the possibility that Arrow Gaming is also implicated in the series of matchfixing incidents in SEA. I wasn't actively involved in the investigations back then just helping out when Dota2Lounge asked me some questions about Arrow Gaming and their gfs.     At that point in time D2Lounge didn't find the evidence available conclusive yet because the bets were placed via the gfs' accounts (and not the players') and the Arrow players found out that BTS was thinking of replacing Arrow Gaming in the Summit 2 as well. But both BTS & D2Lounge were careful and hesitant about this so nothing was released or announced yet.      ___ **II - Ren's Published Findings**    Finally 2 days ago Ren decided to publish his findings via [this Reddit thread](http://bit.ly/1nu6OF5). The way he did it was just to present the facts (bets by the gfs) and let the community judge for itself if Arrow Gaming really did participate in matchfixing.  Prior to this many were witnesses that both gfs posted angry FB statuses in an attempt to discredit such claims but as the Reddit thread surfaced all such statuses were deleted. The members involved and their gfs fell silent on social media.      ___ **III - The Cover-up Attempt**    Around 12am SGT yesterday I was chatting with a friend regarding this incident and I found out that she was approached by DDZ's gf earlier on for help in creating a coverup story & fabricating evidence. And soon enough at 3am this [thread](http://bit.ly/1t7Ekmp) appeared on Reddit and I was really angry that the players would actually go to the extent of creating more lies to cover up for what they did.   The Reddit post was posted by the user ""ArrowDDZ"" & was shared on DDZ & Xiaoting's Facebook wall. In the post ""DDZ"" not only denies any involvement in ""322"" activities supported it's claims with fabricated pieces of evidence but also launched a mini-section with personal attacks on Ren's betting history.   That's the reason why I was quick to point out that the evidence presented in the thread was fake ([tweet](http://bit.ly/1w1miDh)). And quickly enough people began to realize problems with the chatlogs and here are some that I've compiled: [1](http://i.imgur.com/Ksw5pSu.png) [2](http://i.imgur.com/mafmC54.gifv) [3](http://i.imgur.com/SUDMplD.png).  I presented my findings to the tournament organizers involved too. And around 4pm Jaren released a post on the Arrow Gaming Facebook Page wall ([post](http://bit.ly/1nxIsKx)) claiming that the Arrow Gaming management had nothing to do with the coverup attempt. The post was deleted yesterday night for some reason.  And around the same time I received a message from my friend & DDZ's girlfriend - the players wanted to make a public apology which includes a confession against Jaren stating that Jaren coerced them into this cover-up scheme. I agreed to help because I saw no harm in offering a public apology but I did not decide on which story to believe yet regarding the issue of who came up with the idea to cover-up the truth.      ___ **IV - The Players' Statement**    DDZ wrote his statement in Chinese and his gf translated the message into English. It can be found on DDZ's Facebook wall [here](http://on.fb.me/1CPoexC). Screenshot available [here](http://i.imgur.com/EkkXwc9.png).  Key points presented in the statement:  * DDZ and Lance admitted that they're guilty of matchfixing * The players as well as the two gfs involved offered their apologies to the tournament organizers * ""*we approached our management for help and we were advised to cover up for the sake of our reputation*"" * The Reddit post was written by Jaren in DDZ's name      ___ **V(a) - Jaren Xiaoting & Hishiko's Involvement in the Cover-up**    At the same time as the rest were working on the statement Hishiko was also sending some screenshots of her chats with Jaren to the tournament organizers. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/hri8FFt.jpg) is a compilation of everything she sent.  The first thing highlighted in red implied Xiangzai's involvement in the matchfixing itself. I'll talk about this in the later section titled ""The Matchfixing"".  The second thing highlighted in red and basically the conversation from then onwards showed that Jaren was not only aware of the cover-up but was also part of the few who came up with it. I managed to obtain more proof about this [here](http://i.imgur.com/4NH9fO6.jpg). This was a screenshot of the chat between Jaren and Hishiko on Skype that clearly shows the involvement of both parties in the cover-up story on Reddit.  Later on when I talked to Jaren about it he admitted to participating in the cover-up but claimed that Xiaoting was the one who came up with the idea. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/Erqftcd.png)'s a screenshot of our chat about it.  Here are the proofs he sent with screenshots of FB chats between Jaren & Xiaoting with [Jaren asking Xiaoting](http://i.imgur.com/iAAFfE8.png) to ""cough up good excuse"" in order to cover up the crime and the latter coming up with the idea of falsifying evidence later on: [1](http://i.imgur.com/cVUWE0l.png) and [2](http://i.imgur.com/8DLELP6.jpg).      ___ **V(b) - My Own Views Regarding Said Parties' Involvements in the Cover-up**    For the matter of the cover-up itself my view is that both Xiaoting and Jaren have plenty of reasons to want to salvage their reputation from this incident - Jaren is the owner of Dota Talk and quite a number of SEA Dota 2 tournaments and Xiaoting herself is a well-known personality in the Malaysian gaming scene. I was also told that Xiaoting was really worried about DDZ's reputation because the matchfixing was discovered via her Steam account and she felt guilty about it. So given the evidence I'd believe that both parties as well as Hishiko are involved and were just working together for the cover-up.   Regarding the players I really do believe what they said in the statement of being ""*afraid and lost*"" ""*didnt know what to do and how to react*"". I do have some screenshots given to me by their Assistant Team Manager showing that all 5 players met up with Jaren shortly before the cover-up post surfaced but there is no evidence linking any of them directly to the Reddit post. For the case of DDZ's Facebook account sharing the Reddit post I do know that both Xiaoting & [Jaren](http://i.imgur.com/TZmwSVa.png) have had access to his Facebook account.  As for Jaren Xiaoting and Hishiko I'd say it doesn't really matter who came up with the idea but as long as all of them had the motivation to do so and the evidence showed their involvement I believe none of the parties can or should be considered innocent in this.      ___ **VI - The Matchfixing**    I noticed in [this](http://i.imgur.com/JD5mOjQ.jpg) screenshot of a chat between Hishiko & Jaren that Xiangzai (""xz"") might have also been part of the matchfixing itself. So I decided to investigate further about the involvement of members other than DDZ & Lance.  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/nkbMiNJ.png)'s what Xiaoting said earlier today in a FB chat group regarding the involvement of other players.  Later on I had a [FB conversation with Matteru](http://i.imgur.com/MWhCq6g.png). In the chat he confessed that the entire Arrow Gaming team planned the matchfixing together and that it is NOT linked to anyone from the Philippines.   Here's a quick translation of the chatlog:  >Tiffani: Hi want to ask if you have any evidence of you guys participating in the 322? you or xiangzai/mozun >Matteru:  I can't give evidence now but we can admit it after all we planned this together. >Tiffani: Ok. Is this related to the PH people? Or did you guys come up with it on your own? >Matteru: We came up with it on our own >Tiffani: Ok thanks be sure to forward me any screenshots of bets that you guys might have.  So I believe that all 5 players were indeed involved in the planning of and the matchfixing itself.      ___ **VII - Jaren's Threats**    Following the release of the players' statement on Facebook yesterday evening Jaren sent them threats via FB chat and for some verbally - for more information you can read it up in the 2p article [here](http://bit.ly/ZMrYmT).  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/1orFyWv.jpg)'s his threat via Facebook message to Lance.  [Here](http://on.fb.me/1wlKvRt)'s Jaren's post on the Arrow Gaming Facebook Page once again in response to the statement alongside DDZ & Lance's [termination letter](http://i.imgur.com/ufw80Ut.jpg).  Jaren has also been threatening the players and their girlfriends in a [Facebook group chat](http://i.imgur.com/4dSaTIU.jpg) since this morning coercing them into supporting his version of the story and thus clearing his name.      ___ **VIII - Jaren Dota Talk & his Fake ""Official"" Facebook Pages for Dota 2 Teams**  You might be wondering why this section is included here - I feel the community & public deserves to know and it might also help in your understanding of Jaren and his influence in SEA.  I've been doing quite a lot of investigations on the series of fake ""Official"" Facebook pages of Dota 2 teams for a while now. The reason why I started to look into it was when I was travelling with the then-Titan Dota 2 squad at TI4 on the bus I saw that Jaren (there as Arrow's manager) was posting on the infamous ""[Fake iG page](http://on.fb.me/1tI0Va2)"" as one of the admins.  The fake pages are known for spreading questionable/false information to the Dota 2 community by acting like the organizations they impersonate: [1](http://i.imgur.com/w4HrqZX.png) [2](http://i.imgur.com/2U8q0Q1.png) [3](http://i.imgur.com/iOMiJ80.png) [4](http://i.imgur.com/qvtd2J2.png).   They often share pay-per-click ([1](http://i.imgur.com/baK6uo2.png [2](http://i.imgur.com/zbrdQ2z.png)) and ad links ([1](http://i.imgur.com/l6Rlbfe.png) [2](http://i.imgur.com/9OXw5b5.png) [3](http://i.imgur.com/dAizc50.png)) on their pages and blatantly [plagiarize contents](http://i.imgur.com/bfgBTw9.png) for that purpose.   Most of the pages in the same network have a large number of SEA followings ([1](http://i.imgur.com/1uupwR3.png [2](http://i.imgur.com/i3IJM3o.png)) so it is easy for the admins to spread and share information regardless of whether they are true or false within the SEA or greater Dota 2 community.  As I investigated further I realized that the pages were all similar & inter-linked in a way i.e. they would share the same contents/links and [share](http://i.imgur.com/9eJ226w.png) their own pages around and as a result it wasn't hard to get the entire list.   [Here](http://i.imgur.com/PP6EDJa.png) is the list of fake pages.    And here are some screenshots proving Jaren's involvement in them: [Proof 1](http://i.imgur.com/Cd45wT3.png) [Proof 2](http://i.imgur.com/RABbTo0.png) [Proof 3](http://i.imgur.com/c5ABdFJ.png).  These screenshots were obtained from their [open Facebook group](http://on.fb.me/1wsot1r) the ""Admins Centre"" which [controls this network of fake pages](http://i.imgur.com/nIITNuP.png).  With the large followings Jaren is able to use these pages to manipulate the community to an extent and him together with Nelson (owner and founder of the fake iG page) makes money from these [pay-per-click websites](http://i.imgur.com/d7nFYjf.png).  And following Ren's Reddit thread [this](http://i.imgur.com/FAe4ii2.png) was posted on the fake iG page. And this morning we see [this post](http://i.imgur.com/q7Kmxl5.png) that most likely came from Jaren who's one of the admins.     I definitely do not believe in impersonation plagiarism manipulation of information & also earning money off the community who follows your page thinking you're representing their favourite team. I have also told by reliable sources that giveaways held on his Dota Talk pages were mostly given to ghost accounts made by Jaren himself and he would sell the products from sponsors for money.  Earlier on I've also confirmed with Sharky that Jaren has not paid out the prize money for the AMD D2M League which was in March.       ___ **IX - Lastly...**     Here's a summary of my entire post:  * The 5 players themselves namely DDZ Lance Mozun Xiangzaii and Matteru planned and committed the crime of matchfixing. * The girlfriends Xiaoting and Hishiko were involved as accomplices in the matchfixing itself and later on as part of the team that worked on covering-up for the crime. * Jaren was part of or led the cover-up even though he denied his involvement initially. * Jaren owns and/or administrates a huge network of fake pages on Facebook and we know from there that Jaren will and can manipulate others around him to achieve his goals. His continuous involvement in those fake pages also suggests an openness to deceit and manipulation that brings his character into question.     So I think it is fair to say that for the Arrow ""322"" incident itself none of the involved parties are innocent. The tournament organizers and sponsors can decide what to do with the players. As for Jaren I'll leave it up to the community to decide what we should do with him.   I know by exposing Jaren & his fake pages it's equivalent to attaching a target on my forehead who knows if he might start throwing false claims or personal attacks my way. But despite all that I believe people deserve to know the truth. And the SEA scene will definitely be a much better place without people like Jaren the Arrow Gaming organization the fake pages and Dota Talk.         **Note**: I've also compiled a list of the real team pages for all SEA & Chinese teams with the help of Mali Staka & other SEA managers/captains and I will be posting a thread of the compilation on Reddit soon. Let's hope that despite the lack of help from Facebook such fake pages will not prevail.",article

Team CDEC: A Brief History,self.DotA2,"Hello everyone your resident bilingual DotA fan here this time bringing you an article on Team CDEC the dark horse of TI5 that has brought us many exciting games and pulling several unexpected upsets. CDEC entered TI5 as a relatively unknown team through the wildcard qualifiers having placed second to EHOME during the main qualifiers but have miraculously [cruised into the Grand Finals](/spoiler)  &nbsp;  CDECs performance in this International can only be described as astounding but it is quite unfortunate that the majority of the western populace know so little about this team  including the casters and analysts themselves. Ive taken the opportunity to do some additional research on the team and wrote this short article to help break down the language barrier that stifles the appreciation of talents and good DotA around the world.  &nbsp;  Source material credit goes to  [Carry6](http://www.carry6.com/dota2/zt/ti5zd/cdecg/) [TGBus](http://dota2.tgbus.com/news/industry/201508/13726612.shtml) [Sgamer](http://bbs.sgamer.com/forum-44-2.html)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  &nbsp;  **CDEC: A New Challenger**  &nbsp;  At its inception CDEC was an inhouse league started by LGD to spot new talent in the community. CDECs full name is **C**hina **D**ota **E**lite **C**ommunity  which is an inhouse league similar to IXDL in NAdota minus the trolling flaming ixmike and toxicity. From this league LGD selected five players to assemble into a junior practice team known as LGD.CDEC. After a couple of roster changes the team ultimately departed from its role as LGDs junior team setting out as an independent entity.   &nbsp;  In terms of team prowess CDEC is certainly not lacking in terms of skill  every one of its members are ladder-crowning pubstars in both DotA 1 and 2 (sitting at around 7200 mmr) whose skills are recognized amongst the Chinese community elite. However a team comprising of people born and molded from cancerous ranked games would naturally suffer from difficulties in teamwork and coordination.  &nbsp;  **Growth of a Team**  &nbsp;  CDECs progress into the dominating team it is now was not without its hiccups. A few months into its formation their core star player Maybe left CDEC for LGD in March 2015 a move (or ""promotion"") that did not come to much surprise given CDECs role as LGD's junior team as well as their mediocre competitive performance record. This resulted in a brief period of turmoil where CDEC had to find new players as well as shuffle existing roles.  &nbsp;  Their first strong performance was at G-League 2015 which took place in June 2015 where they placed 2nd losing to LGD 3-2 in the finals. They were noted for unique picks such as bounty hunter as well as scoring resounding 2-0 wins against Vici Gaming in the Dota 2 Champions League.  &nbsp;  The CDEC we see now has completely resolved those issues  were looking at a team that thinks acts and executes as a single cohesive unit. Each player knows their roles their priorities and pushes their hero synergies to the limit. In their games we see Agressif on the frontlines protected by the selfless supports Shikis solid midlane that helps his team transition smoothly into the midgame and Xzs offlane thats steadily improving with his initiations and clutch plays. While CDEC may not have the most mechanically skilled individuals the team is definitely no slouch against the Tier 1 teams on the international arena.  &nbsp;  **Road to TI5**  &nbsp;  Experience is often the bane of every newly forged team. CDEC sorely lacked experience facing against foreign teams having played exclusively within China thus far. To even enter the TI5 playoffs CDEC had to play against 2 western teams with completely different playstyles and meta approach to the game.   &nbsp;  How did CDEC overcome this obstacle? The solution was simple  play the CDEC style. By sticking to their trademark aggressive clashing they pushed their unique meta into their draft execution and game plan. For them it didnt matter if they won or lost a game the result would still be acceptable. This positive mentality is crucial for a new team and is a form of sportsmanship that should be valued and respected. It was with this iron confidence in their own playstyle that allowed CDEC to calmly advance through the group stages while making adjustments to ensure they stay ahead of the meta. This has allowed them to bring out their best no matter who the opponent is be it Empire with their notoriously strong teamfight prowess or the disciplined LGD with their calculated plays.   &nbsp;   **Player Tidbits:**  (credit to /u/arbipher /u/rozzerhmq /u/kaelmela and /u/LuluInDisguise for accuracy)  1: Agressif -   Joined CDEC at its inception and has been playing the carry position since. Used to be notoriously strong with blink-reliant carries such as Brewmaster and is known to 'start a rampage the moment he gets his blink dagger'. His Chinese moniker means Dominance.  &nbsp;  2: Shiki -   A pubstar known as the Ranked MMR King CDEC is Shikis second team and he is known to practice frequently with EHOME.Cty (which explains their similar playstyles). Cty Maybe and Shiki are rumored to be the three disciples of the legendary YaphetS. Both his English and Chinese moniker are a reference to an anime character ""Shiki Ryogi""  &nbsp;  3: Xz    Previously from  Team LaiG Xz used to be a mid player known for aggressive and flashy plays. After joining CDEC he initially had some trouble transitioning to the offlane role but is quickly adapting and meshing with the team. His Chinese moniker is ""Ash Ketchum"" from Pokemon.  &nbsp;  4: Garder  (  Another of CDECs founding members Garder has been one of the most consistent support players in the Chinese scene and was known for his stellar plays with Earthshaker. His Chinese moniker means ""I love Earthshaker""  &nbsp;  5: Q    Previously considered a poor support and CDECs weakest link Qs support skill has seen a marked improvement over the last few months quickly silencing past critics and establishing his ability to make clutch plays and maximize his impact in the game. His Chinese moniker means ""Gimme the ball Capt!""   &nbsp;  Hope the DotA community finds this helpful - I'll work on translating some of the Chinese players' interviews in the meantime!  P.S. Shoutout to kpii for doing Aussies proud!",article

Harmonic oscillations in stable spirit bear attack frequencies,self.DotA2,"The harmonic oscillations at which a unit engaged in a stable attack pattern performs discrete actions can be modeled to demonstrate counterintuitive increases to probabilistic event frequencies at inverse relationships to the waveform frequency due to the short term thresholds before any feasible scenario breaks down in real-world application. By relating the harmonic relationship of the two waveforms we can determine target attack speeds which are detrimental to exceed and the use of monte carlo models can provide an estimation of lost utility conferred from this extra attribute.  In this article we consider the case in which a Spirit Bear has at 4 skill points invested and has access to the skill Entangling Claws and then further examine the same case with addition of the item Skull Basher. By comparing the relative cooldowns of these procedurally invoked mechanics to attack frequencies given as a function of +% Attack Speed as a sum of item and skill effects weighted by the constant base attack time we can determine specific and optimal harmonic frequencies above which bash and/or entangle have less chance to proc.  A level 4 Spirit Bear has a base attack time of 1.45s. Attack Speed multipliers in the dota 2 engine are constrained to [-0.86] at [-80%+500%] respectively giving upper and lower bounds of Actions Per Second (hereafter ""APS"") of [7.250.24166]. In normal usage a Spirit Bear has +40% ASPD from Rabid combined with any item bonuses for a baseline of 1.0357 APS. Entangling Claws has a 20% event trigger chance on 5.00 cooldown and Skull Basher has a 25% event trigger chance on 2.3 cooldown. Cooldowns begin instantaneously upon event trigger and resolve before the exact engine tick upon which they would expire; a 5.00 cooldown started at 0.00 can trigger again at earliest at 5.00. Thus lower order harmonic frequencies of each trigger cooldown can be expressed as the discrete      Cooldown / N  EX. The 2.3 frequency of Skull Basher produces harmonics at N=1234 of [2.300 1.1500 0.7667 0.5750] APS respectively. We can then express the relationship of APS to ASPD as:      APS = 1.45 / (1 + ASPD)      ASPD = (1.45 - APS) / APS  Thus a 0.575 APS is given by 1.5217 ASPD or +152.17%  In this example we can see that resolving the discrete integer parameter of ASPD produces a definitive threshold from which the APS passes the harmonic. At +152% ASPD we have a 0.5754 APS. At +153% ASPD we have a 0.5731 APS. The meaningful loss of utility derives from the cooldowns of the Skull Basher being only slightly exceeded in frequency when stable scenarios of attack patterns in Dota do not exist for prolonged periods. At 0.5731 APS provided by +153% ASPD if the first attack occurs at 0.0000 the fourth attack will complete at 2.2925. If one attack triggers the mechanical event of Bash for Skull Basher without additional delay introduced to the system there must elapse four consequent attacks before the fifth one can now trigger it again. Yet with the lesser frequency of a 0.5754 APS provided by the +152% ASPD the fourth attack falls upon 2.3016. This fourth attack can trigger the event mechanic of Bash as it has occurred after the cooldown has elapsed. These two APS frequencies have only a relative difference of +/-0.4% for derived values such as Damage Per Second (hereafter ""DPS"") yet the difference in frequency of potential triggers has increased from 5 cycles of attacks at total 2.8656 APS to 4 cycles of attacks at total 2.3016 APS. This is an increase of +24.50% a relatively significant increase for a relatively insignificant drawback in other considerations like DPS. It is trivially assumed that as we are exceeding the threshold by only a minute value the point at which the faster frequency wraps around for an extra attack is not a reasonable concern for real-world applications.  [Figure 1: A table of Nth order harmonics for the basic cooldowns of 5.0 and 2.3 with corresponding APS and ASPD values.](http://i.imgur.com/L9n9rjm.png)  Slightly more involved is the triple harmonic of APS Bash Cooldown and Entangling Claws considered together. Under previous patches this cohered to a simple harmonic upon discrete 1.0 second intervals as Bash had a 2.0 cooldown reducing to an LCD of 1 and LCM of 10 but with the frequency of 2.3 cooldown this produces irregular intervals an LCM of 115. As such there exist no meaningful values at which harmonics occur within the ASPD constraints of [-0.85] to a significantly close degree.  Actual results are involved to model mathematically due to both the attachment of Bash and Entangling Claws mechanic triggers to random chance as well as the modification of trigger chances by pseudorandom distribution for Skull Basher's Bash ability- an attribute not shared by Entangling Claws. To detail estimated utility of given APS vs relative triggers a Monte Carlo simulation run over a large number of interations provides an accurate model of the drop in trigger frequency associated with exceeding harmonic resonances.  [Figure 2. Monte Carlo simulation of Bash and Entangling Claws independent event occurrences in 20.00 seconds of continuous attacking](http://i.imgur.com/1hn9jWB.png)  [Figure 3. Simulation of 200.00 second trials.](http://i.imgur.com/lT54lsx.png)  Calculations based upon static frequencies for given APS are contingent upon continuous attacking against an immobile target or one requiring no additional movement beyond the actionable portion of attack frequency of a Spirit Bear be it post-backswing or animation canceling. In real-world scenarios this system is unstable and quickly collapses due to external factors be it repositioning or disables or implicit constraints such as a bashed target becoming deceased. To some degree these scenarios may appear contrived but hedging against this is the self-stabilizing application of Bash / Entangling Claws as immobilizing targets in turn granting continuous ability to full frequency of attacks. To what degree this can occur in any application is not quantifiable but holds significant potential for optimization.",article
An analysis of GMOs in DotA2: are players cautious of picking a genetically modified hero?,self.DotA2,**TL:DR:Obviously gnetically modified heroes are picked less often than their counterparts and perform slightly worse overall.**  Public perception is an important driver of consumer choices.  Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are a timely and relevant example of this phenomenon.  There is a growing sentiment among shoppers to prefer all-natural foods while products that are processed filled with hard-to-pronounce chemicals or are genetically modified are met with hesitation.  It is possible that this trend is not limited to food choices and therefore I pose the question: **do DotA2 players avoid picking obviously genetically modified heroes?**  To begin to address this further explanation of GMOs is required.  In the most basic sense of the term a GMO is any organism which has had its genetic material altered.  Im not sure exactly how this process occurs but it is clear from many [examples](http://i.imgur.com/8dJxsB4.png) that it [involves](http://i.imgur.com/LCWn06x.png) the [injection](http://i.imgur.com/V02vUSp.png) of ([usually](http://i.imgur.com/b5uWsae.png)) bright [colored](http://i.imgur.com/vnpDK6O.png) [liquids](http://i.imgur.com/ovf56bt.png) directly into [fruits](http://i.imgur.com/7jtUH1R.png) via an [over-sized](http://i.imgur.com/RuI6jcB.png) syringe which can result in an [evil hybrid](http://i.imgur.com/O0huAv9.png).  For further explanation I spoke to an expert at my college a professor of Theological Biology.  They offered this concise explanation: You can think of a GMO as really any living thing that has had its DNA base pairs (or A T C and Gesus) changed in a way that changes its Intended Path.  Asked if syringes with colorful liquids are commonly used for this More often than not.  It is worth mentioning that there are varying degrees to which organisms are modified.  One method to which the public is particularly wary involves inserting another species DNA into the genome of another.  For example tomatoes and strawberries have been injected with fish genes to protect them from freezing!  I know what youre thinkingsounds gross!  Who would want a fishy strawberry?  From my understanding the taste isnt altered and only the added benefit of temperature resistance is conferred.  This raises another relevant question to DotA2: **are genetically modified heroes at any advantage over non-GMO heroes?**  To set out answering the above two questions we first need a list of GMO heroes.  For this analysis I am choosing to focus on heroes that obviously contain genetic material from two species the type of GMO the public is most concerned over.  To this end I chose to exclude any uncertainties such as: anthropomorphic heroes (Ursa Earthshaker Tiny etc.) demons or ghosts (such as Bane) and separate races (Ogres the Skywrath Slithereen etc.).  I have compiled a list of potential GMO (clearly two species) heroes below:    Hero| Species Combination| Can naturally breed?| Two species GMO?|  ---|---|----|----|---- Centaur Warrunner| Human and horse|X| | text Dragon Knight| Human and dragon| X| | text Enchantress| Human and deer| X| | text Leshrac| Human and goat| X| | text Lone Druid| Human and bear| X| | text Lycan| Human and wolf| X| | text Magnus| Mammoth and ~~giant~~ Rhinoceros | Unlikely|  (tentative)| text   With an established list of likely two species GMO heroes data for matches played and won were collected from dotabuff.com.  The comparisons seen in the table below were made between our group of seven GMO heroes and all the rest. Additionally a second all other heroes group was tested that got rid of high picked outlier heroes Pudge Sniper and Phantom Assassin.       Table 2| GMO Heroes| All other heroes| All other heroes minus outliers ---|---|----|---- **Total number of heroes**| 7| 103| 100 **Total number of times played**| 346421468| 8459488034| 7772529509 **Average number of times played**| 49488781| 82130952   (39.70% higher)| 77725295 (36.32% higher)  **Number of matches won**| 167839103| 4184156016| 3847723338  **Average win rate**| 48.45%| 49.46%| 49.50%  **From the above results I conclude the significantly lower pick rate of GMO heroes is a result of players hesitant attitudes towards genetically-meddled two species abominations.**  While the pick rates mirror public perceptions of food-related GMOs there does not appear to be an advantage for GMO heroes in terms of win rate.  In fact GMO heroes win games at a rate one percent lower than other heroes suggesting that their modifications were either faultily done or were not specifically used to better the hero in question but rather produce an unnatural being to satisfy a twisted curiosity.  In conclusion this pilot study offers the first reported evidence of genetically modified heroes in DotA2 and shows that players are hesitant to pick these engineered two species hybrids.  **Further classification and study is needed for other heroes excluded from these analyses to establish additional lines of evidence and to explore this pattern in more detail.**  The ideas presented here are not absolute; I welcome others opinions and thoughts about this sensitive political topic.

The Glimpse - A Look Back on this Week in Dota 2 - January Week 2,self.DotA2,"Hey Now everybody! Welcome to The Glimpse a new weekly /r/dota2 series in which I attempt to sum up for you all of the best that our subreddit had to offer this week. I get it not everyone has time to sit underneath the glorious faucet of /new and wait to [](/flair-techies). That's cool here's what you might have missed this week.    So how are we going to do this? This is the beta for Glimpse. Currently I am compiling this list by pulling top scoring links daily and sorting them by how they are tagged. Because of this someone can look at just Dota content or jut eSports posts. To dig a little deeper we are also going to be sorting underneath our two umbrellas by organizing the posts by tags. In addition to the links to the original posts I will give my best editorial of what's going on.    Some things to keep in mind: This is a proof of concept and a beta. This project is open to change to your feedback so feel free to talk about what you would like to see done or done differently.

Entity Gaming's Manager statement about Ar1se,self.DotA2,From the manager from the other thread:  Arise situation summary. What he is going around telling is partly true but not the entire story. I will try to explain in short as possible. Player A=A tier 1 famous player  Original Lineup is supposed to be Arise Noia Hestje Job Player A  Arise says he cannot play with player A. And the rest of the team feels arise is a better fit for the team. Player A is told he doesn't have a spot in the team anymore. And luk is recruited.  A week later everyone except Ar1se reach the bootcamp. Arise is supposed to reach a week later.  Suddenly panic sets in. Can I make it in SEA? Its so stacked now. Even Forevs new team is in SEA now. My brain tells me yes but my gut tells me no.  We speak on call for an hour. I convince him to take the leap of faith. He says yes.  Next few days all messages from me and the teammates are ignored while selfies are uploaded on facebook.  Finally he confirms on Thursday he is ready to fly on Tuesday i.e today. I ask for his passport copy and next day hes missing again.  Teammates say fuck it. Hes in 2 minds again and his mood swings are too much. Lets ask player A again if he is available. Player A is still available and ready to play with us.  Saturday Arise is ready to fly again. I ask the teammates they say yes lets fly arise now. We say no to player A once and for all.  I ask him multiple times if he is 100% ready to come and he keeps saying yes. He says he is ready to give it his all and ready to move.  Due to it being the weekend I cant book the ticket as travel agent is closed.  Player A all this while is still not locked to any team and a free agent.  Sunday 8 pm IST player A's new team is announced and he is officially locked.  Sunday 9pm IST arise tells us he cant fly because he has 'family issues' and that he is demoralized.  20 mins later he messages me saying he is ready to fly again where I tell him I cannot risk his mood swings again waste any more time and officially remove him from the roster.  I have been very considerate in giving statements like unforeseeable circumstances and personal reasons because I dont like mud slinging but since we are being portrayed as the bad people who forced the young boy to fly to SEA I figured some clarity was necessary.  Tl dr: Ar1se confirmed to move to SEA then changed decisions multiple times making Entity Gaming to lose a tier 1 member to other team then denied to go to SEA. The manager is so pissed of the mood swing he removed him from squad when Ar1se messaged again.,article

9 Patch 6.84 Changes if r/Dota2 Was IceFrog,esportsexpress.com,,article
Lycan senpai pls notice me ;_;,fruitscs.tumblr.com,,article
A Brief History of Invoker,self.DotA2,"Thought I'd give a brief history of Invoker.   &nbsp;  I first played DotA in version 5.36 and have played it pretty much continuously from version 6.06. Ever since invoker was added removed and then re-added later he has been my favourite and main hero - I've probably accrued 3000+ games with him by now.   I wanted to give a history of Invoker as I have a few unique insights things I didnt want lost to the mists of time.   &nbsp;  A little known fact is that although Invoker was released in version 6.10 when Icefrog was running the show he was actually a product of the Guinsoo era and was already partially in the game files with the final touches happening in the hazy interim period between Guinsoo Neichus and IceFrog.   The basic idea and format for the Invoker was created by a map maker known as Bug. The hero's genesis comes largely in part from another custom map for Warcraft 3 called 'Spellcraft'. Players would collect various reagents as items and combine them in different combinations to make spells they could then use. It was not uncommon for Guinsoo to 'borrow' hero ideas from other DotA like games - the game we play was after all originally called 'Dota All-stars' borrowing the best heroes from other games. But it would take the talents of IceFrog to actually bring the hero into the game.   &nbsp;  In version 6.10 Invoker was finally released in a playable form. Strangely he started his life as a Radiant hero (called Sentinel back then) before being later shifted to Dire (called Scourge). The normal mode of the game back then limited you to only playing Sentinel or Scourge so an effort was made to keep the two teams relatively balanced - although in practice most everyone played Allpick making it a moot point.  The main difference between the old Invoker and the new was that the order in which the reagents of Quas Wex and Exort were invoked mattered - QQW would invoke a different spell to QWQ for example. This gave him a total of 27 different spells. Invoke as an ability only had one level and was gotten at level 6 (with only one spell slot on a 12s CD) and the effect of Quas and Exort were swapped - Quas gave a percentage damage boost and Exort gave HP regen. There were other small differences as well but these were the main ones.  [Here](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Invoker/Old) is a listing of the old abilities.  &nbsp;  Contrary to popular belief Invoker wasnt some super imbalanced powerhouse in his old incarnation. In my opinion the modern Invoker is much more powerful and flexible. An example is the regen provided by the old Exort compared to the modern Quas - it used to max out at 7.2 hp/s but now its max is 21 hp/s. There has been tremendous power creep since then but fundamentally because he could only combo two spells every 12 seconds it really limited the total damage output he had. Likewise his old spells didnt have the synergy the modern ones do (such as the Tornado Meteor Blast combo).   Yet at the same time certain spells were definitely overpowered or buggy on release. Chaos Meteor's damage was twice as powerful as it should have been and Shroud of Flames (a spell similar to Ember Spirits Flame Guard) would damage towers. I think these early buggy and not-yet-balanced spells are what people have in mind when they recall Invoker being the epitome of imbalance. From my experience heroes such as Spirit Breaker on release (in 6.08) were much more powerful.   In any case while he did have some overly powerful spells versions 6.11 to 6.16 saw a series of balance changes that brought him largely in line with the other heroes and by then he was relatively well balanced. But despite these balance changes because he could only have one spell invoked at a time with a 12s CD to switch them out players would often rely on one or two spells and only spam those - especially if those spells had a cooldown less than Invoke itself. This would remain a fundamental flaw in the hero design.   &nbsp;  What was Invoker like playing then? Fun and uniquely rewarding. I had a list of all 27 spells taped to the side of my monitor and even to this day recall many of the more important ones such as Owl Scout being WEQ - long since burnt into muscle memory. And although he had access to 27 spells many of them were outclassed by others and so only 15 or so were important all of the time. Spells such as Firestorm or Chaos Meteor were always better than Inferno - when you can only cast one spell every 12s you would cast the best. However I always admired Invokers that knew to bring up Soul Blast to heal themselves (nuke and heal in one) or Soul Reaver to chase (nuke and speed boost in one).   One other peculiarity of this era was that Invoker was soon shifted into his own separate tavern away from the other heroes (in the old maps there were six or so 'taverns' housing the heroes - the player would select the tavern then spawn their hero from the tavern). This special tavern had to be activated with a command from the player who hosted the game. Incidentally techies was also in this tavern for a while as was the old silencer after he was remade (the one with starfall and summon infernal).   &nbsp;   When 6.17 was released Invoker was removed from the game. While it was partially because of his 27 spell design it was also largely due to core-functionality bugs brought on by the WC3 engine that Icefrog was still struggling with. One key bug was that spamming Wex would cause spell projectiles to miss (such as Naga Siren's Net). Likewise simply changing orbs would interrupt actions something not remedied until years later. I think the inability to easily iron out the bugs was as much a factor in his removal as the need for a rework - this was seen earlier with heroes such as Bloodseeker being removed temporarily because of bugs brought on by engine limitations.   I and many others put forward ideas and suggestions for how the hero could be improved in the interim. The most common suggestion was to make it so the order of reagents invoked didnt matter bringing his spell total from 27 down to a much more manageable 10. Some of his older spells would be recombined into the new ones whilst others were simply dropped. Incidentally quite a few of his spells would be re-purposed for other heroes such as Betrayal becoming Winter Wyverns ultimate and the aforementioned Flame Guard.   &nbsp;  In 6.49 Invoker returned as a 'secret boss'. Several of the 6.x9 versions had special summonable enemies that would take a team to battle against a bit like what is seen with Wraith Night Year Beast etc. In this case Invoker was a powerful enemy that spammed spells and could be fought in the Roshan pit.  In 6.50 Invoker made his return as a playable hero. He has remained largely unchanged since then except for the spells Alacrity and EMP being swapped around (WWW to WWE and vice versa). Alacrity only used to boost attack rate and EMP removed mana based on Wex and did damage based on Exort (a combination of the old EMP and Energy Ball spells). He was also given an Aghanim's Sceptre upgrade.  Invoker's model was based on Kael'thas Sunstrider leader of the Blood Elves from which he had the name Kael. He also had the fun name Kal-El Superman's true name. When a leaked Chinese change log for patch 6.72 arrived on the internet it was hurriedly put through Google translate to get a rough English version which mistakenly translated  his name as ""Carl"". The humorous name caught onbut when IceFrog joked ""Carl had it coming"" in reference to the numerous nerfs Invoker received this alternate name was all but cemented.   &nbsp;  What's in the future for Invoker? Who knows. I personally feel he could use a new Aghanims effect that actually boosts the power of his spells and not just reduces the cooldown of Invoke. A simple solution would be each reagent is considered one level higher. Quas level 7 would be considered level 8 and create an icewall that slows for 160% and lasts for 13.5s (instead of 140% and 12s).   Invoker is a unique and rewarding hero to master and a signature of the great game of DotA itself.   Hope you enjoyed.  ",article

Every OG.Ana mid matchup during Kiev Majors,self.DotA2,This is a repost since the post was removed and then put back on but with no text...  Ana at the time of the kiev majors had the highest world mmr. Close to 9.4k mmr. Even then there doesn't seem to be nearly as much hype on him if we compare him to rtz miracle or midone.   I've looked into some data. First I want to see the priority that OG gives for ana's hero in their drafts and compare the numbers with the other top 4 teams. All the data below was manually taken from [dotabuff](https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/leagues/5157).  [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nAbdMAa1ooHTv-_gpPkOOU0UvET1kK0crtb-3ejEKnI/edit?usp=sharing)  **Pick Priority**   My first impression before looking at this data was that OG didn't really last picked ana's hero too often but looking at it we can see that while OG is not the team that gives the most priority to its mid player  they are very close in terms of 4th/5th picking ana a hero.  **Relationship between pick order and winrate**  This sample size is rather small and my non-statistics brain feels like the better way to decide whether there's any relationship between ana recieving the last pick and OG winning would be to analyze more games. That wouldn't be enough either since there are a lot of variables that are not being considered: different drafts different teams players could be playing something they are not familiar/don't like.  Even then: Ana has a huge winrate discrepancy when he gets his hero picked as the last one. He had **81% winrate** in this case **33% when he got 4th pick** and **50% with 3rd pick**.  **How good are the matchups OG gives to ana ?**  To answer this question I decided to ask a 6.7 k player that is in the NA leaderbords(Dark Raider [twitter](https://twitter.com/DarkraiderDota) his opinnion on every draft that og played. Waga voluntereed to help but since it took some time for him to see my message I ended up forced to write this since I'm going to travel for 3 days. There will be a video version of this so I'll probably add his opinions there. The questions the  mid player needed to answer for every draft was: Define Ana's matchup in the midlane in terms of favourable not favourable even or arguable and do you think ana's hero fit's the draft ? (Not only has synergy with his team but is ok against the enemies draft.)  **Disclaimer** The guy was super nice humble and helped me all the way in this part of the text. He just wanted everyone to know that he doesn't feel nearly as good as the OG players and when he answers whether he feels like x hero fits the lineup he is giving his input that he feels is definitely inferor to OG's but obviously relevant for most people reading this.  ---  **SG SERIES**  ---  [game 1](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3137046741)  **Ana's Arc Warden vs Puck**  Favourable ? **No**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **No**  Result: **Loss **  Player note: **Puck favored// phase shift great for dodging spark wraiths// illusory orb means puck never dies solo and has greater kill potential I would not last pick arc warden into a puck. As you can see sg last picked it as I assume they also believed it to be a strong matchup**  ---  [game 2](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3137147095)  **Ana's OD vs Ember**  Favourable ? **Yes**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**  Result: **Win**  Player note: **Def OD favored specifically vs ember but od pretty much solid matchup most of the time mid I would last pick this hero. Also great in that game vs morph and counter to lc duel**  ---   [game 3](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3137225459)  **Ana's DK vs Invoker**  Favourable ? **No**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**  Result: **Win**  Player note: **Should be invoker favored but living armour balances it out a bit more The dk pick seems to be more overall draft focused than lane focused OG wanted to push and needs a front line tanky hero**  ---  **IG SERIES**  ---  [game 1](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3137643518)  **Ana's Invoker vs TA**  Favourable ? **No**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **No**  Result: **Loss**  Player note: **Hugely ta favored one of the most favored matchups for mid currently Invoker can't do much to refraction at early levels and most ta's by lvl six get a blight stone and low armor invokers get forced out of lane or die**  ---  [game 2](https://t.co/7M3SxtSc68)  **Ana's DK vs Storm**  Favourable ? **Even**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**  Result: **Loss**  Player note: **Even matchup hard to kill dk as storm alone but breathe fire and static remnant help both cs well Range matchup vs melee mid always favors range a little more but only slightly**  ---  **RANDOM SERIES**  ---  [game 1](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3138972122)  **Ana's TA vs Medusa**  Favourable ? **Yes**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**  Result: **Win**  Player note: **Looks like Medusa was mid but shadow played him and he is usually their carry player so that might just be a comfort draft for random. That said ta has an advantage// Medusa can burn mana but not deal damage with refraction up mostly they trade farm I'd pick ta against Medusa and in this game**  ---  [game 2](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3139052266)  **Ana's SF vs Lina**  Favourable ? **NO**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **?**  Result: **Loss**  Player note: **Its always about souls for sf with a mk helping lina it should be Lina favored for a long time Lina has a lot of kill potential on sf once sf gets levels though he can double raze waves and go jungle So while Lina favored sf shouldn't be too threatened and can catchup fast**  ---  [game 3](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3139141584)  **Ana's Invoker vs Troll**  Favourable ? **Yes**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**  Result: **Win**  Player note: **invoker rounds out OGs lineup well in this game ss axe call is always good and they have a naga so want have 4 other heroes to do things while naga farms**  ---  **THUNDERBIRD SERIES**  ---  [game 1](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3139522868)  **Ana's DK vs Lina**  Favourable ? **NO**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**  Result: **LOSS**  Player note: **Really good matchup for lina And with a BH on her team should be a dominant mid lane This def looks like a dk pick to help with their lineup this is the 2nd time they picked it with arc warden I believe so might be a draft they like He has a mk on his side but BH cancels it out I personally wouldn't pick dk into lina but seems like OG had a draft in mind I don't want to seem like I know better than OG or anything like that lol just my opinions**  ---  [game 2](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3139652866)  **Ana's ember vs Lina**  Favourable ? **NO**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**  Result: **Win**  Player note: **Lina favored can take off flameguard pretty easily but they have tree armor again to help ember Main focus is on alch for OG tho so I can see ember being good for their lineup I'd pick it for a good lineup but not to win the lane vs lina when ember is 6 he can kill lina tho**  ---   [game 3](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3139768515)  **Ana's Alch vs Meepo**  Favourable ? **Even**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**  Result: **Win**  Player note: **Its an alch not really much for laning with that hero Meepo can kill alch if he lanes but I think they both jungle to get extra farm after pushing out a wave mid Usually supports come in and take lvls OG love alch so they know when to pick it I'd pick it if its good for the game/draft**  ---  **RANDOM SERIES [2]**  ---  [game 1](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3144437316)  **Ana's Timbersaw vs Alchemist**  Favourable ? **Yes**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**  Result: **LOSS**  Player note: **Oh this they went for a lane win for sure timber advantage over alch// Timber forces alch to jungle really early// mk can mess with jungle a bit and then timber can go pressure other lanes make space for spectre**  ---  [game 2](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3144607791)  **Ana's ember vs DP**  Favourable ? **NO**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**  Result: **LOSS**  Player note: **Strong dp lane //has a silence later on but siphon soul hard to get rid of flameguard tho Looks like a decent ember lineup for OG idk much about arc warden OG seemed to like it but they seemed to lose with it a decent amount I'd pick ember for the game not so much for mid matchup but its not bad**  ---   [game 3](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3144797892)  **Ana's Ember vs Lina**  Favourable ? **NO**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**  Result: **Win**  Player note: **Very similar to that other game we saw// Ember not great vs lina but has tree armour and they have an alch so more focused on him I'd pick ember for the game but no the mid matchup**  ---  **FACELESS SERIES**  ---  [game 1](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3146474108)  **Ana's OD vs Morphling**  Favourable ?

**Arguable**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**  Result: **LOSS**  Player note: **Again Ursa mid which really fits VP style so I see why they pick it but ta can survive with refraction and mk helping again I'd pick ta vs ursa But looks like VP had a better overall draft this game**  ---   [game 3](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3149353238)  **Ana's Storm vs DK**  Favourable ? **Even**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **NO**  Result: **LOSS**  Player note: **Already talked about dk vs storm Overall tho dk fits better into lineup Mag with storm dusa cores not much synergy Weird storm pick wouldn't really pick it Gives them initiation tho so maybe they liked it for that**  ---   [game 4](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3149480550)  **Ana's Ember vs Silencer**  Favourable ? **NO**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**  Result: **WIN**  Player note: **Silencer good laner vs ember usually comes out ahead// Very even drafts too //both mids fit well into their respective teams// I'd pick ember for the game not to win mid tho**  ---  [game 5](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3148721353)  **Ana's Troll vs OD**  Favourable ? **NO**  Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Arguable**  Result: **WIN**  Player note: **Really good matchup for OD as we saw OG went down early but outplayed VP got back into the game and troll carried them So no I wouldn't pick troll into od but that's why I'm me and OG are major winners they know what it takes to win**  ---  I know there are issues with me analyzing this data I'll list some of them here:  * The data is opinion based and can vary  * There is not enough data (but as you can see manualy gathering and analyzing this is not easy at all)  * I'm not comparing how other teams match up their mid players  That being said though I feel like the compiled list on its own is pretty cool and I want to at least sort the results I get and see what can come out of it.   If you go back to the table i gave right in the begining you're going to note some very important things.   * **41% of times OG gave Ana a matchup that is not optimal** * **While 29% of times the matchup was considered good or very good. The other 29% of games are even matchups or games where roamers or other heroes could mess with how the lane would go.**  On top of that one stat I want to highlight is that Ana only lost one game where the matchup was considered good for him while he won a lot of games that he was given a bad lane. Of course since OG won they are going to have a high wr regardless but if you look at the table from the 24 games 9 were considered bad matchups and he won 5 of those games. Meaning his winrate against bad matchups is not too far away from OG's overall winrate in the tournament.   * **Winrate against bad matchups: 55%** * **Winrate against good matchups: 85%** * **OG's tournament winrate: 62%**  A lot of the Analysts in the desk were saying that Ana is one type of player that can comeback into the game way better than other mid players like midone/noOne/Miracle. I'm not sure this data really supports that even though it definitely felt like that watching the major.   I'll also analyze how much resources OG spends trying to help mid when you compare it to EG/VP/IG . I feel like this is one very important stat that i just couldn't obtain without watching the games so i feel like a video version is better for that. I don't want to draw any bold statements here so my humble conclusions are:  * Contrary to popular belief OG does give Ana priority in the draft. When you compare the number of 4th and 5th mid picks for OG they are only behind VP (but not so far away from other teams)  * It does feel like OG is more focused in the overal game plan than their lanes (not necessarily only mid). The fact that Ana has had more bad matchups than good ones can testify to that and considering OG won the major it feels like  OG are very good at playing around a mid player that won't have so much impact in the mid game.   * I wanted to add an analysys on whether OG last pick Ana's heroes focusing on mid matchup or game plan. Unfortunately this took longer to write than i expected and i don't have the pick data in the google spreadsheet. Sorry about that but i'll try to include it in the video Regardless of Ana being good at playing from behind you can't really deny that when he gets a good lane matchup he is a decisive force in OG winning. (55% wr with bad matchup and 85% when he has a good one)  ,article

An analysis of Luna's win rate: does the visible portion of the moon in the night sky affect hero success?,self.DotA2,"Heroes based on certain themes are commonplace in DotA2; one need not look far to recognize the in-your-face connection between ""Lycan"" and a man who transforms into a wolf. Similarly there is Luna a woman whose name literally translates to ""moon"" and whose responses and abilities are dominated by references to that celestial body. While some heroes' themes are limited to fantasy the moon is a staple in our own lives.  Indeed the moon has real world implications from tides to animal behavior and even acting as the basis for calendar months.  Some even go so far as to suggest the moon's influences on the menses.    That being said the relationship between the moon and its influence on the innate subconscious abilities of video game players remains poorly defined.  Therefore in this seminal preliminary study I sought to determine if players seemingly respond to the phase of the moon in an instinctual manner as measured by improved win-rate outcomes for a largely moon based hero.  To this end I compared the visible portion of the moon in the night sky to the average win rate of Luna to determine if there was any correlation between the two. **I hypothesize as the visible portion of the moon increases Luna's win rate will exhibit a slight rise which will fall again as the phase shifts to ""new moon""**.  To orient readers with the basis of this study I have compiled relevant information into [Figure 1 as seen here](http://imgur.com/a/gP0Gc).  Figure 1C displays the names and pictorial representation of the phases of the moon in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Note while the orientation of the moon may differ between the two hemispheres the visible percentage of the moon remains the same.  The phases of the moon in the past two weeks of May 2017 are highlighted in Figure 1A and Figure 1B shows Luna's win rate over this same period in time. From Figures 1A and 1B it is plainly evident that Luna's win rate went under a substantial increase from May 3 (first or half moon) to May 10 (full moon).  Granted there are minor fluctuations during this period but the overall increase is the important takeaway.  Some of you may be saying ""so what?""  Rightly so this was just one example.  This is why in Figure 2 I plotted the visible portion of the moon against Luna's win rate over a one year period.  [As seen here](http://imgur.com/a/aUwWL) the visible portion of the moon (in blue) follows a sinusoidal function varying from 0 to 100%.  Luna's win rate is plotted in red and can be seen fluctuating generally between 50-55%. When zooming in on the chart the pattern between Luna's win rate and the moon's phases becomes clear.  **Generally as the moon reaches peak visibility Luna's win rate peaks.  Indeed as the moon waxes Luna's mercy appears to wane.  Conversely as the moon loses visibility Luna's win rate will fall.**  This pattern is not exhibited in 100% of the peaks and valleys of the moon's visibility as there are expected fluctuations based on balance changes to the hero and random chance but in general the above described correlation seems to happen more often than due to random probability alone.    To further demonstrate this correlation between Luna's win rate and the visible portion of the moon I compared the average percent change in win rate during the transitions between each of the moon's phases over the same year.  [As seen in Figure 3](http://imgur.com/a/AS9Np) there is a striking positive change in Luna's win percentage as the moon wanes and a corresponding negative change as the moon waxes.  **Taken together these data strongly suggest the visible portion of the moon affects Luna's win rate.**  I therefore propose a new chart-based system to determine when players should or should not prioritize playing Luna based on the phases of the moon which includes my newly minted ""Phases of Luna"" as seen below:      Moon Phase|  Should I play Luna?| Phases of Luna ----|----|---- New|  No| Newbs Only Waxing Crescent|  If you're feeling lucky| Waxing Luna First Quarter|  Flip a coin| Coin Flip Waxing Gibbous|  Probably okay| Increasingly Waxing Luna Full|  Yes| Full Win Potential Waning Gibbous|  Worth a shot| Waning Luna Last Quarter|  Flip a coin| Coin Flip Two Waning Crescent|  Can't reccommend| Increasingly Waning Luna  Granted there are limitations to this study such as the cloud cover and its effect on the overall visibility of the moon regardless of the phase. Also the data presented here do not shed insight into what mechanism explains the observed correlation.  It remains unclear whether the moon itself is having an effect or simply the players' awareness of the moon. Further studies should also address whether or not Tidehunter might also be affected in a similar manner.  Thank you for reading and I look forward to your comments.   ",article

Happy 322. Today we take a moment to recognize the match-fixing issue in eSports.,self.DotA2,322\. It's hard to find a more infamous number in Dota. You would be dreaming to think of a danker Dota meme.  While we sit in a circle high atop our tower of upvotes furiously jerking over these three very important numbers it's hard to take a step back and realize just how serious they actually are.     For those who are uninitiated 322 is more than just a joke. Maybe you don't play Dota and have only ever known 322 as a highway or  23x14. Maybe you have seen it typed in your pub games when Io builds a shadow blade. Maybe you've seen it in passing in discussions. Regardless 322 might be big in the well informed Dota communities but it's impact in the wider eSports scene feels small. Today on March 22^nd we aim to change that.   So what is 322? 322 is slang for a Dota match-fixing. Match-fixing is the process of playing a match in an organized sport in which the outcome is pre-determined. In June of 2013 during Star Ladder Season 6 just that happened. RoX.KIS Dota 2 squad was playing a group stage match vs zRAGE. The match was insignificant in regards to standings as both teams were out of the tournament at this point. Solo RoX's captain placed a $100 bet against his team in this match.  A match that they were heavily favored to win.   It was a shock when zRAGE won the match; as many people betting in game items factious funny money and real currency lost the safe bet.  Upset happen in sports often times that's the fun of betting in the first place. However when Solo was found to have placed a bet against his own team everything changed. Controversy ran rapid through the Dota scene. Reputations were tarnished player integrity ruined and skeptics born. Solo received a lifetime ban from Star Ladder. His team and organization were also punished to a lesser extent. All of this fuss and what did Solo get out of it? **$322.** A meme is born.   Match-fixing isn't a new conundrum in the world of eSports. You're most likely familiar with this term because of it's traditional sports shenanigans. Could you imagine Kobe rolling on into the sports book and dropping a stack against the Lakers? No? That's right because player's simply cant bet against your own team in professional sports. It's against the rules and in many cases just strait illegal. Maybe you've heard about the 1919 world series? Or Tim Donaghy? Or the Italian Football Scandal?   In addition to existing offline match-fixing has plagued a myriad of other prestigious eSports titles. Broodwar was rocked in 2010 when the Korean news confirmed Match Fixing going on in Starcraft. KeSPA banned 11 professional players who received massive fines once they were confirmed to have bet against themselves. In addition gaming was these players documented professions in Korea these illegal acts were punishable by law. since The loyal Broodwar community felt quite betrayed.  Counter Strike community has run rampant with allegations and confirmed match fixing reports already in 2015. Back in January iBUYPOWER caused quite the mess when they were found to have thrown a match against NetCodeGuides. Mind you that at this point in time the iBuy team was playing and representing as a premiere American team. After heavy bets were placed by a group of people with insider information the clowny match and subsequent loss was just the tip of the iceberg. Ultimately Valve the game's developer levied lifetime suspensions on those involved. Not a month later in February Valve had to dish out additional bans in the process setting a firm precedent on what happens when you bet on games when you're a pro.   League of Legends has not stopped itself from cutting a nice ol' hunk of drama pie for itself either. Last year Ahq e-Sports Club was confirmed to be fixing matches. Their team manager was tricking one of their players into throwing games which was fueling his eSports gambling addiction in attempt to make back the team's salary money which he lost prior. This story is more notable as the player who was aiding in fixing the matches was so distraught he attempted to hill himself by leaping off a twelve story building.   Again we find outselves back in Dota 2 where the match fixing did not stop with Solo.  Arrow Gaming namely it's players DDZ and Lance were ousted after rumors were posted to reddit that they were involved with betting and match fixing incidents which were plaguing the SEA region. After much work and many lies were spit to attempt to cover tracks the two players admitted to match fixing.   But what ever happened to Solo? His ban was lifted after a year. He continues to play on professional Dota 2 teams to this day.   322 is more than a meme. It embodies an entire controversy. Match-fixing is real. Gambling problems are serious. There are professional players in every major eSport that have dabbled in or considered the abominable behavior. Fixing matches has the ability to undermine so much in an industry we are working so hard to grow. It's becoming more than just a game and criminals need to be treated to the highest of standards. We can not be tolerant of short term player bans or new teams containing known offenders.  Valve with their firm hand in a step in the right direction regarding Counter Strike in 2015.  Happy 322 to you. Let us look forward to the amazing year of competition ahead and the continued growth of a joy we all share. ,article

How Far We've Come - An analysis of the meta over the years.,self.DotA2,As the smoke settles on Key Arenas stage (quite literally thanks to the pyrotechnics) we the spectators are left to pick apart the complex meta that to the tune of which $11 million has been won. One of the greatest things about Dota 2 is the multitude of strategies that can all lead to success; in the words of ~~n0tail~~ BigDaddy everything can work. These meta shifts can be seen clearly when examining past Internationals with each tournament possessing its own style of play.   &nbsp;  ###The International 2011 - TI1  In the first International all eyes were fixated on the teams carries. Antimage and Spectre battled to be the most sought after hero with Weaver and Sven being picked up in the event that the former heroes were already banned. In this meta killing the enemys carry was massive and having your own carry be killed  devastating. Many matches would be determined simply by the amount of gold in your carrys pocket and as such space-creating supports were in high demand. Vengeful Spirit and Earthshaker meant that any potential threat to your carry could be neutralized with a well-aimed stun and an offlane Beastmaster provided mobile vision in an effort to prevent ganks. Chen also sat on the top of teams shopping lists a trend we would continue to see for the next two Internationals thanks to his versatility. In a meta as carry-centric as this I personally find it a shame that BurNing would not be seen on the big stage until the following year and with the next International comes the next metagame.  &nbsp;  ###The International 2012 - TI2  It is in this International that we saw arguably the most radical meta shift. Gone was the strong focus on protecting the carry and its place lain a strong emphasis on pushing. After all in what other meta could Leshrac and Venomancer be considered top picks? Even Broodmother got to stretch her legs on the battlefield on a fairly consistent basis. Teams looked for early pick offs and then attempted to push the lane of the fallen foe and take a tower. In the mid game it was not uncommon for a team to fight with only four players while the fifth continued to push.  As far as carries went Morphling made waves in the scene due to his ability to push and resistance to being ganked as did Lone Druid. As one might imagine Lycan and the recently added Naga Siren thrived in this metagame  or at least they would have had they not been banned nearly every game. Dark Seer and Natures Prophet occupied the offlanes of most matches due to their ability to counter-push and Invoker and Queen of Pain were often found in the middle lane for the same reason. A special mention goes to Rubick who played nearly every position apart from carry (fingers crossed for TI5).  &nbsp;  ###The International 2013 - TI3  Whenever TI3 is mentioned the first strategy that usually comes to mind is Rat Dota. Although this was the tactic which led team Alliance to victory it is important to note that this was not the predominant strategy throughout the tournament. Instead this metagame saw the rise to powerful trilanes in an effort to secure the carry some early farm as well as shut down the often elusive enemy offlaner.  Teams attempted to gain an early advantage and then press this advantage in midgame teamfights. Visage was as popular as a Doom in TI4 (more on that later) due to his strong lane presence especially when paired with a jungling Chen or support Naga Siren. In addition teams chose carries that could fight far earlier in the match such as Weaver Alchemist and Lifestealer. By doing this teams ensured that they would be ready to teamfight once they were confident of their advantage instead of being hindered by an under-farmed carry. Although Dark Seer and Natures Prophet still dominated the scene as the most common offlaners teams also added Timbersaw and Batrider to their playbooks (although the latter spent the majority of the tournament in the ban pool). Countless matches featured Puck and Dragon Knight battling it out in the middle lane with the first blood often going the way of the team whose supports ganked mid first. It is due to the meta of this tournament that Dota received the Great Offlane Patch of 79. Among other things this patch lessened the need for safe offlaners and strong trilaners the effect of which we would see in the coming tournaments.  &nbsp;  ###The International 2014 - TI4   And so here we are; in a meta where hard carries are optional and a match can be considered long by making it to the 40 minute mark. Rather than farming most teams opted to go on the early offensive in an effort to snowball out of control and their drafts reflected this. Rather than picking the more traditional carries that were seen in previous Internationals Razor and Doom populated nearly every game due to their ability to anti-carry. After all who needs a carry when you can instead shut down the enemys carry? Back in TI3 the crowd went wild upon seeing NaVi last pick Skywrath Mage a hero who was relatively unseen in pro games. One short year later he has become a first pick due to his early nuke potential and devastating silence. Shadow Shaman underwent a similar spike in popularity thanks to his ultimate which allowed teams to claim easy towers upon reaching level six. The aforementioned patch following TI3 opened teams up to a vast selection of offlane heroes which were formerly considered too risky. Tidehunter Doom and Brewmaster thrived in the short lane making use of their inherent tankiness to fend off harassment and in some matchups even threaten the lives of the enemy carries. In many ways the offlaner could be considered the most influential position since one great Ravage or Primal Split could be just the thing a team needed to begin their snowball to victory. Although the grand finals may not have been the climatic ending that many had hoped for it was a fitting representation of the metagame that was in play.  &nbsp;  In four years we have come from a game about protecting the carry to a game where the first teamfight can mean everything. We have come from a game where the offlaner is lucky if he gets a last hit to a game where he might have the highest net worth on the team. We have come from a game where no one picks Zeus to a game where still no one picks Zeus  but it is only a matter of time until the meta swings in his favor. After all *everything can work*.,article

Dota 2 BOT Major Summary,self.DotA2,## CONGRATULATION TO THE WINNER [EXTREME PUSH](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=845038351)   *2nd Place:* [RANKED MATCHMAKING AI BY:ADAMQQQ](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=855965029)   *3rd Place:* [ALCHEMIST AND HIS 4 FRIENDS](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=889890838)  If you are not familiar with the tournament you can find more info [HERE](https://redd.it/671cmh)  Finals: [GAME 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCdgI69KhJg&t=615s) [GAME 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HYNTnY-83k&t=6s) [GAME 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtH7ZDP2lkw&t=1s)  Sorry about the problems in those games (camera and UI) don't blame it on the casters blame it on me and I am gonna blame it on Valve...   ---------------------------------------------------------   In my opinion it was a good tournament group stage was not so great only 1 group was tough the rest had 2 much better teams than the rest. The biggest bot problem is not pushing enough and randoming heroes as you can see 2 out of top 3 bots play only 6 heroes max. Those bots have a good or at least decent team composition and can win games constantly bots that use many heroes depend on the heroes picked in the certain game A LOT. As far as I understand bot makers only have tools to setup drafting AI in captains draft mode however very few bots actually had drafting AI at all so I had to make the entire tournament all pick. I am really hoping that next time more bots (or all) will have captains mode drafting AI so we can make a normal tournament.   There are many things bots cannot yet do and that id due to the valve's API which I hope will be fixed very soon so we can see some even better bots I don't think these bots are bad either every bot in top 7 is better than stock bots! Even some outside of the top 7 are. I would say great job to all the bot makers with tools they have and little time they have they outplay Valve's AI NICE JOB!   I don't want this to be too long so I will finish it here with plans for the future. I intend to continue doing this until valve or some bigger Dota 2 tournament organizer takes over. Next tournament will have 16 teams that will allow me to make the competition less luck based by playing more than BO1 in the group stage and having double elimination. TOP 8 teams automatically qualified for the next tournament while 9-12 seeds will fight each other in double elimination for 2 spots bottom 2 teams from there will join rest of the bots in normal qualification rounds for which I still haven't decided the format. New seeding can be seen [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CEk6QEr2Cz59yn2QSQNisD9od9ysHQs9Po0ohAeXFJY/edit?usp=sharing)   I hope valve will decide to make this easier for me too by allowing spectators with DotaTV (directed camera) in the local servers or only bot games on their servers or at least being able to play the replay from a local server a bit  later other than just after the game and never again (sometimes not even after the game).   ----------------------------------------------------   THANK YOU EVERYONE SEE YOU COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL!!!!   I will try to answer every tournament or bot related question this time so if you have any shoot!   Have a nice day/night/morning/evening/afternoon.....,article
The first reported case of a DotA2-related medical condition: A PASTA MAC Syndrome.,self.DotA2,**Introduction**  To date the application of medical knowledge has been widely overlooked and ignored for DotA2s heroes.  There is currently no recorded description of any disease states or phenotypic abnormalities in this unique population.  Here I present the first report of a medical syndrome affecting a small number of DotA2 heroes.  Three individuals patients A B and C were selected for study based on their shared presentation of symptoms and defects.    **Background of patients**  All three male patients are from a similar background which initially made it difficult to determine whether or not their symptoms were a result of environmental effects or due to a syndrome acquired at birth.  These individuals all have a tribal upbringing and to my knowledge maintain status in their respective tribes.  Of note all three have what they might describe as magical powers due to their shared and overlapping occupations of witch doctor shaman and healer.  **Posture and gait**  As seen in [Figure 1](http://imgur.com/a/KgfSw) all three patients share a similar posture.  Kyphosis or a round/hunched back is evident and most prominently displayed in patient A.  Patient B also exhibits this abnormal stance and back curvature while patient C has a more mild case.  The variability in severity of kyphosis may be explained by patients ages as patient A is significantly older than patient C.  Walking as it relates to posture was also examined in each patient.  From the observed clips below each patient takes short quick steps which might be described as a shuffling gait.  Patient A again appears most severely affected appearing unsure on his feet.  [Patient A](https://gfycat.com/DisfiguredNiftyCopperhead)   [Patient B](https://gfycat.com/WhimsicalInsistentDunnart)   [Patient C](https://gfycat.com/DiscreteMealyAsianelephant)   **Speech**  Upon vocal examination it was found that each patient had evidence of dysarthria or slurred speech which often sounds like nonsensical guttural ramblings.  In some instances the impaired speech rendered the affecteds words incomprehensible.  Interestingly all three patients have developed their own unique imagined language possibly as a compensatory effect to their impaired speech. Multiple examples of these defects are found below:   **Patient A:**  [Made up language](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/8/80/Wdoc_attack_06.mp3)**/**[Incomprehensible](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/5/54/Wdoc_level_06.mp3)**/**[Slurred speech](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/7f/Wdoc_laugh_03.mp3 )  **Patient B:**  [Made up language](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/2/2f/Shad_ability_shackle_08.mp3)**/**[Incomprehensible](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/4/40/Shad_ability_voodoo_05.mp3)**/**[Guttural nonsense](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/5/56/Shad_ability_shackle_07.mp3)  **Patient C:**  [Incomprehensible](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/2/29/Dazz_ability_sfx_07.mp3)**/**[Incomprehensible](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/8/83/Dazz_ability_sfx_03.mp3)**/**[Guttural noise](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/7c/Dazz_ability_sfx_04.mp3)  **Congenital defects**  Given the symptoms presented thus far it remains unclear whether they can be explained by environmental causes or are potentially genetically acquired traits.  Interestingly each patient presented with two obvious congenital defects.  The first of which is macrostomia or an unusually wide mouth.  As seen in [Figure 2](http://imgur.com/a/6zPZY) each patient exhibits a mouth width that is substantially larger than average.  While the genetic cause is unknown the development of this rare craniofacial defect results from failure of fusion of the maxillary and mandibular processes.  Additionally the patients also lack digits a condition known as adactyly. Referring again to [Figure 1](http://imgur.com/a/KgfSw) it is clear that each patient lacks at least one finger.  Patients A and B also appear to have an improper number of toes which may contribute to their altered ambulation.  This defect can be due to a number of genetic causes often in genes associated with development such as NOTCH1.       **Conclusion**  This report represents the first known description of a medical syndrome in a group of DotA2 heroes.  The patients described here present a mix of what could be construed as environmentally brought-on symptoms (posture gait speech) as well as clearly congenital abnormalities (missing digits and wide mouth).  Additional family or tribal members were unavailable for study.  Given the nature of a shared background (tribe) and their congenital defects I suggest patients A B and C present symptoms which are a result of a syndrome caused by genetic bottleneck.  Based on who is affected and the defects themselves I propose to name this condition A PASTA MAC Syndrome (Abnormalities: Posture Ambulation Speech Tribally Associated with Macrostomia Adactyly; Congenital).  Whether this is an inherited or de novo condition is unclear but these patients and their relatives should continue to be monitored for the worsening or development of symptoms.  Furthermore I hope this report inspires future study into more yet to be described medical conditions amongst DotA2 heroes.     ,article

What Patch 6.82 Really Says,esportsexpress.com,,article
6.88 A - F Changes condensed into 1 changelog,self.DotA2,I flubbed the title this is 6.88b to 6.88 f.    I'll start from what the heros were in 6.88b than essentially add in every change they've had up to now. A lot has happened in the past 4 months.

How we made cheat detector. gosu.ai against cheaters,self.DotA2,Hey Reddit!  Today we will talk about how we made [cheat detector](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/8816oh/12_of_all_matches_are_played_with_cheats_check/).  **Tl;dr**: To detect cheating we extracted mouse movements and all the actions player perform on a map from replays. We define cheaters and ready to share the API with third-party developers. Right now our anti-cheat isn't perfect the system doesn't track all existing cheats but we will work hard in this direction.  [Try it out](https://dotacheat.gosu.ai/en/) and check if youve played with cheaters.  At the time of writing this article we analysed approximately 200k matches that were played by about 1 million unique players. Here we share with you some stats and tell how this system works. Further we will tell you how the anti-cheat works and share some stats.  Cheats for Dota 2 are you serious?  There are a lot of them see [this review](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7yeeh5/cheats_are_real_eng_subs/). For the beginning we have implemented algorithm that detects cheats that could be identified by tracking mouse movements and clicks in replay.  **Camera hack**  Having enabled this cheat unprincipled player is able to look at the distant places on a map with less mouse clicks and movement and faster respond to events taking place outside the screen. Note that the wide monitor does not make you a cheater because the allowed extension of the view only works in width. This is the most popular cheat we found its use in **12.24%** (sic!) of all matches. Approximately **1.1%** of all players abuse this hack and 76% of them play with unacceptable zoom in each game.  [The player clicks outside the standard camera view an additional click appears. Match ID: 3754671634 ](https://gosuaiblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/6ucbhf4tqd-1.gif?w=1100)  We found zoomout (camera distance) in 12.24% of all matches. Unique users with cheats  1.02% 76% of them used zoomout in each game.  **utomatic creep blocking**  Creep blocking is an important technique that allows mid-lane player to farm effectively at the start of the game. But what if the program will instantly click for you in a right place to stop creeps without any of your attention? Obviously this kind of automatization is unfair.  Good news there are only **0.1%** of players (one of 1000) who use this cheat in public matches but you can meet cheater in **0.5%** of matches (one of 200).  [Look at fast clicks to distant points. Match ID: 3754671634] ](https://gosuaiblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/uqrypuooy9.gif?w=1100)   **Automatic items dropping**  Quick drop and pickup of some items under certain conditions could give your hero additional bonus. For instance dropping and picking back Arcane Boots having Soul Ring gives the hero 75 freebie mana points but actually to do so you have to spend a time to move mouse to the inventory bar and return it to the map.  At least **0.035%** (350 of one million) players make those actions automatically without real mouse movement. This adds injustice to **0.328%** of matches.  [The player automatically throws items from the bag to get an additional bonus from pressing certain items. Match ID: 3730565232] ](https://gosuaiblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/6ecgfxfztr.gif?w=1100)  **How anti-cheat works**  To detect cheating we extracted mouse movements and all the actions player perform on a map from replays. To analyse player behavior we aggregate several statistics like the distance between the mouse position on a screen and the place where the players real action was registered. Then we use machine learning technique called [anomaly detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection): the algorithm learns from a sample of pure matches (manually checked by our Dota 2 experts for the absence of cheating) and then able to detect suspicious deviations from the norm.  To classify cheating behavior and estimate the accuracy of our detection we asked our experts to review random suspicious matches manually and make a strong decision  whether there was cheating or not? Statisticians call this technique an [acceptance sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_sampling). According to our current estimates the detector has less than 3% of false positives (situations when the system erroneously blames player for cheating).  An ideal algorithm is hard to build because of the large number of unique situations. We offer our deepest apologies if your play will fall into those erroneous 3%. If it will let us know by sending a feedback through This is wrong button. As mentioned before our algorithm learns on the labeled replays. So the more feedback you will send  the more accurate our anti-cheat will be.  **Lets collaborate**  We see a big problem with cheating behavior in public games but we are not going to wait until #valvefixit. So heres our offer to the Dota 2 community tournament platforms and other third-party developers: we are ready to give an access to our closed **API** for cheat-checking. If you are interested please contact Kirill Chuvakov <k@gosu.ai>.  Were going to **make Dota 2 great again!**  [Try it out](https://dotacheat.gosu.ai/en/) and check if youve played with cheaters.,article

Dota 2 Prizemoney Delays - What is actually happening,self.DotA2,There is a bit of a culture of non-discussion when it comes to industry people putting blame on Valve because there is always this fear that you or your organization can get black balled. Its the reason you see so much vaguery around the prize pool issues today. I'll try to break it down as best as i can from our side and what knowledge i have and others can add the details they know 100% in this thread.   We've been in contact with Valve for a while about ~$67k in community funding for Frankfurt. As you can imagine when it comes to finance and sending out/taxing prize money it is much simpler to do this in one payment per team or player rather than breaking this into community/tournament contribution. This seems to be the feeling amongst all other leagues too....Frankfurt prize pool from our end has been paid out except for a couple teams who asked to be able to invoice it rather than have direct transfer.  Some time during the summer Valve changed some tax form rules and had some internal delays that i dont have info on for payment to tournaments. Basically every single major tournament got hit with the delay.  - Dreamleague ESL One Starladder probably BTS (LD? Godz?) etc etc.   MLG survived it because their event was before the rule change. No - leagues did not just decide to all as a group not pay out as delicious as that sounds. Cyborgmatt can probably provide better explaination on what the issues were - to be honest i don't really think its that big of a deal because we all knew it was an issue Valve was working on. For whatever reason the players did not....   Teams and their management have been aware of these issues for a while - consider that both EG and Navi run their own tournaments which were likely affected by the tax issues. For some reason the EG players and Envy either just have no clue about these types of discussions or got salty and decided to forget. To put it in context this issue was ''big'' about 6 weeks ago when we all realized what happened but then teams/leagues started to talk and realized we were cool and just had to wait it out.  In general it's a big deal but its not a new deal and since everyone in the industry is shouting at themselves in private skype channels a public thread so explain this is probably a bit better :) . It's mostly just growing pains of the system and Valve having to adjust it so it works legally for everyone - not a trivial task.    TL;DR All the leagues are still/were waiting for their community contribution money so payments all got delayed.   Edit: I didn't make this clear initially and checked with our team this morning. Everything from our side of prizepool was paid out weeks ago except for a couple teams who asked to be able to be able to invoice rather have it wired directly. We're just waiting for community money. I dont know the status of other leagues,article

The Future of In-house Leagues,self.DotA2,"**The Future of In-house Leagues**  In-house leagues (IHL) have been a driving force in Dota for almost a decade. IHLs have cultivated competitive Dota scenes all over the world and are responsible for connecting many of todays professional players. While the concept of an in-house league is ultimately simple its impact cannot be understated. Despite their lasting influence the future of IHLs are in jeopardy. With the largest esports tournament in history on the horizon now is the perfect time to ensure the everlasting success of the IHL.  The majority of todays professional players were first recognized from their involvement in an IHL. Here are just a few examples:  	Arteezy joined Kaipi after meeting EternaLEnVy in C9-DL and became an icon through his play in NEL.  	ppd made a name for himself in HoN but met his current teammate Arteezy in NEL.  	mason began ringing for EG due to his success in NEL.  	Universe and ixmike88 entered the competitive scene through NADL and other North American IHLs.  	1437 and Universe joined OK.Nirvana.int after playing together in DCIHL.  	DeMoN made a name for himself in DXD before joining hi2u.  	MSS was originally asked to ring for Team Liquid because he was on top of the NEL ladder.  	eHug was formed with five NEL players.  	Jubei met eHug through IXDL which led to his MLG attendance and relocation to Korea.  	Shadows of the Past formed after playing together in NEL.  	Many pro Chinese players including ZSMJ YYF ChuaN Yao Mu LaNm Super cty and papaxiong have competed in CDEC the premier in-house league in China.  	EternaLEnVy met kizzles in IXDL to form the first No Tidehunter roster.  	H4nn1 Loda Akke Pajkatt MiSeRy Puppey Dendi and XBOCT have all played in in-house leagues from IHCS to EEL.  **The Importance of In-house Leagues**  The future of Dota 2 as an esport relies on fostering new talent and efficiently ushering them into the competitive scene. This is sometimes accomplished by recognizing the talent of an unknown pub star but more often than not a player turns pro after engaging in semipro competitions. Amateur and semipro team leagues have always been an important part of esports infrastructure. But semipro competition has a lot of barriers to overcome  most notably team stability. Most players cannot commit the necessary time to improve without compensation. Unfortunately esports has not yet grown to a point where semipro players can make a living wage. Its no wonder that semipro teams become discouraged and quickly disband before reaching the professional level. In the rare occasion that a player has the dedication and lifestyle to pursue a professional Dota 2 career the other four teammates are most likely not in the same situation. The team disbands and the player has to start over.  This is why IHLs are a vital complement to semipro leagues. IHLs allow a player to improve without being attached to four big question marks. Dedicated IHL players are easily recognized by their activity and desire to improve. The best players rise to the top and are either approached by pro players who also compete in the IHL or form a team with other individuals who have shown similar talent.  Of course we cannot ignore perhaps the most scrutinized aspect of IHLs the community. Nowhere else do players learn and grow as quickly as an IHL largely because of the constant interaction with other competitive players. Strategy discussions and technical tips are often the focus of an IHLs chat. Sometimes these discussions get a bit heated. Sometimes theyre serious and sometimes theyre all in good fun. Ultimately if youre feeding something is wrong and learning to take criticism is an important step to improvement. This atmosphere has historically crafted the metagame for professional competitions. Mass games with competitive players spawn trends quicker than a limited number of pro matches where teams have a lot riding on every game.   **A Brief History of In-house Leagues**  The first IHL was created by Ucross in 2005. High skilled players were invited to compete in a league in which every game had a new set of teammates and each player competed to raise their individual ranking. With only a couple hundred players disciplinary issues were handled quickly and inadequate players were removed from the league. New talent was invited by established players and was subject to a strict probationary period. The original IHL began with mostly North American players but interest quickly spread and the European IHCS was born. Since then hundreds of IHLs have existed throughout the world connecting the best Dota players in both exclusive and open communities. IHLs reached new heights in Dota 2 with the introduction of the NADotA Elite League (NEL) followed by sister leagues in Europe South America and Korea. Through todays DotaTV ticket system TwitchTV streaming sponsored prize pools and custom league software these elite leagues brought more fame and fortune to IHL players than ever before.  **The Threat**  The Elite Leagues were thriving until December 2013 when ranked matchmaking was introduced to Dota 2. Ranked matchmaking was not a surprise but it was immediately apparent that players cared more about their official Dota 2 matchmaking rating (MMR) than their NEL rating. This was confirmed after speaking to numerous NEL players many of whom preferred the exclusivity of NEL but cared more about boosting their official MMR.  **The Solution**  Integrate Elite League ratings into Dota 2. IHLs require special attention to maintain the desired skill level and to discipline appropriately. This is not the same as 6k MMR matchmaking. Matchmaking is great for quickly starting a game that will be relatively balanced. 6k players are often matched with 4k players to balance the game. Sometimes this is exactly what players want but sometimes they are willing to wait longer for a better game especially when they can see who else is playing before committing. Elite Leagues also let the best players draft their teams which has the potential to create more balanced teams with better chemistry than matchmaking.  http://i.imgur.com/01pc54q.png   **The Potential Outcome**  When I say NEL and the other Elite Leagues were thriving I mean it. The NEL viewing experience was completely different from pro tournaments. NEL provides a more casual yet highly competitive and innovative atmosphere. Industry leaders quickly took notice we expanded to four continents and had more interest from sponsors than we could have ever imagined. We were in a position to employ multiple hard working individuals full-time which is no easy feat in the esports industry. And thats really what we want  to let people do what they love. The past six months have been tough. Seeing your dream materialize before you only to vanish in an instant is nothing but demoralizing. But we know we have something special. People want to play in IHLs. People want to watch IHLs. Because of this IHLs will never truly die. But with one change they could flourish.  -- Aaron Spit-wad Stern & Michael ixmike88 Ghannam  ***  **Testimonials**  ""Well for me I was good and I kept playing inhouses. Eventually you form relationships with people if you play with them enough. In RMM it's a bit different. I said it earlier in some interview RMM ladder isn't good for finding pro players inhouses are much better. It's a better environment in almost every way.""   Mason **mason** Venne Evil Geniuses  I spammed IXDL games on the same hero and just hoped to play one of the practiced matchups versus a pro player in hopes of showing my talents off because there were a lot of observers in each IXDL game back in the day. Eventually I was defeated by pro players in matches like Korok and Dendi which made me even more hungry to get better and crush them later on because I knew I could do it if I tried.  Artour **Arteezy** Babaev Evil Geniuses   I would like to say that back then I'm just a MM player who always stack with people like sN for example. I don't know what competitive was and my english skill is really low so I dont know much things about in house like people used to play (ixdl NEL) and then I met Broodstar and he asked me to play ixdl but it wasn't fun for me and then I go back to MM. As the days progress I start to get bored of it and there was an announcement for NEL with prize pool so I decided to try it out and I got vouched by Broodstar but I was afraid to play with all those players because I thought my skills arent good enough but when I tried it it was fun and people start to noticed me and like me based on my skills and good attitudes but what I think for myself Im not a very skilled player. I always have this dream that one day I want to play in competitive scene but my english wasnt good enough to communicate to people but NEL has brought me into competitive and it helps me building my english skills with people who plays this league and then it was ixmike88 who asked me to play completive after he saw my performance in the NEL because he thought I was a good player and ixmike88 has brought me into competitive scene. I'm also still playing in-houses like ixdl and NEL as long as there are people to play but the leagues need supports to get more people to play it. Big thanks to ixmike88.  Veasna **SNA** Sokhom Sneaky Nyx Assassins  IHL's have always been a great way to introduce yourself into a competitive environment. For me in particular for being a South American player the level of play I could reach was limited due to the player skill around me. But thanks to the old IHL's back in Dota 1 I got to improve myself and join games with players way above my skill and because of it I was able to learn a lot and eventually grow as a player as well as making a name for myself. This helped me getting noticed and meeting new people who eventually would become my teammates.  William **Gudii** Aguilera No Earthspirit  Inhouses are the best way to show your true potential and get good at professional Dota 2. You can always play with good players players better than you and that is the best way to achieve something learning with the best. It has also a nice environment you can always meet new people to play with and there is no such thing as fake accounts. Another good thing about inhouses is the tickets system many people watching you play around the world with casters is very good to show your skills and get known in the International Dota 2 scenario. -- Danilo ""**Ned**"" Silva CNB e-Sports Club  I can pretty much say the only reason I'm going to compete at TI4 is because of ixmike88 and his inhouse leagues. A year ago it was only a dream of mine to compete professionally and I didn't think pro players would acknowledge me since I was a unknown player. That was until I started to play in NEL and slowly got my talent and potential recognized by pros and I eventually ended up standing in for the top tier NA teams and got asked to join teams after TI3. -- Arif ""**MSS**"" Anwar mousesports  ",article

Neichus Legendary forgotten name in Dota history development. Founding father of DoTa Allstars,self.DotA2,"Its his post on PD long ago well its gonna tl;dr    *********************************************************************************  "" The role I played in DotA's development was as a bridge between Guinsoo and IceFrog. Essentially what had happened was Guinsoo had withdrawn from much effort on the map having started a colossal upgrade but then having lost interest in the meantime. After a period of this where it was obvious the map was dying without updates or attention I forcibly took over the project from Guinsoo.  At this point I was the project head for a period of time. I never put my name on the map; I just changed it from ""Guinsoo's DotA"" to ""DotA Allstars"" and left it at that. This probably is why I'm relatively unknown. I did a lot of hero work; Pudge (my favorite) Earthshaker Tiny 2.0 Bristleback Sandking Axe Phantom Lancer 2.0 Stealth Assassin 2.0 Ursa Warrior Broodmother Shadow Fiend Nerubian Weaver Enchantress Ogre Magi Tinker Necro'lic 2.0 Necrolyte Enigma and Death Prophet 2.0 would all either be dramatically different or not even in the game (although I've noticed a few have changed far beyond what I originally did). I also did a lot of quality of life work like organizing icons and being the first to add tooltips to the item combinations. IceFrog at that point was one of the people I worked with; as he had formal programming training and I had none (I'm a biology graduate student) he was far more proficient than I when it came to computers.  After a few months of heading the project I became really disenchanted with the whole thing. I mostly did this for fun in my spare time while in college but it was frustrating to spend hours of work on fixing bugs or coming up with novel ideas only to be ripped on for something else. So I basically dropped the thing (somewhat unfairly) on IceFrog's lap and left. Been interesting to see how it's evolved over the years and certainly best of luck to him in developing DotA with Valve.  Anyway hope that helps fill in some of the holes in the history. ""    *********************************************************************************   "" Axe: Of my design. His original version didn't have Battle Hunger speeding Axe up nor Culling Blade boosting ally movement. Probably good advancements since his original form had practically no pursuit power.  Bristleback: This was another guy's idea that was put in under my watch where I had some input on the refinement of the idea but it was somebody else's baby.  Doom Bringer: Like Tiny Doom Bringer was already in the game when I came around. I was just involved in giving him a facelift from his old version which was only a moderately changed Pit Lord from WarCraft 3 (although the new mechanic with him acquiring neutral abilities on Devour isn't mine but is very cool).  Pudge: My pride and joy. What some of you might not know is that the current Pudge is actually the second Butcher that was put into the game. His first incarnation was as a summoner/pusher. He had the ability to store corpses like a Meat Wagon and then raise them. However his ultimate was probably the most broken spell ever in DotA: Carrion Flies. The flies were a small weak summon that were able to raise more of themselves. This would unfortunately result in Pudge being able to push an entire lane...while sitting in his base because the flies would increase in number faster than they'd die out. They were doubly horrible because they had no collision size so you'd see one fly....then die because it was actually 50 of them stacked on top of each other. Yeah he got outright banned by people in public games.  It's been interesting to see how since his inception he's sort of permeated back into Blizzard's design. If you play World of WarCraft you'll notice that many of the abominations now have hooking moves and in Diablo 3 their Butcher also has a similar move.  Sandking: Of my design. His entire design came just from the fact that I found out that the scorpion models had a burrow animation and I really wanted to use it. He's probably one of my heroes that has gone through more changes than most simply because he was such a boom-or-bust hero that was hard to balance. The original Epicenter stayed where it was cast rather than following the Sandking. Slight adjustments in casting and stun times between Burrowstrike and Epicenter either made him way too powerful or completely incapable of getting his combo off.  Morphling: Of my design. First hero I ever got into DotA while Guinsoo was still project head. He's also undergone quite a few changes like Sandking. His signature ability to convert Strength and Agility was there as was Waveform but that's about it. His ultimate is now Rubrick's (although my version was far more unwieldy to use) and I don't even recall what he had in place of Adaptive Strike.  Naga Siren: Already in game I just invented her Song ultimate to replace whatever was there before (I don't even remember what it was).  Phantom Lancer: Of my design. Another case like Tiny where the hero was in before I came but was removed. I just brought it ""back"" using the original as an inspiration.  Stealth Assassin: Another case like Doom Bringer where the hero was in the game but I was involved in a heavy revamp. He already had perma-invis but his old ultimate was Death Ward (same as the Witch Doctor except non-channeling). We nixed for the same reason Sandking had balance issues where the hero's whole power depended on a single combo murdering the opponent before they could react. Smoke Screen and Backstab are my particular additions.  Ursa Warrior: Of my design. Fuzzy Wuzzy was the first hero to have a ""secret"" name. Fun fact is that his original version is that he was technically a ranged hero. Fury Swipes is based off of the Firelord's ability and the ability just wouldn't work when you put it on a melee hero. So he was actually a ""ranged"" hero in disguise to make it work.  Broodmother: Of my design. One of my personal favorites just because I like arthropods.  Nerubian Weaver: Of my design. In a twist of irony I gave him a ""useless"" ability that ended up being removed and would probably have now been considered overpowered. I had the whole idea in my head of Shukuchi/Geminate/Time Lapse but I couldn't think of a 4th ability that fit. After a while I basically gave up and awarded him the ability to summon invisible Shades which he could position around the map giving him good vision of different areas. Yep he had free everlasting mobile wards. Of course back then wards weren't in vogue (in fact it was around my time that consumables were even introduced) so this ability was considered trash and skipped. I don't know when it was changed to the new swarm ability.  Shadow Fiend: Of my design. Ultimate has since been changed. His original ultimate was a set of orbs which floated around him that he could expand and contract like a permanent version of the Guardian Wisp ability. I am however glad to see that Shadowraze has stayed around; it was an experimental ability that I knew was hard to control when I put it in so glad to see that better players than I have made good use of it.  Enchantress: Of my design. Ultimate was originally Untouchable and Impetus was a basic ability but other than that she still had the same set of abilities. Her healing ability is actually a variant of the War3 Crypt Lord swarm with a bunch of little units having auto-cast heal turned on. Recently picked up Dota 2 and she's probably one of my favorites to play as a support who can also sting when needed.  Keeper of the Light: I was involved in him but I don't remember much else except working on Illuminate at some point. His original ultimate was an ungodly annoying pushing tool a sort of Porta-Furion that could teleport around the map and summon support wisps to help fight.  Zeus: Already in the game I just added in Static Field since he became rapidly useless past the early-mid game without the ability to weaken stronger opponents.  Tinker: Of my design. Fun fact is that Heat Seeking Missiles is Fan of Knives with a HUGE radius and small target limit. His ultimate actually stems from a limitation in the WarCraft 3 engine. There is no way to reset individual abilities in triggers so you either reset everything or not. Otherwise he might have ended up quite differently.  Ogre Magi: Of my design.  Bane: I was involved in him. Like the Bristleback he was somebody else's baby but I did the coding and refinement from the initial ideas.  Death Prophet: Already in the game but I put in Witchcraft so that like Zeus her damage potential wouldn't just tank in the mid game against stronger heroes.  Enigma: Somebody else's idea which I refined and coded. Blackhole however is my invention.  Necrolyte: Of my design. As a somewhat embarrassing anecdote I was unaware of certain definitions when designing him. His original name was ""Necrophiliac"" since I figured he was affiliated with the dead. It was only brought to my attention later that I should probably rename him.  Visage: My version has since been overwritten. He was in the game previously and the gargoyles had always been his ultimate. I introduced Grave Chill as well as some other abilities to him. Soul Assumption is not of my design nor is the new Gravekeeper's Cloak.  Misc.  Courier: Originally my idea. If the website lets me link URLs I have a funny old picture of the original version equipped with a Dagon killing somebody (since it didn't have the limitations of the current couriers).  Items: I didn't do a lot with item invention mostly I just sorted them. I did however introduce the Bracer and Wraith Band (originally Null Talisman was the only early game tri-stat) as well as the Refresher Orb (since it was basically the same idea as the Tinker).  And whew I think that covers most of what I was involved in. ""   *********************************************************************************   We should at least remember his name ",article
Results of my Master thesis survey about why we buy skins in MOBA games.,self.DotA2,Due to limited space the infographic and the full post contains more details and more facts than this Reddit post.  Repost from /r/leagueoflegends I did not post it on the same time to avoid reddit hug on the servers im hosting the content on.  The infographic for a quick overview: http://www.e-solution.dk/freemium-infographic/  Imgur mirror here: http://imgur.com/a/emOo1?reg  If you want to read the results in detail you can find them here: http://www.e-solution.dk/freemium/  **Purpose:** To figure out one simple thing: **Why do people buy in-game virtual items that have no functionality at all?**. I decided that my case should be based around freemium MOBA games.  The idea is that if you can figure out why people buy virtual items they dont need then it might be possible for businesses selling actual services like Spotify Dropbox and Skype. **MOBA games have a freemium to premium conversion rate on 90%!** Spotify got 33% Skype 10% and Dropbox 1%.   **Here are the results:**  **Demographics:** As stated in earlier studies there is no difference between gamers buying behavior between Europe and America the only slight difference is that MOBA gamers from America enjoy buying skins more for the simple reason of fun and had a higher score in the following statements (called hedonic motives): Skins are enjoyable and Skins are very entertaining than their European counterparts.  At the same time there was a correlation between age and hedonic motives. Earlier studies from other businesses support this statement as well which means that the younger people are the more they buy skins because it is fun. The difference is actually quite big.  I measured 6 factors that decide buying behavior. The way I found those factors was looking into previous studies for buying behavior in virtual worlds. I then made a pilot test where people would suggest why they bought skins and it ended up being these 6 items that were relevant. Each factor was measured with 3-4 different questions and what you see below are the averages of these questions. The item passed the hypothesis with 2 out of 5.  **Hedonic motives (373 out of 5):** Hedonic motives are players that buy skins simply because it is fun and exciting. This was the highest factor.  **Customization (315 out of 5):** This was rated as the 2nd highest. Players bought skins to customize their gaming experience or simply because they didnt like the classic skin. There is probably a business opportunity hidden here by making original skins ugly. (Kidding... hopefully...). Fun fact in World of Warcraft one of the most used enchants in Vanilla (the first WoW game) was Beastslayer it was completely useless (mostly) but the red glow was very appealing to people. People do a lot for cosmetics. There have been made academic papers about that topic.   **Habit (255 out of 5):** simply because the price is low and it is easy to buy skins.  **Attention (206 out of 5):** Some people like attention even though they dont want to admit it.  **To support esports (206 out of 5):** a lot of MOBA games is pouring a lot of money in the esport scene people feel like they can support e-sport by supporting the games. The questions showed that players wanted mainly to support the game company (RIOT or VALVE) and werent that interested in supporting individual esports teams.  **Social pressure (178 out of 5 FAILED):** the answers showed that friends dont pressure each other to buy skins. However the questionnaire showed that if you play with friends you will buy more skins.  Negative factors are not significant and didnt show to be important. **This means that even if you disagree with the game company you will still buy skins.**  **Gifting: 74% of the players bought gifts to friends** and people who bought gifts spend more money on the game in general!  I will lurk around in this thread and answer questions.  **TL:DR: Read the Infographic here: http://www.e-solution.dk/freemium-infographic/**   Edit: Also note: that all who took the surveys was from reddit and forums that means that the people are probably highly engaged in the game.  ,article
Valve We need a BIG BOT/BOOSTER Cleanup! It's also simple to implement!,self.DotA2,"##**The Issue** Dota is being ruined! The game is being destroyed by botters and account boosters. Anyone who plays in ranked match making has surely come across an account buyer. Today I was ""lucky"" enough to come across another.  After checking the account on Dotabuff I was able to find a very simple pattern that these bots all share and I believe Valve could be doing more to either punish or prevent these accounts from ever reaching your games.   For the sake of proof i'll be using the following account to show you evidence of easy to find bots and boosted accounts. https://www.dotabuff.com/players/379058169 *** ##**Easily Identifiable Proof of Botting**   The following is easily identifiable I believe   * [If you check the very first game you'll find that it's played in and against a bot 5 stack.](http://i.imgur.com/pCWHThm.jpg)   * [If you check the very last ""Normal"" game you'll find that it's played in and against the exact same bot 5 stack.](http://i.imgur.com/OtAAzoK.jpg)  * You'll also notice every one of these games take place on the [South Korean server](http://i.imgur.com/bKACo60.jpg).  * [Once the account has reached level 20 It then plays 10 ranked matches to calibrate.](http://i.imgur.com/tLzpjC1.jpg) You can see the difference between the bots playing and the actual human playing. These 10 matches are played on the[ Europe West server](http://i.imgur.com/wjLepnx.jpg).  * [After these 10 games and the account has been calibrated it is then sold to a player who is now excited to ruin your games! In this case the account was sold to an Australian buyer who you can see struggles to play at the MMR the account was calibrated for.](http://i.imgur.com/yUx2vPZ.jpg)  ***  At the time of writing this post the account and the new owner have ruined **71** ranked games and any wins on the account show that the owner was severely carried.  I'm sure Valve can easily input these above variables and flag multiple accounts that are this obvious. We might not be able to stop every account but Valve should be making it as hard as possible for this to take place.  ***  **edit:** With a quick google you can even find the ad that the booster used to sell the account. [See here](http://i.imgur.com/f20ahwQ.jpg) The account was 4.8k when sold and has already fallen to ~ 4.2k.  **edit 2:** If you take a look at the website where this account was sold - [See Here](http://i.imgur.com/yqF4ywM.jpg) - You can see 5000+ accounts sold in the first stickied thread. You can also see 250000 views on the front page alone. All of these posts were commented on in the last day. Why is this so easy to do? Why can one person sell 5000 accounts?  ***  ##**Hate Reading? - Video Here!**  Here's a video by ChiLongQua that he released just 2 weeks ago about the exact same issue. [See Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA-rFPpBDr8)  We need other Dota personalities to speak out about this issue!  *** How can Valve ignore such a huge issue that directly impacts Dota 2 and the player-base? If we don't fix this it'll only get worse! ***  ##**Solution?**  Valve need to make it as hard as possible for the botter. The awesome thing about Valve developing Dota is that they also develop Steam and have access to the players library (or lack there of in this case). If we had an algorithm that looked for the following on an account and if it met every point then it was banned or even flagged as a possible bought account. Valve could then implement a fourth report item ""Suspected purchased account"" and if the account was already flagged by Valves automatic system and received 'X' reports from players then it lost the ability to play in ranked.  * New steam account with only Dota 2 (Free games) on it. * Friends on the account? Steam community set up on the account? * No communication during games from Dota level 1 to 20. * All games played in order to reach Dota level 1 to 20 are played in a party that dies 20+ times every game by constantly feeding. * Level 1 - 20 games are played on server 'X' * MMR Calibration are played on server 'Y' * Games after 10 MMR calibration games are played on server 'Z'  The above won't catch every account but every time Valve make it harder and more time consuming for a user to profit off of this then they're closer to making the effort required higher than the reward received in which case people will cease to do it.  Even if they looked at the data like the account received a hat for a hero whilst they were in their level 1 - 20 games and they didn't equip it or they didn't even view the notification then it gets flagged to complete a simple captcha (Think Dota2 recipe game type Captcha)  **Machine learning?** - Would it be difficult for Valve to teach a computer system what's a player and what's a dumb bot used to level an account?  -  * Players communicate with one another * Players buy real items and follow a 'relative' build per hero * Players interact with the map and ward/ping * Players report and commend one another * Players have 'X' APM * Bots don't watch live games in the client * Bots feed multiple kills all game and have 0/50+ K/D/A * Bots don't communicate * Bots don't report or commend * Current bots used to level don't act human in the slightest  You'd only have to check this on accounts who sit at level 1-20 or who have gone from 1-20 in a short period of time. Even if someone eventually was able to make the bots pass all the above then they've at least had to work for it. They've spent time making the bot bypass the system whereas they would have just been producing and selling accounts in that same time period.  ##**So How Does Google Do It??** If Google can tell the difference between a human and a bot that's only purpose is to solve captcha based purely off of mouse movement on a website then why can't Valve tell the difference between a human and a dumb bot in something as intricate and complex as a 30+ minute game of Dota?   The whole reason we have [reCAPTCHA](https://imgur.com/5PRzsXf.jpg) is because Google observes a users interactions and determines if it is a computer or a human and if it's unsure it just asks you.   > One advantage that Google has over other companies is huge amount of data. That data also includes the way you move your mouse on the screen. The way a human moves the mouse before checking the checkbox can be distinct from how a program (a bot) checks a checkbox. It's a game of prediction. Somehow Google needs to predict whether you are human or a bot from what you do on their site. So first a system needs to be trained to predict whether the user is human or not. For this you need training data (which Google has plenty). That data includes sample movements of mouse made by humans as well as robots (programs). Using this training data a predictive model is made. So when you move your mouse to check the checkbox. That movement is an input to the model and based on that it's predicted whether you are human or not. If you are then fine otherwise the same old method of filtering humans through a distorted image is used.   Based purely on that you could look at how bots accept a match and probably get rid of half of them right away. Valve could implement this into the main client. How many times does a bot visit the Heroes page or the Store? Probably never! Why doesn't Valve look at mouse movement in the client whilst the game is taking place?. There is so much that could be done just need to start somewhere!   I'm also positive Valve could design and implement a much better system than what I've listed above with what they have at their disposal.   ",article
An analysis of climate change in DotA2: increased pick rates of climate-endangering TI6 meta heroes negatively impacts a vulnerable hero sub-population.,self.DotA2,**TL;DR:** The TI6 meta led to increased pick rates of environmentally harmful heroes which in turn negatively affected the success of a hero sub-population.  Before I begin I humbly ask anyone who would be willing to take a few minutes of their time to [please fill out this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaZc13dWRtvlsSPJalQQuyn_ZI-6mbVDOH9nEttU3rjcob1g/viewform) for an upcoming analysis. I appreciate your help thank you very much!  Hello Everyone  Another International has come and passed and in its wake has left the typical passion excitement and of course monetary rewards. The typical fan finds themselves caught up in this gaming whirlwind without thinking about many of the secondary effects that ripple from each TI. Hero picks in public games often become influenced by the unique meta that blossomed within the tournament. Granted while nearly all of the available heroes were picked this TI there are obvious standouts that were picked most oftenthis doesnt go unnoticed by the millions tuning in. When heroes are over-represented in such a high profile public showing it is expected that those trends may carry-over into public games. This analysis seeks to study some of these trends from TI6 and explore the potential dangers that they may pose to some of DotA2s most vulnerable heroes.  Climate change has become an increasingly recognizable threat to the planet. Whatever your beliefs are concerning its cause overwhelming scientific evidence suggests it is happening. However the lasting effects of climate change are not immediately obvious. While recent data shows the past months/years as being the hottest on record we only have predictions and models to hypothesize what detrimental changes might take place in the next 50+ years. This includes sea levels rising water supplies becoming short air pollution and the like. To many the immediate effects of climate change are more opaque and there are less drastic concerns to point at and say Look at this horrible thing! Sure we may get [the occasional reminder that snow will melt indoors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E0a_60PMR8) or that somewhere out there in the Arctic theres a polar bear missing out on the smooth refreshing taste of a Coca-Cola because of too small few and far between ice floats but those arent exactly pressing concerns. Regardless the most notable examples of now-impacting climate change are already vulnerable species or those who are becoming increasingly threatened due to changes in their environment via climate change.  Whether players think about it or not DotA2 has its own natural environment. A diverse set of living beings inhabit a world filled with extensive forest flowing water and unique geological topography. As such it stands to reason that this ecosystem and its inhabitants could be affected by hero-made climate change. As an example Treant Protector (a tree who utilizes other trees for survival) might be negatively influenced by heroes causing deforestation such as Engima (midnight pulse). Worrisomely the aforementioned over-represented meta heroes this International have the potential to negatively impact the climate. **Therefore I hypothesize that the increase of climate-endangering heroes in public games as a result of their popularity in TI6 directly leads to negative outcomes for heroes especially vulnerable to these micro environmental fluctuations.**  For the purposes of this study I chose four (4) meta heroes prominently featured in TI6: Batrider Shadow Demon Timbersaw and Elder Titan. As a result of these heroes popularity among drafters a clearly observable increase in their pick rates is observed during TI6 ([Figure 1](http://imgur.com/a/RkmiY)). These four heroes each contributes to climate change as follows:  **Timbersaw:** Widely considered the principal culprit and chief advocate of deforestation this chain-saw wielding imp causes the highest rate of tree-loss per hour out of all heroes. As if that wasnt enough a constant stream of pollution bellows from his engine in the form of soot-black emissions.  **Batrider:** Instead of slowly trapping heat in the atmosphere via greenhouse gasses Batrider cuts out the middle-man and simply engulfs the map in flames. His spread of long-lasting fires not to mention disgusting black tar leaves irreparable damage in its wake. And while hes not quite as bad as Timbersaw this bat rider is no friend to trees either.  **Shadow Demon:** Shadow Demons influences on climate change may not be outwardly as obvious as the previous two heroes. While he doesnt release pollution or set the world on fire he does contribute to another key area of climate concern; overpopulation. With an ability to directly clone another hero (twice!) Shadow Demon not only effectively triples the hero population but also increases the size of that populations eco-footprint three fold ([Figure 2](http://imgur.com/a/smAPX)).  **Elder Titan:** Yeah like ripping a giant gash in the earth isnt going to cause problems.  Having outlined the potential climate-harming effects of the above heroes and having shown their increased pick rates I then picked four (4) of what I postulated to be the most susceptible heroes to these changes. If we consider warming then ice heroes (like polar bears) are likely to see more immediate impacts on their overall success due to increased pick rates of climate-detrimental heroes. Therefore the win-rates of Ancient Apparition Crystal Maiden Tusk and Winter Wyvern were closely examined for changes as a result of TI6-influenced hero trends. The results are presented here in [Figure 3](http://imgur.com/a/HIrEW).  Alarmingly each ice hero shows a significant drop in winning percentage during the same time period in which the climate-harming TI6 meta heroes saw a bump in pick rates. It was not altogether surprising to see already vulnerable heroes like Tusk who had an established low win-rate (41%) be further harmed by climate change. What is more shocking however is that even an otherwise successful ice hero like Crystal Maiden (55% win rate) saw a dip in her success as well. **These results highlight the very immediate short-term consequences of DotA2 climate change on threatened hero populations.**  While these consequences were partially mitigated in correlation with decreased pick rates of climate-damaging heroes it is important to consider the possible long term effects of picking heroes who promote climate change. By using advanced statistical algorithms and predictive modeling I calculated how the win rates of the four ice heroes might look in the next 50 years if environmentally-destructive heroes continued to be pick at high rates ([Figure 4](http://imgur.com/a/wfrrM)). These models present a bleak stark future; a world in which some of our most treasured and endangered heroes could never win a game of DotA2 again.  In conclusion these data present the first evidence to date of climate change negatively impacting heroes within the DotA2 environment. Importantly these negative effects seemed to be a result of environmentally unfriendly heroes being picked at higher rates. This in itself was a result of hero trends that became popularized by the TI6 meta. **The DotA2 public as a whole has a responsibility to reduce their use of climate-harming heroes while prioritizing more eco-friendly ones. Even more so the professionals who are so often idolized and emulated must be conscious of their drafts and be aware the public will follow their lead.** All it takes is one set of polluting heroes to cause harm to our DotA2 world.

"Stop telling new players that choosing mid or ""high impact heroes"" will increase their mmr",self.DotA2,"I don't know if it's the vocal minority or what but this is getting ridiculous. You don't have to play the carry in order to force the outcome of your game to be a victory and the reason why should be obvious. The amount of times I've seen this sub complain about 5 carry teams is proof that having supports will improve your teams chances of winning. That's because they're important. (I.E not ""low-impact"" as I saw someone in this sub calling them)  So my problem here is the cult-ridden fascination with people demanding that you just ""Go mid stomp win your lane win the game"" in order to improve. That's not improving the same way that playing Riki every single game doesn't help new players improve.   You can have a high impact on whatever hero you want. And no I don't mean you carry with a support I mean you buy the wards roam the map create space so that someone else can carry you. Because believe me there are going to be people who will volunteer to play the carry role. And if you are successful at creating space/ making the game hell for the other team then you will have formed an impact. This is not to discredit the mid role I fucking love playing mid.   But if you're going to tell me that Akke's Chen didn't have an impact if Pieliedie's Wisp was just worthless if Chuan's Enchantress didn't blow you away if Maelk's Venomancer didn't send chills down your fucking spine and win the day...  You want to know how to raise your mmr? Play the damn game.  Edit: Some people have been saying that this post is saying ""Choose support every game."" It's not. But in the discussion of high-impact heroes supports should not be left out. Abaddon and Lich have the second highest winrates in the game atm it's gotta be for a reason. If you don't want to play support fine. Then don't. But do not use the excuse of ""Supports just don't do anything."" Dota is a team game to win you need to play like a team.",article

An in depth analysis of Silencer: Does he really want us all to shut up?,self.DotA2,"**Introduction**  Silencer has long been one of my favorite heroes. The general design of the hero is to efficiently make your opponents shut up while also over time dumbing them down to the point where they can no longer muster any words allowing you can happily put them out of their misery via your idiot-killer glaives.   However does Silencer truly want to shut people up or is his persona a ruse in order to hide an ulterior more sinister motive? Let's find out.  **Analysis: Voice lines**  Let's take a look at Silencer's voice lines. By my count there are 270 voice lines for Silencer. Now we search his voice lines for evidence of attempts at silencing the enemy; words like ""silence"" or ""quiet"" or lines containing ""shh"" count towards this.     Phrase or expression | Count | Percentage of total voice lines |  ---|---|----| ""Shh"" | 8 | 2.96% |  ""Hush"" ""Shush"" | 3 | 1.11% |  ""Silence"" (excluding refrences to Silencer himself) | 18 | 6.66% |  ""Quiet"" | 7 | 2.59% |  ""Shut"" (up it) | 6 | 2.22% |  ""Hear"" in the context of not hearing anything (ex. ""I don't even want to hear it"") | 8 | 2.96% |  [Lines referring to silencing Storm Spirit](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/78/Silen_rival_07.mp3) | 1 | 0.37%|  **Total** | **51**| **18.89%** |    As clearly shown by the data only 18.89% of Silencer's lines less than 1/5 of them actually refer to silence or silencing enemies. What do the rest of them refer to?  Phrase or expression | Count | Percentage of total voice lines |  ---|---|----| ""Ha"" or general laughter | 23 | 8.52% |  ""Uh!"" ""Oh!"" and other expressions of pain | 18 | 6.67% |  Lines containing an exclamation point (Which implies loudness not silence) (excludes lines contained in previous set of data) | 54 | 20.00% |   **Total** | **95**| **35.19%** |   This is shocking data. 35% of Silencer's voice lines involve a loud expression of laughter pain or otherwise exclamatory action. This is nearly double the amount of lines referring to silent actions. This discovery led me to investigate further this time into Silencer's multitude of motions in game.  **Analysis: In game movements**  For simplicity's sake in testing I used one of my unused effigies from TI4 (Let's be honest who cares about these things anyways other than for stupid poses and memes). Of the thirteen available animations which are usable for posing only one the VICTORY animation contained any traces of Silencer motioning to silence an enemy. [Seen here](http://imgur.com/sfmSZUk) the pose shows Silencer sticking his index finger in front of his lips a common motion used to tell others to be quiet. With this one animation only being 7.69% of the available animations it is clear that Silencer does not spend a majority of his time trying to silence others.  **Conclusions: What is Silencer's true motive?**  It is clear through the collected data that Silencer's main motives as demonstrated through his voice lines and in-game motions do not actually involve Silencing others.   My theory based on the relative data is that Silencer is not concerned with Silencing others but concerned more with making sure he can talk more than others. The frequency of laughter lines and even his ability ""Last Word"" imply that Silencer is in fact very concerned with getting the final say in a conversation even with his enemies. By stealing intelligence and gaining it himself he is able to gain quick wits and a way with words that no other hero can accomplish while simultaneously making his opponents dumber and unable to come up with an adequate response. He frequently uses exclamatory statements to emphasize his own importance while pushing down others too.  Please I would love to hear your counterarguments in the comments. I look forward to discussing this issue.   TL;DR: Silencer doesn't want people to shut up he wants to act better than others while laughing at them.  ",article
To know ACE records from their meeting.,self.DotA2,Hi there I'd like to introduce **Association of China E-sports (ACE)** to all of you through some screenshots of chat log from their meeting. All of these shots come from a long weibo:  *[WINGS](http://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404108574992289589)  (translation:All what I know about WINGS issue)*  written by **VK** a member of **ACE** vice president of **Invictus Gaming**.  &nbsp;  Please note the speaker on the right hand side is **VK** while on the other side it may refer to **ANY** ACE member but **VK**.   ---         [screenshot 1](http://imgur.com/a/ILTC8) translation:  **left**: Is that everyone OK?  **left**: @*ALL* Is that everyone OK?  **left**: [emoji]  **left**: OK   **left**: 1  **left**: 1  **left**: VK are you here?  **VK**: Please go on  **VK**: You already told me everything and I have very little to say.  ---        [screenshot 2](http://imgur.com/a/sasrS) translation:  **left**: It is really hard to accept that Ex-wings players left unilaterally.   **left**: Worse more VALVE always stands by players' side.    **left**: Because they are WINGS people will definitely stand by their side.  **left**: Clubs should have more control on their contract players and ACE should care more about club's interests. In the future ACE also needs to define clearly about contract termination.     ---       [screenshot 3](http://imgur.com/a/Idxlg) translation:  **VK**: Did ex-wings players signed ACE regulations or not?   **VK**: Not?     **VK**: So we need to confirm whether they signed it or not.  **left**: In the future no one will feel confident to invest money in clubs because they(ex-wings players) terminated contract that way.  **left**: I suggest that we protect clubs interests.  ---   [screenshot 4](http://imgur.com/a/gMWD6) translation:  **left**: Yesterday one boss of a club expressed the worry about things like this. A non-ACE club can easily destroy one ACE club this way because all he needs to do is to sign all the players and form a team with a different name.     **left**: Even they(ex-wings players) followed Chinese Labor Law they still need to wait for a a court judgment or arbitration. [(This is a lie)](http://redd.it/6czrnp)  **VK**: What ACE can do is only a ban nothing else.  **VK**: Anything else?  ---        [screenshot 5](http://imgur.com/a/1R0UA) translation:  **VK**: According to Chinese Labor Law they(ex-wings players) are certainly free to leave.   **VK**: But this is bullshit.     **left**: We need to explain this issue to all dota fans.  **left**: In my opinion all clubs should follow ACE regulations. Under this condition players can follow their own regulation. ACE is founded in order to help both clubs and players. If one of them does not follow ACE regulations ACE should punish it.  ---  [screenshot 6](http://imgur.com/a/jvGWg) translation:  **left**: 1   **left**: Agree on ban + resist.     **left**: Our earlier meeting this year discussed whether we should continue to invest on clubs or not.. If players do things this way we have to stick together to make sure the survival of clubs.  **left**: We can ban them indefinitely until they apply next time. At that time we then decide whether we accept them or not.   **left**: Ban + resist + 1.   ---  [screenshot 7](http://imgur.com/a/ue1DN) translation:  **left**: We must suppress this kind of acts or how can we benefit from running clubs.   **left**: 1  **left**: 1  **left**: +1   **left**: 1   **left**: I support.   ---  [screenshot 8](http://imgur.com/a/Xnuul) translation:  **left**: We must all agree on this and do it.  **left**: Every industry has its own guidelines.  **left**: If players succeeded then care little about club leave the club easily then none of the clubs is confident to raise new players. By the way they are not playing well this year.    **left**: ACE is composed of clubs not players. So they left wings club it is natural that they are not qualified to any ACE matches.   **left**: Just do it.   ---  [screenshot 9](http://imgur.com/a/u2NGv) translation:  **left**: Is the representative from wings here?  **left**: Let's suppose in October all players' contracts expire they all will be free on market. Do it mean that no ban or resist anymore?   **left**: Team Random is a non-ACE team wings has no player it is reasonable to exclude wings from ACE.    **VK**: Is the representative from wings here?  **left**: Not here.   ---  [screenshot 10](http://imgur.com/a/OFFrl) translation:  **left**: We should consider carefully here.  **left**: A lifelong ban or 2 years?   **left**: If we ban them permanently we feel we will be unfavorable to public opinion.  **left**: This is just a private agreement. We can act as if there is no regulation to judge this issue. No one says that we are not allowed to accept these players. The only problem is that we do not welcome these players.  **left**: Yeah its not the case that we are prohibited to accept them. We are unwilling to accept them.  ---  [screenshot 11](http://imgur.com/a/a0A7Q) translation:  **left**: It is not the fear of punishment from ACE that prevents us from accepting them (ex-wings players).   **left**: It is not the punishment from ACE.  **left**: The only reason is that we are unwilling to play with you guys anymore.  **left**: We are too scared of taking the risk to accept you guys.  **left**: It is not proper to say that ACE interfered this decision...  **left**: We are not friends anymore.  **left**: It is that we are not playing with you anymore.   ---  [screenshot 12](http://imgur.com/a/cb5K1) translation:  **VK**: 888(Bye-bye-bye) I am leaving.  **left**: I am leaving.  **left**: We are playing a game we have our own rules. Someone who violated the rule he is isolated by others. This is our tacit agreement but there is no such regulation in paper.  **left**: No problem.  **left**: No problem.  **left**: Support.  ---  [screenshot 13](http://imgur.com/a/fbhzE) translation:  **EHOME**: No problem. I think we need to tell coaches.  **left**: No problem.  **left**: No problem I am leaving.  **left**: No problem.  **left**: I am leaving.  **left**: Thanks for your effort. 888 (bye-bye-bye)  ---,article

give your struggling PMA attitude a 180 with AMP: Adaptive Mental Posture,self.DotA2,"Edit; for a TL;DR just scroll down to ""the solution"" section and the table below it to get the principles of AMP without the discussion/setup.  Positive Mental Attitude (PMA) was a wonderful concept.  That one should approach each game with optimism and maintain it throughout while ideally leading your team to victory by preventing tilt.  Up front this is still a good idea and I support optimistic attitudes.  Unfortunately *PMA is a stale concept and we need a mental attitude refresh.* The problems arise when most players simply cant maintain PMA or use it as a shield to demand happy compliance from their teammates without regard to their teammates abilities.  PMA now carries an implicit assumption that constant communication strategic discussion and advice to teammates is a core continuous function of the PMA player.  Unfortunately this ideal often fails to materialize.  While personalities like Slacks execute PMA with genuine good attitude (mostly) and simply keep high morale most players translate PMA into the belief that they must personally drive all 5 heroes to victory in gameplay aspects not just morale aspects.  *This is wrong* and its increasingly ruining games as people stray further from the base idea.  Look I know.  *You are a high information player.* You watch pro games. You study replays from the top players.  You used promocode BSJ.  You read my guide on /r/learndota2 about depth analysis and memorized the Great Dota Novel written by /u/circis1 on Thought Process of a 6k.  You post to or read /r/truedota2. And mostly high information is a great thing.  Reviewing and analyzing lower mmr players games over at LD2 people are buying smoke and dust in 2k and 3k.  Theyre getting BKB at all MMRs (granted not always at the right time).  Raw game knowledge even for low information players is increasing massively. The focus of what makes a good dota player is changing from rote knowledge of itemization to execution knowledge of timing and mechanical skill at all levels.  #The Problem:  *""High-information players"" (ones that read guides watch videos and pro games etc.) are increasingly vocal and angry about attempting to control their teams decisions based on what they know about competitive/pro dota across all brackets and increasingly allowing it to influence their attitude and play from the draft screen.* PMA has become a watchword for entitled Dota players to use as a shield to demand compliance from teammates they should consider equals.  Too many high information players expect that they have a duty and even a right to lead their team. As a result they tilt themselves and their team by being overbearing with strategic advice and constant criticism of four other players. Additionally they assume that allies should follow their suggestions and have the same beliefs about proper Dota as they do insistently arguing over actions they disagree with as early as the draft screen.  More to the point these players in lower brackets are often outright wrong with their suggestions or *overvalue complex professional draft choices compared to key fundamentals like damage disable and actual player skill in pub games.*  How often has a game gone like this?  Edit: *shortened the example* Draft starts -- enemy LC: Ally Void: enemy Pudge: ally Mid Arc: enemy Storm.  Ally carry is showing Drow and other ally is showing dazzle safelane our example high information player still hasnt placed lane marker *because they want to see what counters enemy best* but they repeatedly request that ally pick a more durable carry. They draft their own hero 3rd after enemy storm They pick Skywrath Mage because they think SWM Ult counters duel and synergizes with chrono and has a long silence for storm.  They then get very angry when ally picks Drow anyways using the remaining draft period to type multiple lines of invective why the pick was bad.  So they enter the game angry their team is at fault for draft issues while proud of their own pick. Already they have created an implicit mental entitlement: their pick is better so theyre the better player But once the horn sounds because they arent that great on positioning with SWM they spend literally the entire game dying to duel hook and vortex with no hope of ever accomplishing anything that they set out to do.  Rather than accept their decision might not have been optimal because *after all they picked the best counter to enemy lineup* they open a mic channel and demand their team do a better job of succeeding for them.  They rage that Drow was a poor pick (in fairness it is but crucially they saw it coming before their own pick and could have picked a better complement). Never mind that they picked the SWM into an allied team that could have used a better disabling support and 3 excellent burst gank heroes. The game ends in a loss and they console themselves by [refreshing their counterpicking website which supports their SWM choice]( http://dotapicker.com/herocounter#!/E_Storm_Spirit/E_Legion_Commander/E_Pudge/T_Faceless_Void) and saying well it couldnt have been my fault then I picked the right hero my allies must have played the game wrong.  &nbsp;  This is an absolutely abysmal way to play Dota and for some reason I have seen it *constantly* recently. Every game there is someone on microphone from pre horn to game end letting all 4 of the rest of us know just how wrong were playing compared to the choices they would have made.  Sometimes they have the right idea most times theyre idiots. But no matter if theyre technically correct or not they inevitably tilt themselves or their allies with the constant stream of commentary and criticism. They disrupt and discourage needed tactical communication and often get muted and become useless to the team.  #The Solution: Adaptive Mental Posture (AMP)  Being AMPed (Adaptively Mentally PosturED) refocuses your mental game on the one thing you control yourself.  Its also conveniently the reverse acronym from PMAtotally a coincidence though.  Getting AMPed up can be described by the following principles:  1\. AMPed players **Assume allies are equals even if their playstyle is badly misaligned with their own.**  Adaptive players understand that equal MMR means equal overall skill but that that there are so many different skillsets in dota that every game requires a fresh analysis of each player in the game.  They do not overestimate their skill or ability to plan strategic choices compared to their allies; instead they analyze each game from a neutral perspective that starts from the assumption that all 10 players are about as good as their MMR should indicate (respective large MMR differential games and party MMR games).  2a\. AMPed players **Seek to identify and take advantage of more mistakes than their opponent can of them** which is the core definition of being better at Dota than your opponent.  Whether in positioning itemization or game pace Adaptive players actively understand how each game and player has a unique mix of aggression defense and opportunity based on the strengths and weaknesses of their allies and enemies. Each game presents a unique mix of opportunity and threat not a blanket set of rules from game to game.   2b\. Conversely AMPed Players **always seek the advantage in teammate decisions they disagree with.** A Lion may farm aghs or 2 allies may die pushing stupidly; this is not an opportunity to convince them of your supposed superiority but to capitalize on what they did do whether thats simply to create space to take advantage of or to delay the game for an unnecessary but still usable itemization advantage.   3\. AMPed players **lead by example particularly by minimizing foreseeable deaths** while farming warding positioning before teamfights and initiating. The Adaptive player should ideally never be picked off because they should constantly be mindful of enemy capability and adapt their movements to avoid obvious enemy threats. Adaptive players do not initiate first and check minimap for allied support second; they always make a decision based on the actual actions of their team not what they want them to be.  4\. AMPed players **never rely on their teammates to follow a preconceived game plan for roles draft and game pace.**  They understand that guides pro meta and Dota theory are guidelines for good play not team rules followed in every pub.  Instead they mitigate team weaknesses and augment strengths by adapting to the reality of each game.  They apply their knowledge to make light suggestions and gain individual advantage.  5\. AMPed players **do not attempt to continuously dictate strategic direction or ongoing critique of teammates recognizing that it is impossible to teach anyone in a single game.** Instead AMPed players focus on their own play and understanding how to fit their gameplay in to suboptimal choices by their allies.  Allied mistakes perceived or actual should be taken as a simple picture of game state not a value judgement.  6a\. AMPed players **understand why hero pool is important** as timings itemization and game adaptations become much more readily apparent when hero familiarity is a given. They have a pool of high medium and low familiarity picks which cover at least 2 roles with multiple subroles.  6b\. AMPed players **do not attempt to force hero or role choices on allies because they recognize that allies may not have that hero or role in their pool** and do not pick unfamiliar heroes solely to counter enemy picks.  7\. AMPed players SDOP their enemies during draft: **Sustain Disable Outdamage Push is the mantra of draft priority in public matchmaking.** Utility heroes with good farm potential which can buy a wide range of team-fighting items (which often enable sustain disable and push) are valued to fill critical gaps in drafts.  8\. AMPed players **communicate in short tactical bursts when decision points are critical.**  Item timings suggested objectives or items warnings about impending initiation and cooldown/mana/hp are key informational points for teammates. Idle strategic assessment musings and critical comments to teammates simply serve to distract from attention to game state. *If a tactical decision is ignored by the team the Adaptive player modifies their plan to accommodate the choice made by the team/ally and does not press the issue.*  9\. AMPed players **concentrate fully on the best choices they can make for THEIR hero not what others should be doing.**  Have a plan for core items and understand the difference between core+situational items. Dont outplay yourself by neglecting a core item on a carry just to counter an enemy team.  Adaptive players only rarely recommend item purchases to team and do so only once or twice to communicate intent.  10\. AMPed players **shut up and play the game the best they can.** They respond only to tactical requirements and lighthearted banter.  Adaptive players maximize use of quick chat options like the chat wheel and alt and ctrl-alt pings to minimize time spent communicating and maximizing time spent concentrating on game state.  &nbsp;  Once you **get AMPed** You will focus primarily on making the best decisions for your own draft pick and playstyle concentrating on identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each team you are placed with and against and molding your own decisions to capitalize on bad enemy decisions and all allied decisions regardless of whether they fit in to a preconceived game framework.  *Realize that it is not possible to mold your teammates ideas of Dota to yours nor do you have any authority or special skill to do so in the duration of the draft or one game of Dota.* Any attempt to do more than give simple suggestions or provide tactical communication is a waste of effort and attention that you could be putting in to playing your own hero better.  In short no matter the insane decisions of your team or the enemy your mental state will be not to inform force or deny those choices but to constantly update your mental understanding of the game you're currently playing to capitalize on the game state in any way you can: by doing this you avoid the tilting confrontations of ""PMA inspired"" team captaining and instead learn that the real way to win is by simply playing through these issues in the best way **you** can.  &nbsp;  **Get AMPed to win.**  #Afterword: Signs you may need to get AMPed and principles to address your weaknesses  Ways your mental state hurts you | AMP Principles to consider | Explanation :--|:-:|:--                                   My team is Peruvian/Russian/Turkish/Pinoy/Redditors/Etc. | (2ab) (4) (5) (6b) (9) | Look I get it but the whole point of this system is to make you focus on working *around* people with different playstyles not trying to change them.

It is your job to adapt to and augment decisions whether they are in line with your idea of proper dota or not You often focus on perceived bad strategic choices (gank vs. push itemization) regardless of the current KDA/GPM of the player or disregard the possible benefits of their choice | (2b) (4) (9) | Just because Bloodseeker went brown boots into dagon hes still 5-0 which means that enemies spent a lot of time dying not pressuring you did you take advantage of that time to get ahead or did you just complain about the Dagon?

You often incorrectly over-apply knowledge to the wrong situation | (2) (6a) (7) | Some players over adapt to be clever such as a core running brown boots -> MKB just because of an enemy PA or counter drafting on unfamiliar heroes because of a website recommendation. Understanding why core items are core to a hero and your own limits in skill and hero pool vastly mitigate this risk. You often believe that the choices of your allies lost the game and more specifically that it would have been a victory had they just listened to you | (1) (2b) (3) (4) (5) (6b) (8) (9) (10) | Fundamental to AMP is understanding that there are many situations where players claim the fault lies with their allies not helping but simply aligning yourself to the games pacing instead of forcing your own pace on it would have solved the problem right away.

"Situational Warding: Ward for what you need not just in ""good"" spots.",self.DotA2,"Edit:  Updated with pictures by popular demand.  Credit to ()_NeOn_GeNeSis_ for his Steam guide which I lifted from heavily.  Again my picture references are not an exhaustive list...just the most obvious wards for what I'm talking about.  ...  As someone who just about exclusively supports I wanted to give a little perspective on warding that I feel most folks are missing even at high levels (5K+).  Warding isn't just about knowing where ""good"" ward spots are.  There are dozens of maps and videos you can watch that will show you where all the spots are that give you optimal vision of various things...~~I won't be covering that~~ Common examples included below.  [THIS is an exhaustive list however](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=358789918).  Instead I want to highlight WHY you should choose a specific ward position based on what's going on in the game.  I'll break these down into specific ward categories:  **Rosh Ward** **Objective Ward** (Offensive/Defensive) **Jungle Ward** (Offensive/Defensive) **Lane Ward** and **Mid Ward**.  Even these aren't ALL the reasons you'd want to ward but it should give you a really solid foundation to build upon if you're still the person who just wards the runes for 30 minutes and maybe the designated ward spots when you have the appropriate map control.  **Rosh Ward**  First things first your Rosh ward should just about always give you rune vision so this is a high priority ward location.  There are really only 4 spots to ward that give this vision appropriately (2 on Dire 2 on Radiant) so dewarding is fairly straightforward.  If they have a ward there a pair of sentries WILL find them.  Radiant Side 2:  [Here](http://imgur.com/bZqbkjW) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/LJAwYwm.jpg).  One sentry can hit both of these.  Dire Side 2:  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/wiQD5dL.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/VdEwj4j.jpg).  One sentry can hit both of these.  There are secondary locations that can scout Rosh but they are rarely used (even at high levels).  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/5qlgk7w.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/jcXf4T3.jpg).  This last ward of course is used all the time...just not to scout Rosh and usually not past 15 minutes.  Good times for this ward:  * Enemy has an early Rosh hero (8-12 minutes for folks like Troll/Ursa/Lycan) * When you know Rosh is spawning you want a ward here  ...in general this is a very high priority ward spot.  If you're completely unsure of where to ward this is always a safe bet.  **Mid Ward**  This ward is meant to be placed uphill on the enemy side of the river (ideally) to give you better vision on the mid.  You can place this either immediately uphill in the middle of the lane or just on the uphill outside edges of mid that still give you vision of mid.  [Like this](http://imgur.com/WccJBK9) or [like this](http://i.imgur.com/tx8pwRQ.jpg) (opposite for other side).  This same ward is also a good objective ward for mid tower but I'll cover that in a sec.  Good times for this ward:  * When you need uphill vision to establish if it's safe to gank or allow a gank setup (SB charge execute Axe blink etc etc). * When your mid is constantly getting rotated on by the other team's jungler or supports through mid.  **Objective Warding**  These wards are meant to give you an advantage when your team is pressing an objective (Tower/Rax).  Instead of blindly pushing a tower and rolling the dice on who's around to defend you can spend a ward to give you a much better chance to knock that objective down.  You'll be placing these wards in spots that at least give you vision of any potential TPs to that tower.  Generally this is behind the Bot/Top T1s ([like this](http://i.imgur.com/rQUJi6F.jpg)) or some high ground location at the T2s ([like this](http://i.imgur.com/UkO6o5F.jpg) or [like this](http://i.imgur.com/UgESVmy.jpg)).  You may also want to ward the path TO that tower if you're more worried about roaming rotations vs. TPs.  These are more typically mid-game wards vs. early game.  Unsure if it's well known (it should be) but you can ward inside the enemy base from the outside [like this](http://i.imgur.com/OPw2IbW.jpg).  Good times for this ward:  * If you're not sure where the enemy is and it's a risky tower push * If you think there is going to be a teamfight to help setup initiation or scout enemy initiators * Everytime you're pushing rax and know a teamfight will breakout  This applies both offensively and defensively.  If you're getting pushed and you want to prioritize keeping that objective you'll want to do these same wards for the opposite reasons (seeing who's pushing scouting initiation).  **Lane Ward**  This ward is placed between objectives but most commonly refers to a ward placed between your T1 and the enemy T1 towers close to their T1 where you could see rotations/TPs.  This is basically your safety net for your safelane carry to ensure they can farm safely if you aren't there or quickly flee if they see a rotation coming.  It looks [like this](http://imgur.com/Gf6qcZn) or [like this](http://i.imgur.com/87vPp8q.jpg)  Good times for this ward:  * Your lane is ""won"" for the carry (they can farm safely without you) and you're now roaming full time. * Your lane is heavily contested and you need to scout TP rotations  **Jungle Ward**  Defensively these are your ""get map control back"" wards.  Offensively these are your ""gank setup"" or ""where the hell is that jungle farming hero"" ward.  This isn't the ""block camps"" type of ward that I'm talking about.  This is placing a ward in the jungle at a chokepoint somewhere where you'll be able to see if the enemy is farming their jungle or rotating through it.  Main Dire Spots:  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/pyISiml.jpg) and [Here](http://i.imgur.com/GG2LhVi.jpg)  Main Radiant Spots:  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/nYMIG48.jpg) and [Here](http://i.imgur.com/D38wTUz.jpg)  Good times for this ward:  * (Defensive) You need to establish map control of your own jungle to safely farm it * (Offensive) You want to setup ganks and know when it's safe to roam through their jungle to do it  **Quick Note on Dewarding**  I'll just quickly say that dewarding is just as much art as it is science.  You need to figure out what kind of support you're dealing with on the other side.  You also need to be able to read enemy movements to determine if they're reacting ""funny"" to what you're doing.  * Are they very basic in where they place them? * Do they ward like someone who could have written this guide?  If you can easily deward the enemy do it.  If you're constantly getting dewarded immediately get more creative with your ward positioning.  It's better to have SOME vision in less ideal places than no vision because you're constantly dewarded.  **Wrap-Up**  In general your priorities at different points in the game would be:  * Early Game:  Rune Ward Mid Ward Lane Ward * Mid/Late Game:  Rosh Ward Objective Ward Jungle Ward  ...  Again not fully exhaustive of all the reasons/ways you should be warding but I wanted to at least attempt to give people a more situational philosophy of warding.  Even if you don't fully understand or don't see all the reasons you'd expect for the wards I call out...the main point I'm making here is that your wards shouldn't be used casually or carelessly.  They should be placed with a very specific purpose in mind as they are a limited asset.  Hopefully this helps someone or starts a good dialogue.  Cheers!",article

An analysis of ambulatory patterns in DotA2: do bipedal heroes have an inherent advantage over those that do not use two legs to walk?,self.DotA2,Hey Everyone  If any of y'all are like me then you will no doubt be familiar with that all-too-disturbing feeling of uncertainty on the picking screen.  So many options who to pick? At times like these I try to think of what hero might give me the advantage. I recognized that there is a  noted disparity between two groups of heroes; ones that are bipedals and ones that are not. This posed the obvious question; do heroes  that walk on two legs have an advantage over those that walk on four float or otherwise do not exhibit bipedalism? So I crunched the  numbers and without any further ado let's take a look at them.  In the below table you will see three groups of heroes compared: 1) Bipedal heroes 2) Non-bipedal heroes and 3) All 108 heroes. It is  worth noting that non-bipedalism is defined as heroes that do not normally walk on two legs; this includes any heroes that might walk on  greater than two legs use arms for assistance float flow or any other instance in which typical bipedalism is not observed. The table  lists the number of heroes that are bipedal or not out of the total 108 followed by the corresponding range of win percentages average  win percentages and median win percentages for each group. All data was taken from all time statistics on dotabuff.com   Type of Hero | Number of Heroes | Range of Win Percentage | Average Win Percentage | Median Win Percentage 				 ---------|----------|----------|---------|---------|				 Bipedal | 64 | 38.82%-56.74% | 48.90% | 49.00% | 				 Non-bipedal | 44 | 41.26%-56.76% | 48.70% | 48.70% 				 All Heroes | 108 | 38.82%-56.76% | 48.84% | 48.97%	   As the data plainly show **there is no significant difference in average or median win percentage between bipedal and non-bipedal heroes**.  There is only a 0.2% difference in average win percentage between bipedals and non-bipedals and a 0.3% difference between median win  percentages. Thus when trying to pick between 108 heroes there is no reason to consider a bipedal or non-bipedal hero preferentially  over the other.   But what about the most successful heroes in the game? Let's look at the numbers for heroes that have a greater than 50% win rate. Below  heroes that win a majority of all games played were examined from each group. There were 42 total heroes that met this criteria and the  percentages of bipedal and non-bipedal heroes that made up these 42 were calculated and compared to their corresponding percentages out  of all 108 heroes.   Type of Hero | Number of Heroes | Percentage of Heroes with >50% Win-rate | Percentage out of all 108 heroes		 ---------|----------|----------|----------|	 Bipedal | 25 | 59.95% | 59.3%		 Non-bipedal | 17 | 40.05% | 40.7%	   Here it is apparent that **there is no strong correlation between moving on two legs or not and being a hero that has a greater than 50%  win rate**. 59.95 percent of heroes that win >50% of games are bipedals which matches nearly to the 59.3% of all 108 heroes that are  bipedals. Similarly 40.5% of the >50% win rate heroes were non-bipedals which mirrors the 40.7% non-bipedalism seen amongst all heroes.  Overall I conclude that **there is no significant difference in win rates or overall success of a hero (as determined by having >50% win  rate) between those that move on two legs and those that do not**. Therefore there is no reason to be discouraged by the ambulatory  patterns of a hero when debating picks. Thank you for reading and I hope this helps.  TL:DR; It doesn't matter if you pick a hero that walks on two legs four legs floats flows or scutters their method of movement should not have an effect on the outcome of your game.,article

Next Hero EASTER EGG in 7.00? Seems like it!,self.DotA2,"Hey Reddit. It's been less than 24 hours since new patch has been released and I already found an easter egg and major chain of links of what the next hero can be. If you open the ""Legend of the Monkey King"" comic book (located in /700/monkeyking) to the part where MK gets on trial of ""Spirit Brothers"" you may see familiar three spirits (Raijin Kaolin and Xin) and one extra Spirit Brother that we don't know.  Link to that page> http://imgur.com/a/8prSA The 4th Brother has the same head shape and eyes as Ember Spirit and Earth Spirit have meaning that it can't be Brewmaster or any existing hero from Dota 2. Also 4th Brother possess a dark blue almost indigo colour (Very similar to what Enigma has) and his leg area on the second picture of comic page seems to be the most calm and cloak-like. All in all this 4th Brother can be Suijin - the God of Water in Japanese mythology. And here's why he can be the next hero: - If you look on the Arcana of Monkey King you may find that he basically has been interacting with 4 Elements during his story in a comic book: The first form ""Timeless Tale"" states that MK was born from a rock (Earth Spirit). Then he finds his iconic weapon inside the seas (Water Spirit). Then he fights Razor inside the Narrow Maze and it seems a bit farfetched but Razor is made of Electricity (Storm Spirit). Finally MK burns inside the furnace of Ember Spirit.  So his second Arcana form of ""Rumble in the Deep"" possess exact the same colour effect of dark blue and indigo as 4th Brother has. Knowing of how much Valve love to leave us some clues on the next hero in pictures (like Skywrath Mage silhouette on Bristleback patch release) or cosmetics I think this can be pretty good guess.

An analysis of verbal abuse in DotA2: is it helpful to call your teammate a bitch all game? New research suggests maybe.,self.DotA2,TL;DR: Research suggests Goldilocks zone of bullying but doesn't advocate it.  While all of us at some point in our DotA2 histories (and possibly as recently as the last time you played) have experienced some form of verbal abuse there is little research available as to the effects bullying has on overall game outcomes.  Short term effects of verbal abuse are often limited to post-game reactions such as reporting the offending player or blocking subsequent communications with them.  **The purpose of this study is to explore and define how verbal abuse of one player affects that players efficiency during the course of the bullying and also how overall game outcomes (i.e wins and losses) are impacted by this harassment.** Thus I propose the following two aims:  **Aim 1)** Hypothesis:  A reverse correlation exists between the amount of bullying a player receives and their in-game performance metrics; such that the more a player is bullied the worse their overall play will be. To this end 500 match replays and chat logs will be parsed in which one player is undergoing varying levels of verbal abuse from one teammate.  Changes to gold and experience per minute of the victim over the course of the harassment will be compared to normalized control games.  To determine the ultimate effect on game outcome wins and losses will be tabulated based on the severity of the abuse and compared between severities and to a no-abuse control group.  **Aim 2)** Using the data generated in Aim 1 our research group will attempt to replicate the results observed from that retrospective analysis in an *in silico* experimental setting.  Thus over the course of a game one player will be randomly chosen and harassed throughout at varying levels of severity to confirm the impacts on in-game statistics and outcomes.  Additionally we will test whether or not a piling-on effect in which multiple teammates criticize the same player further affects the victim.   We hypothesize there will be an additive effect to the impacts observed in Aim 1 based on increasing harassment load.  To complete Aim 1 as stated above we collected 500 total replays; 100 each for 5 separate players. For every replay we counted the instances of verbal abuse that player received in game.  The resulting gold (GPM) and experience (XPM) rates at the end of the abuse matches could then be compared to a control subset of games in which the player was not verbally abused on the same hero.  In the graphs below all values are normalized to that of a control data set for each player.  In other words setting GPM and XPM to a value of a 1.0 and then comparing the change to each rate based on the instances of verbal abuse received by that player averaged across their 100 games.  Win rate is also included as a third metric.    [As seen in the graphs here](http://imgur.com/a/dUDvY) a surprising trend was apparent between all 5 players.  As expected as the incidents of harassment per game increased the overall efficiency of a player in game (as measured by GPM and XPM) decreased with variable gradualness or rapidness based on the player.  Additionally the corresponding win rates dropped when compared to control games.  Unexpectedly however this decrease reached its low point at 7 incidents of harassment.  **Instead of continuing to worsen the trend reversed itself as all 5 players metrics increased (again at variable rates) when exposed to 8 9 and 10+ incidents of harassment per game.**  Of note comparison of GPM XPM and win rate metrics at 7 incidents of harassment to both control levels and 10+ incident levels yielded statistically significant changes (p<0.001).  To explain this surprising trend we theorize verbally abused players reach a critical point at 7-8 incidents which we are coining the fuck it point.  Up until and including the seventh incident play suffers.  However once that eighth ninth and even tenth disparaging comment comes their way players seem to be driven by a strong desire to prove their bully wrong which leads to incredible levels of performance exceeding normal play ultimately resulting in higher than expected win frequencies.    To complete Aim 2 we sought to confirm the above findings by submitting 10 random players to each level of verbal harassment (1-10) as we believe the trends above seem to suggest a universal pattern in DotA2 players.  To this end one player was picked in each of the 100 total games and verbally assaulted anywhere from 1 to 10 times.  A non-exhaustive list of insults is compiled in the below table for example.      Example| Insults| Seen| Here ---|---|----|---- This [abused hero name]| WTF [abused hero name]| Holy shit [abused player color] is bad| Spamming >Well played and pinging the site at which abused player made a questionable play Fucking [implied negative national/racial/ethnic term] [abused hero name]| Sarcastically noting the poor timing of a purchased item| Useless [abused hero name]| Comment on poor overall score (i.e 0-7 [abused hero name]) We lost because of [abused hero color]| DO SOMETHING [abused hero name]| You a little bitch [abused hero color]| Hey why dont you fucking play better [abused hero name] Uninstall [abused hero color]| Go back to League [abused hero name]| I think [abused hero color] is just an ape strapped into a chair pounding on a keyboard|  It would be better if [abused hero color] was just an ape strapped into a chair pounding on a keyboard You got shit on in lane [abused hero name] now were fucked| Nice game [abused hero name who is not having a nice game] you shit-stain| GG END [abused hero color] SUCKS| jajajajaja [abused hero name]  As expected our results from this experimental set-up y[ielded very similar data to the above graphs in Aim 1 (first graph here)](http://imgur.com/a/zpDGL).  Indeed players performance declined when receiving up to 7 instances of harassment though the players who received 8 or more showed marked improvements to GPM and XPM metrics which were most improved upon at 10 harassing comments (see aggregate results in first graph here).  We then hypothesized if more two teammates singled out and abused the same player rates may decline more quickly at lower instances of harassment but could show even greater improvement at peak levels of abuse.  To test this theory we repeated our initial experiment described above but instead of one person doing all the harassing 2-4 teammates would all harass the same player from 1 to 10 times each (for example; if 2 teammates are testing for 5 negative comments each player would say 5 negative things a total of 10 said to the abused player).    As we anticipated the addition of extra teammates harassing the abused player decreased their performance in a dose-dependent manner (more abusers = worse metrics).  [However there was no observed improvement in play with 8 more instances of abuse; indeed there was further decline which was most severe in the most extreme bullying case \(4 teammates piling on the other 1 (last three graphs)](http://imgur.com/a/zpDGL).  It is possible the fuck it point does not apply when more than one person is being critical towards a player.  The abused player may feel overwhelmed when two people are verbally assaulting them and the same motivation to prove them wrong perhaps is overpowered by self-doubt or anger.  **It is therefore of importance to not assign one player as the team scapegoat.  While venting team frustration at one player may be easy and feel good it is detrimental to play and likelihood of match success.**  In conclusion the authors of this seminal study must stress that we do not condone communication abuse in game.  We believe the best case scenario for everyone involved is to not engage in any form of harassment.  However if you find yourself unable to resist we strongly suggest that you do so with knowledge of our findings here.  The last thing you want is to only harass that shitty Tusk seven times; youre ruining his play and your chances to win.  If you had just told him to fuck himself one two even three more times that Tusk could have turned your game around and youd find yourself on the winning end of a DotA2 game.

Not sure if you should buy the Compendium?,self.DotA2,Are you about to make a post whether or not you should buy a Compendium or you just want a little convincing?  Well the answer is: Yes. Why?  * You're investing and assisting in the growth in eSports. The prize pool started out at $1600000 then reached $2900000 last year via the Compendium. This year in 4 days we're currently sitting at near $4500000 which is insane.  * Immortal treasures which the higher your compendium level is the more you receive you will be able to sell on the marketplace and get your small $10 fee back very quickly even if they're selling for $2 each. * An insane battle bonus which assists you in levelling super quickly resulting in an item every ~2-3 games. Who knows you could get lucky with an Arcana drop.  * You get to vote in the hero who receives the next arcana and you may either discover your new favourite hero or get lucky with your already favourite hero winning. * You're contributing to the stretch goals and at this rate Valve will have to release additional ones. The ones we have reached already are fantastic and I do not doubt we'll pass $6000000 by the end of July. * Plus you'll get 2 couriers with alternative skins and a load of other cool stuff.  * Oh and did I mention that the $6000000 goal is base customization? That's right; HATS for your BASE. You love hats otherwise you wouldn't be playing a Valve game.  You have until the end of July to come up with $10. That's 10 weeks. That's $1 a week. Will you miss that $1 each week?   Still not sure? How much is a movie? In Australia an adult movie ticket is $17-$20 which lasts on average 90-120 minutes. How long does a match of DotA go for? Average 30minutes. How many games have you played? Exactly.  TL;DR - Yes go buy one right now and may the DotA gods favour you.  http://www.dota2.com/international/compendium/,article

Terrorblade Lore as analysed by a lit major,self.DotA2,"TL;DR: Terrorblade is the hero equivalent of that awful Papa Roach song. He's really edgy.  Good writing and character design is achieved by the use and occasional subversion of a set of writing conventions. Terrorblade is no exception to this; he's actually one of the better-written of the cast. Certainly better than Tiny whose entire identity seems to revolve around a series of rock puns.  Terrorblade is constructed around two interrelated themes. In this essay I shall address each separately highlighting how these themes manifest in his biography voice responses visuals and ability effects and then I shall link them together and explain how they work in tandem to create the character of Terrorblade. I am doing this in spite of having five major essays due in the next two weeks. Please send help.  The first of the two themes evident throughout Terrorblade's characterisation is that of mirrors. This theme is endemic in all illusion-based heroes with the exception of Spectre and Chaos Knight; Terrorblade however takes this theme a step further than them. Whereas the idea of mirrors is a secondary theme in someone like Morphling whose primary character focus is on (unsurprisingly) shapeshifting morphing and deception Terrorblade uses mirrors as his primary thematic motif. Sentenced to Foulfell Terrorblade was forced to ""gaze eternally into the twisted reflection of their [sic] own soul"". Foulfell has appeared before this; Wraith Night had Foulfell Shards which appeared graphically as mirror fragments thus leading to the popular depiction of Foulfell as a fractal demonic mirror dimension. Terrorblade also ""ruled in the hell of Foulfell"" and ""made himself master of his own reflected worst self"". Clearly mirrors play an important part in his backstory and his powers demonstrated in-game stem from the manipulation of reflections and mirrors. Reflection forces enemies to gaze into their own worst selves; Conjure Image summons a fractal fragmented and imperfect mirror self of Terrorblade; and Metamorphosis shows him metaphorically shattering the mirror entirely and assuming his full terrible power (as per the description of his arcana). Sunder is the least thematically relevant of all his abilities and will have its own mention later on in this work in relation to secondary themes.  Visually Terrorblade also utilises this mirror theme especially with the arcana. Aside from the obvious Reflection and Conjure Image Terrorblade's physical form is composed of jagged plates that reflect light (with shadows turned on in game settings and the arcana equipped). His armour appears to be at least partially *made* of some mirror-like substance - what is under that armour or if that armour is actually his body is unknown. Furthermore his arcana provides a custom death animation for those he kills which from a distance mimics someone puckering up into their own asshole. However when examined more closely the animation shows the victim shattering much akin to a mirror and their life essence being consumed by Terrorblade (see secondary themes). Although this effect is reliant on the arcana it serves to highlight the visual nature of Terrorblade's primary thematic elements alongside that of his abilities.  The second primary theme Terrorblade possesses works with the first to generate interest in the character. This theme is ""fear"" and is equally as obvious as mirrors are - it is quite literally a part of his name. The purpose of Foulfell's punishment is obviously intended to elicit a reaction of terror and denial of their worst selves from its inmates; Terrorblade's shattering of its fractal walls is symbolic of his assuming complete power over fear something he quite obviously delights in. His voice lines make this evident - ""fear what you will never understand"" ""quiver and quail"" ""the wise flee my footfalls"" ""fear comes for you"" ""they cannot hide"". I could go on but I believe the point has been made.  Yet this is somewhat ironic as Terrorblade's punishment still lingers within him as his metamorphosed form - his power over fear comes from his *being* afraid of himself and the intimate knowledge this terror brings him. One of his lines for using Metamorphosis is ""Ahm'sol miskath ozh"" a line in Ozkavosh that translates to ""All hope fails me."" Terrorblade and Metamorphosis Terrorblade are two distinct personalities - the Meta Terrorblade is decidedly more violent cruel and downright evil delighting in his monstrous power (Eyik ozh poz!) whereas Terrorblade is more prideful and underhanded and with more emphasis on mischief and rogue-like behaviour as opposed to brute force carnage (My aggrandizement increases!).  His abilities as with the theme of mirrors serve to act as vessels to convey the theme of fear. Reflection by creating a 'worst self' of enemies incites and spreads the same fear that Terrorblade himself feels. Although I freely admit this next point is a stretch the split-pushing capabilities of Terrorblade can also be seen as a thematic application of his work to ""turn his terror loose upon all creation"".  These two themes work together; the mirror is the source of Terrorblade's power and fear is the manifestation of that power. The blending of these themes is most apparent in Metamorphosis; as I explained Terrorblade fears his worst self reflected back at him but that fear grants him power over the fear of others. His fear of his own self although not explicitly stated is the primary character drive for Terrorblade; he is as much a victim of himself as he is the perpetrator. Others being susceptible to fear grants him power; hence his rivalry with Timbersaw who as the leafy lumberjack Batman is somewhat immune to the terror Terrorblade inflicts.  The character also has a couple of secondary themes. The first of these is thieving; Terrorblade was imprisoned for his thievery and upon breaking out of Foulfell retained his status as a ""cosmic iconoclast"". Sunder is the primary manifestation of this theme stealing the enemy's life force; his arcana kill animation also shows him stealing the life force from his slain foes. This is relegated to a secondary motif as it is not as endemic in his design; Terrorblade as a thief is a remnant of his pre-Foulfell self that he clings to in order to differentiate himself from the brutal sadism of Meta Terrorblade. The second of these lesser themes is rage or wrath; this motif manifests itself in Metamorphosis where ""the rage rises up and takes control"". Terrorblade also references his rage in his responses - ""all anger ends in cruelty"" ""the hunter demon rages"". Rage is a character trait of Meta Terrorblade that is used as a weapon of terror.  Despite the copious edgelord appearance the character of Terrorblade is considerably deeper than first appearances dictate. I've not covered every aspect of his personality and interactions; such an effort would take far more time than I have already. Nevertheless analysis of motifs can be applied to any hero in the game to reveal the construction of their character.",article

Three Years of OpenDota 2017 Financial Report and Organizational Changes,blog.opendota.com,,article
The Art of Drafting,self.DotA2,Drafting has always been an integral part in competitive Dota 2 matches. A Dota 2 match doesnt start when the horn blows neither does it start when 10 heroes spawn in both fountains. It starts at the drafting page where either captain tries to outsmart the other. 30 seconds per ban/pick and 130 seconds of reserve time is all each team gets to decide the 5 heroes they want to play and removing 5 from their opponents pool. It might seem like a lot of time but for those that have experience drafting somehow these seconds slipped by faster than one would hope for. The art of drafting is something far more complex than any human mind can comprehend and even the best minds in the world such as Kuroky Puppey or PPD can get out-drafted by others. There are probably tens or hundreds of thoughts going through the captains mind at each point in the draft - What if they pick X hero? Are we ready for it?; Should I ban X or Y hero?; Should I deny pick them or stick with what we are comfortable?; Will they cheese us?; the list goes on. Breaking down all these thought processes will be impossible due to its endless possibilities. Instead let us look at the different approaches teams tend to undertake when drafting.  **Proactive vs Reactive**  Teams can either be proactive or reactive when drafting. Being proactive means that you go into the draft with a strategy or a specific playstyle in mind picking heroes that suit your strategy with your opponent picks having minimal impact on your draft. On the contrary being reactive simply means to react to whatever your opponent picks and counter them. Of course both approaches have its pros and cons and there are no right or wrong in either approach. Imagine a scale from 1-100 (with 1 being 100% proactive and 100 being 100% reactive) it depends entirely on the team (or captain) which point on the scale they (or he) would like to be on.  A good example of a proactive team would be the current iteration of NaVi. They tend to go for their comfort picks (i.e. Sonneikos Disruptor Rodgers Enchantress Crystallizes Faceless Void Dendis Lina Generals Clockwork) playing the game in their comfort zone and forcing their opponents to play at their tempo. Pros? A familiar lineup that allows everyone on the team to be on the same page. This is probably a huge factor in NaVi finding early success at the start of the season qualifying for both the StarLadder and PGL minors. The downside? They can be quite predictable and easily countered.  This is why the best captains in the world are able to balance this scale knowing exactly when to be proactive or reactive. Theres no better example than Liquid.Kuroky at TI7. In the Lower Bracket series against LGD Kuroky expected the Chinese to go for the Magnus for eLeVeN in game 1. As such he was ready for it and reacted accordingly resulting in a massive out-draft. Kuroky immediately switched things up in game 2 taking a more proactive approach. He went for the Dazzle-Huskar duo as well as Broodmother and forced LGD to have an answer for it.  There are scenarios where a certain team understands the meta better than everyone else. As such they are able to be more proactive in their approach and this forces their opponents to react. The best example here would be CDEC during TI5. They drafted and played their own style of Dota and none of the teams had an answer up until the Grand Finals where EG.ppd had them figured out. However in the current meta where lane matchups are extremely important the drafting meta is naturally leaning towards the reactive scale. With that said let us look at the different phases of drafting and the various ways of approaching them.  **1st phase bans**  *Proactive* - Removing the strongest heroes in the meta (i.e. Batrider back in the days Troll / Sniper during 6.83 and Leshrac during TI5). As for the current meta heroes such as Nightstalker Lich Natures Prophet Venomancer and Necrophos are all contenders.  *Reactive* - Targeting specific comfort heroes of your opponent. However such an approach usually gives the draft advantage to the team being targeted. Back at TI3 teams were banning Admiral Bulldogs Natures Prophet and Lone Druid in the 1st phase forcing him to play a hero that he is less comfortable on. However this allowed Alliance to get their hands on Io and Naga Siren. Similarly at TI7 teams were targeting GHs Io and Keeper of the Light and this opened up more options for Kuroky in his drafts.  **1st phase picks**  *Proactive* - Drafting a specific strategy. A good example would be picking up Faceless Void + Ancient Apparition right away. It forms a good skeleton to your draft yet at the same time gives away your game plan. (Note: This approach is more common if the team has 2nd pick.)  *Reactive* - Consist of the stronger meta heroes that leaked through the ban phase. As mentioned earlier having favorable lane matchups is extremely important in todays meta as it allows supports to constantly move around the map. As such teams will avoid picking their cores early so as to prevent getting counter-picked. This is why it is rather common to see all four supports being picked in the 1st phase. Another important thing is keeping an open draft. This is the reason why Earthshaker is one of the top 1st pick hero currently. Not only is he one of the strongest position 4 hero in the meta he is also extremely versatile and can be played on multiple roles (2 3 4 5). Having such a hero early on in the draft allows a team to switch things up should the need arise. This was a technique that EG.Cr1t used quite frequently back when he was still drafting for the boys in blue. He would pick core heroes like Puck or Batrider early on in the draft and switch roles if he feels that it has been heavily countered.  **2nd phase bans**  *Proactive* - Removing heroes that counter your lineup. Here are 3 different scenarios each with an example. 1) Lane counters: Banning Weaver / Lifestealer when you have an offlane Batrider. 2) Hero counters: Banning Silencer when you have an Enigma. 3) Strategy counters: Banning Anti-Mage / Morphling when you have a strong wombo-combo lineup that is weak against split-push. The approach to these bans is considered proactive as it is centered around your own draft.  *Reactive* - Firstly you can opt to ban heroes from a certain role which your opponent lacks. For example if your opponent did not pick their position 4 support in the 1st phase you can focus your 2nd phase bans on heroes such as Sand King and Nyx Assassin to further reduce their options. Another alternative would be to focus your bans on heroes that synergizes extremely well with your opponents 1st phase picks (i.e. banning away Silencer when your opponent has Batrider or Legion Commander). Also if your opponent drafted heroes like Natures Prophet + Shadow Shaman in the 1st phase the first thing that comes to mind is a possibility for a deathball push. As such banning heroes like Pugna Dragon Knight or Drow Ranger in the 2nd phase could be an option.  **2nd phase picks**  The 2nd phase is where it gets interesting. As mentioned teams will try to avoid showing their cores unless they already know what they are up against (i.e. picking a carry upon knowing your opponents offlane vice versa). As such depending on how the draft unfolds one team will be forced to show a core hero first. This is also why heroes such as Venomancer and Necrophos are so popular now. They are versatile cores that can be played on multiple roles / lanes and they are extremely strong and self-sustained laners which is really important in the current meta. Despite showing your core early on the versatility of these heroes doesnt fully expose your game plan and will keep your opponents guessing.  *Proactive* - Picking heroes that synergizes with your lineup / strategy (i.e. Picking Visage / Weaver into a Drow Strat) or simply picking strong hero duos such as Dazzle-Huskar or Oracle-Death Prophet.  *Reactive* - This is similar to the proactive section of the 2nd phase bans. Instead of one team banning proactively this would be the other team picking reactively. Here are more examples with the same 3 scenarios: 1) Lane Counter: Picking Oracle into Dark Seer. 2) Hero Counter: Picking Razor into Lifestealer. 3) Strategy Counter: Lets take a trip down memory lane back to TI2 where Puppey was able to draft the perfect counter to the strongest combo back then - Naga Sleep into Dark Seer Vacuum combo. Luminous: Puppey talked about the Naga Counter its LightofHeaven with his BKB. (Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDaJes0T1Ig) to re-live the moment) (Disclaimer: the YouTube video does not belong to me. Credits to the owner of the video.)  **Final ban**  Most of the time (with few exceptions) teams should already know the missing role in the opponents draft. As such the last ban would be solely to target the hero of that specific role/player. For example if it is obvious that the opponent lacks a mid hero the last ban can be one that counters your mid hero (i.e. Silencer against Puck) or simply just a classic hero of the player in question (i.e. Scccs Queen of Pain). Also the last ban could be used to remove a hero that would complete your opponents lineup (i.e. Banning Medusa into a Drow lineup).  **Final pick**  The last pick is usually something that would complete your own draft (proactive) or counter the enemys draft (reactive). It is important to find the balance between having a favorable lane matchup and fitting the hero into your overall game plan. For example NaVi likes to last pick Lina into Faceless Void. Not only is Lina one of Dendis best hero it also synergizes well with FV. Another possible approach would be to spot a weakness in your opponents draft and pick a hero that exploits that weakness. For example picking Broodmother into a lineup that is lacking AOE or a slippery hero like Morphling into a lineup that lacks lockdown. This is usually more effective when you have the ultimate last pick as your opponent is unable to counter that pick.  **Conclusion**  Some captains favor being proactive while others prefer reactive. However it is never a good thing to be too extreme on either ends. What separates the excellent drafters from the good ones is the ability to balance between strategy and counter-picking knowing exactly when to be proactive and when to be reactive even within a single draft itself. Getting a good draft going into the game increases the confidence of the team. I personally believe that the best Dota is played when a team is fearless yet collected; where players feel comfortable making plays in their own capacity while still following the game plan as dictated by the captain.  Drafting is not easy. In fact it is insanely difficult. The level of intricacy going into every pick and ban is enormous. What I have presented here is a simplified way to look at drafting and hopefully upon reading it will help you better understand the drafting phase when watching a competitive game in the future.  - Written by Ehzx.,article
This is why Chinese Dota is dead,self.DotA2,"SanSheng A.K.A. Dog Bro was too poor to even afford to buy a case of cigarettes. He could only spend 1 RMB (about 15 cents) to buy some bulk ones. People always teased him as ""rubbish dog"".  Now when he's streaming the audiences always try to persuade him not to smoke that much. "" Hey Dog bro stop smoking so much you'd get cancer for that!"". He'd say ""Whatever. I'm hopeless on smoking."" and then keep lighting another cigarette about every 15 minutes.    He said when sleeping by the road with Zippo he boasted that ""I'm gonna smoke Zhonghua(one of the best cigarettes in China) everyday when I get rich"". Zippo said ""Fuck you rubbish dog we can only pick the cigarette butts. How the fuck can we have Zhonghua?"" Sansheng smiled and said "" At least let me have a thought about it.""  Right before the finals of TI4 Sansheng smoked half of the cigarette and securities let him put it out telling him that ESPN is live casting and no smoking is allowed. He didn't say anything just forcefully smoked twice and finished the other half of the cigar. Hao asked him ""why insist on that one cigar? We'll at least be the runner up let's get some best cigars when we get back home."" Sansheng responded ""I'm reluctant to waste it. Years ago I spent 0.5 rmb just to buy 2 bulk Jiaozi(a brand of relatively quite cheap cigarettes) and now I'm having the nice American cigars. I may not be able to smoke it tomorrow.""  When Sansheng was talking about this in his stream you can hear his voice trembling. ""Fuck..."" Dog bro said then lighted another cigarette.    ""While we were sleeping on the streets all we wanted is to feed ourselves and to be able to continue playing the game. Win honor for our country? I'm afraid I didn't think that far.

We planned to sleep in the net cafe but we arrived too late and didn't know the exact address of the net cafe so we could only sleep on the street. It was raining we had no choice to hide on the porches.  The next day when I got up I found the quilt already soaking wet.""  ""At that time I was thinking if I can ever get some prizes and get rich someday I'll buy a house for my mom and a car for my sister.""  After winning TI4 someone asked Sansheng why he didn't look at the camera when people were taking pictures of them. He laughed and said ""the trophy is so dazzling that I can't even open my eyes.""

An analysis of UI and map changes in Patch 7.00: how players ocular inefficiencies led to increased pick rates of heroes with more than two eyes,self.DotA2,**TL:DR:** To compensate for their inabilities to adjust to UI and map changes in patch 7.00 players picked heroes with more-than-two-eyes more in the week following patch 7.00 release than the patch/week prior.  Hello everyone  Over the course of my career as a DotA2 analyst the cornerstone of my research has focused on why we pick our heroes.  Rather than go into well-established dogma as to the effectiveness of each hero patch-to-patch or the esoteric arguments of situational need my studies seek to explore a largely unaccounted for niche.  That is *subconsciously* what factors influence our hero selections?  Ive looked at hero attractiveness hero personalities hero teeth genetically modified heroes and all things in between.  Some have argued that this past research has little relevance isnt practical or is simply a waste of timeall points I soundly disagree with.  Be that as it may the recent overhaul to DotA2 via patch 7.00 presents a wonderful opportunity to perhaps break bread with some of my critics.   Patch 7.00 fundamentally changed DotA2 and if the response on community outlets such as this subreddit are any indication players were not prepared for that much change.  While there were many large modifications it is fair to say two stuck out by knocking players out of their comfort zones: user interface (UI) and map changes.  Ultimately change to these once set-in-stone features disoriented and confused many players.  Glancing around the screen for common indicators of a games progression such as creep score health bars hero levels and enemy inventories quickly became an uncomfortable task.  Many players complained of increased eye-movement necessary to glean all of this information some of which they argued was now absent.  The updated map also warranted intensified scrutiny of the screennew paths structures Roshan location and juke spots all needed to be ocularly assessed and filed away into memory.  Taken together players eyes were under some serious strain which begs the question: did this affect how we picked our heroes?  Consciously we were aware that our two eyes were simply not getting the job done when it came to interpreting the new UI and map.  Also consciously many complained to Valve.  However subconsciously **I hypothesize that players attempted to compensate for the inability of their eyes to take in these changes by picking heroes with more-than-two-eyes**.  Therefore I propose that the pick rates of heroes with more-than-two-eyes will be increased in the week following patch 7.00s release.  For this pilot study I first needed to establish a baseline of what a hero with more-than-two-eyes is.  To that end only heroes with more-than-two-eyes present as they spawn into the game were considered.  This includes heroes that have more-than-two-eyes on their faces (Sandking) those with two heads attached to the same body (Ogre Magi) those comprised of multiple individuals (Techies) or those with mounts (two eyes for the rider two eyes for the mount).   Excluded heroes for the purposes of this study include illusion generating (Phantom Lancer) and minion creating heroes (Beastmaster) as primary concern was on eyes present at the start of the match.    To test my hypothesis hero pick rate data was collected from dotabuff.com for the week following patch 7.00 release as well as the week before using an internet archive tool. **An important note**: patch 7.00 pick rate data excludes Monkey King in order to fairly compare the remaining heroes.  Monkey Kings pick rate was obviously high due to his release and I did not want that data affecting the rest of the heroes. In table 1 below heroes that meet the above presented more-than-two-eye criteria are listed along with their pick rates for each week.  The difference between patch 7.00 and pre-patch are shown in the bottom row.      Hero| Mirana| Luna| Ogre Magi| Alchemist| Sand King| Chaos Knight| Jakiro| Techies| Disruptor| KotL| Batrider| Broodmother ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---- Type of eyes| Mount| Mount| Two heads| Mount/Two bodies| Many eyes| Mount| Two heads| Two bodies| Mount| Mount| Mount| Many eyes Patch 7.00 pick rate| 20.89| 13.74| 11.75| 10.77| 8.94| 6.77| 5.39| 5.21| 5.09| 4.51| 3.24| 2.20 Pre-patch 7.00 pick rate| 20.09| 11.26| 10.96| 11.58| 8.55| 5.29| 4.75| 4.25| 5.51| 4.80| 2.96| 2.11 Difference| 0.80| 2.48| 0.79|-0.80 |0.39 |1.48 | 0.64|  0.96| -0.42| -0.29| 0.28| 0.09  As seen above 9/12 more-than-two-eye heroes demonstrated increased pick rates the week after 7.00s release providing strong evidence for an upward trend in more-than-two-eye hero pick rates.  Only 3 did not follow this trend Alchemist Disruptor and Keeper of the Light.  These may be explained by players reluctance to pick elderly heroes likely having poor eyesight (Alchemist and KotL) and awareness that an eyepatch could obstruct vision (Disruptor).    Statistically I chose to test this phenomenon by calculating a Z score for the two population proportions. Table 2 below displays the total number of heroes with more-than-two-eyes picked in each week and also the sum of all heroes picked each week (again Monkey King not included for 7.00).  For 7.00 there is a slight increase in both categories likely attributed to popularity of the new patch.  Overall when comparing the proportions of more-than-two-eye heroes played in each week there is a significant increase in pick rates after patch 7.00.    Table 2| Patch 7.00| Pre-patch 7.00 ---|---|---- More-than-two-eye hero picks| 6992239| 6471613 Sum of all hero picks| 70976730| 70264342 Proportion| 0.099| 0.092 Z Score| 129.7185|  P value| <0.00001| Significant  Finally as a proof of principle the pick rates for a hero without any eyes Faceless Void were studied.  If players were subconsciously picking heroes with more-than-two-eyes to help understand changes to the map and UI then they should also avoid a hero that at best offers no additional help and at worse is a detriment (blindness).  Table 3s data supports this hypothesis as the pick rate for Faceless Void fell by a staggering 2% in the week of patch 7.00.    Table 3| Patch 7.00| Pre-patch 7.00| Difference ---|---|----|---- Faceless Void Pick Rate| 10.5| 12.53| -2.03  In summary this study is the first to date to show how real updates and changes to a game (in the form of patch 7.00) can subconsciously affect how players choose their heroes.  **Statistically in the week following the release of patch 7.00 heroes with more-than-two-eyes were picked at a higher rate than the previous week and patch.**  This suggests an effort by players to compensate for their inability to grasp changes to the UI and map by getting additional sets of eyeballs to help out.  Future work should focus on elements excluded from this study (illusions minions) as well as following the data out over the next few weeks to see if more-than-two-eye hero pick rates fall as players become accustomed to the new patch.

Puppey  TI2 was when for me Na'vi truly won the favor of the community winning hearts but not the tournament. But first a bit of background. Natus Vincere were the winners of the inaugural International in 2011 only dropping a single game against EHOME in the final taking it 3-1 in the Best of five thanks to a winner bracket advantage. After TI Artstyle resigned from Na'vi citing his lack of will to give over his TI winnings to the organisation and left Na'vi under a cloud sadly. Despite the issues Puppey was made captain and Ars-Art was recruited into the side. Na'vi won ESWC against the old enemy EHOME again then went on to win the inaugural Defense against Quantic. Despite Artstyle's departure Na'vi kept on steamrolling the opposition and came into TI2 on a high. TI2 marked the first international at the famous Benaroya Hall in Seattle which would become the stage for TI3 too before the eventual move to KeyArena.  Natus Vincere came in not as favourites however despite the build up to the tournament. The general consensus was that the Chinese teams would reign supreme LGD DK and iG were the 3 big teams from China coming into TI and the pre-tournament predictions seemed to hold true. Na'vi had a terrible day 1 Losing 2-0 to iG only tying with coL and EHOME before a 2-0 loss to Orange ended their day one with a 2-6 score looking destined for the lower bracket. However not for the first time the Na'vi squad would turn around what looked like a lost situation. A 2-0 win in the grudge match versus the Artstyle-Captained Darer squad and a crushing of MTW put Na'vi at 6-6 needing a 2-0 against Hao and Mu's TongFu in the final set of games for the day. In the first game this team created their first truly memorable moment in the international. Everything was fine before the match until they let TongFu pick Naga Siren. Naga Siren at the time was considered the most overpowered hero in the game by many in Benaroya and many watching at home. The Song of the Siren having no castpoint was genuinely absolutely broken. Mixed in with an enormous rip tide AOE and illusions not doing limited tower damage the hero was considered the best in the game by a stretch. Na'vi however picked a draft with PA and Puck looking to win the game before the Naga could come online and boss the entire game. After an even start to the match Na'vi went in for Roshan without vision on TongFu. The sleep came out as Roshan was down to half life with the entire of Natus Vincere trapped in the pit it looked hopeless for the CIS Squad.  ""Puppey will have to turn around for the biggest black hole of his life.""  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a16Wdkic3Q TongFu v Navi  And he did. A vacuum into a four man wall and the black hole on top destroyed TongFu and led to a five man wipe. It was sensational. It was unbelievable. It was Na'vi and they had punched their ticket to the upper bracket.  Na'vi would play the legendary DK Squad with rOtk and burNIng on it in the first game of the upper bracket. A poor laning decision by DK to go aggressive tri-lane in an attempt to keep XBOCT's Anti-Mage down led to the downfall of the DK squad in 25 minutes. In game two however the DK lineup changed to the securing of burNIng's farm his Morphling owning the game alongside LongDD's Nature's Prophet and Na'vi couldn't get the win quick enough leading to DK winning late and taking the second game. As the game 3 draft came up and as the three bans came out from Na'vi and DK there was no Naga. DK instantly locked her in. Naga had only been given away on the main stage once previously by Zenith to coL and TC's Naga Siren easily split pushed and outfought the lineup of Zenith to win the game. Na'vi however had experience of defeating the Naga in the groups against Darer and TongFu but this was DK. DK raced into a lead going agressive into the Natus Vincere jungle to kill Puppey and LightOfHeaven as the sound of the horn echoed in the hall. A Puppey signature jungle Lycan and the hero of the International Dendi on Rubick Na'vi did have a comfortable lineup but could they beat the DK.BurNIng Naga? It looked good. The boys from CIS took an early lead before going on rOtk's offlane enigma top. They pounced on him and with less than 50 health he caught both Dendi and XBOCT in a black hole and took down both of them leading to a Tier one tower being brought down always a good thing against the Anti-Mage lineup of Na'vi. Puppey did sneak a Roshan but DK rotated to bring down the final tier one of Natus Vincere at the 14 minute mark. Small trades ensued with BurNIng and XBOCT getting their farm up until the game went quiet both teams feeling comfortable to clear out the map and push out lanes. DK and BurNIng looked powerful the Naga being massive with a Radiance and Heart in tow at 24 minutes but somehow Na'vi saw this as their own timing. With a Lycan aegis they knocked down the DK tier 3 before there was a response. Until burNIng popped the Song of the Siren looking for the 3-4 Man Black hole which would end this Na'vi resurgence. But something was wrong. There was no grouping there was no good hole Na'vi were spread out perfectly not caught by the song whatsoever. With the song down Na'vi went for it and with what felt like endless sustain DK did all they could to hold their base but as the word ""Rampage!"" filled the cheering hall of fans it was over in a flash.  They would now face iG after their defeat of EG in the winners bracket Semi final and so began possibly the most famous series in the history of DotA. The crowd's cheers echoed as Na'vi walked onto the stage arms aloft cheering on the fan-favourites. But they came out of the booths quicker than anyone could have expected. iG in a masterclass destroyed the defending champions with all tier 2 towers ripped apart by Zhou's Morphling by the 16 Minute mark and with the score at 6-0 Na'vi called it. Were iG really that good? They had just shredded the champions in the only flawless game of the tournament. Na'vi needed something special something miraculous to halt the steam train which was Invictus Gaming in game two.  ""Oh Oh Oh No! Oh god... This could be painful.""  Invictus Gaming got Naga and Darkseer. A combo never given away during the entire of the International until that point. A combination that at the time meant Darkseer could vaccum people in - while they slept - to unleash a brutal combination. LD was right this really could be painful. However Na'vi looked like they had a plan with the third pick of Juggernaut a rarely seen hero at the time alongside the staples of the Dendi Rubick and crucially the LightOfHeaven Enigma. The game looked like it started well for Na'vi but the Naga was farming and the towers weren't falling with a draft including Enchantress and Juggernaut. The game was far too quiet for the liking of Na'vi and after iG dived the Natus Vincere tier one tower to kill Dendi and Ars-Art but as the Ravage and the Song were used they came right back at iG bringing down Ferrari and Zhou in the shadow of the tier two mid of iG. The game went back to being quiet iG farming and getting their levels to complete the Ravage Wall Song combo. Na'vi took down towers while iG avoided the fights. As Na'vi set up to take the final outer tower of iG they smoked up as five. Sneaking through the river creeping behind the Natus Vincere lineup. YYF Surges Zhou into battle with his Song of the Siren online putting the entire of Na'vi under the spell of the Siren. The Darkseer pulled them into the centre of the fight into the dirt path a place which would make a fitting grave for what looked like the entire of Na'vi. The ravage came out but LightOfHeaven hit his Black King Bar in time and performed a miracle. Catching four of iG in the hole with the spinning Juggernaut on top with Dendi's ravage stolen from Faith's Tidehunter to finish off Invictus Gaming wiping them off the map.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La--egn0MrU& iG V Navi  'The Play' had happened before our eyes. Not a play. The play had happened a play that would come to define the competitive scene of DotA 2. The madness of it all. How anything can happen how teams battling for millions to change their lives can come down to miraculous plays and heart-wrenching mistakes. How players are created by their choices when they sit down to play the game. How nothing else matters when you're in it. Winners and Losers The Haves and Have-nots the players who will lift the aegis and the players who will have their heartstrings torn to shreds. From the managers to the fans to the players everyone can feel every little bit of emotion in the game and this is why I love DotA.  Na'vi would go on to take the game two and three and defeat the undefeated LGD team to reach the Grand Final but fell to the vengance-driven Invictus Gaming in the final 3-1 after an epic series. They may not have won the tournament. But the won the hearts of the people watching worldwide. Everybody knows the play in all types of videogames anyone who has watched Esports for a long time they'll tell you what the play was. A play to define DotA. A moment to define Esports.

[META] Leaked documents reveal high profile community members send upvotes to off-shore accounts to avoid downvotes: The Peruvian Papers.,self.DotA2,TL;DR: Rich people avoid downvotes by paying off people over-seas to do it for them. They probably laugh about it behind all your backs too.  This special report strays from usual topics of analysis but we believe this is something the /r/DotA2 community should be aware of.  An anonymous user closely involved with the inner-workings of this sub-reddit recently leaked a trove of data on user karma scores to myself and members of my analysis team.  This leak reveals rampant use of off-shore karma accounts linked to high profile members of the DotA2 community.  To protect their anonymity our sources name has been altered and they will be referred to only as Dannie K..  This report is the first installment of a large-scale investigation which we are terming the Peruvian Papers.   Nearly all of us are familiar with the karmic aspect of Reddit karma.  Some of your posts and comments get upvoted some get ignored and some are downvoted.  After burying our team under thousands of pages of karma reports Dannie K. gave us only one clue:[ look into CIS users who use Christmas Pudge flairs \(aka Santa Pudge\)](https://imgur.com/4esHYTM.png).  This clue would ultimately expose a hidden world of karma-rich users who use off-shore karma safe-havens to avoid downvotes.    We began pouring through the leaked files and indeed found a pattern of Pudge-Santa flaired users from the CIS region who had earned consistent negative karma scores.  Given that exclusively negative karma scores break the previously mentioned karmic balance we sifted through the data to find an explanation for these imbalanced accounts.  What we found shocked us and will force many to reconsider the notion of a perceived fairness in the Reddit voting system.     Large chunks of positive karma were being sent to these CIS Santa-Pudges from off-shore accounts.  These boluses of upvotes remain hidden from users overall karma scores but were found in the sub-reddit meta data.  Tracing the origins of these deposits revealed that they were coming from users with unnatural patterns of posts/comments that are consistently highly upvoted.  Current and former community members such as Nahaz SirActionSlacks Blitz ESPORTSREP and others were found to have wired positive karma to the Santa-Pudges shell-accounts.     What this boils down to is a mutual agreement between two groups trying to avoid karmic imbalance.  High-profile community members whose posts are highly (and unnaturally) upvoted need a source of negative karma for balance.  Thus Nahaz and others use offshore CIS region accounts (Santa-Pudge flairs) to receive a source of negative karma by sending excess positive karma overseas.   In turn Santa-Pudges simply post whatever moronic drivel comes to mind and collect downvotes in proxy for their well-to-do clients.  [See this chart for visual representation.](https://imgur.com/GeunkCh.png)   We sincerely thank Dannie K. for providing this data and note the bravery and moral fortitude they showed in doing so.  We hope the community recognizes the good this kind of whistle-blowing does and look forward to discussions generated by these findings.  Thank you for reading.  ,article
Improving game play: Reporting cheaters in Dota 2,self.DotA2,As you can see more and more players are **cheating** in Dota2. This can be very frustrating to players because of imbalanced gameplay where one player can do the impossible. This is because cheaters are playing with illegal **scripts** and **hacks**(Yes you read it right hacks). These hacks are changing/adding game files called **.lua** files which normally cannot be modified by a legitimate player. Some modifications with the config **.cfg** files are already giving unfair advantage too but that is not our focus this time.   I know that a lot of players already know what the cheat is called but I would rather not mention it here since *innocent players* might develop interest into using cheats which is totally not fun.         Some of the most popular and very impactful cheats in game are:       * Techies can automatically detonate the amount of needed bombs anywhere in the map when a hero is in effect range.    * Phantom assassin(because he is the most popular with it) and other heroes with critical ability can hit critical damage all the time by cancelling the attack animation until it is certain that the attack  will deal critical damage. This is done by listening to audio files. This is not humanly possible(Excuse me I have tried to do it and did manage to hit all critical srikes note that if you do so you will lose focus on many other aspects of the game. On the other hand their cheat is faster than what a human can do and will automatically follow the target if it is running while the cheater is trying to crit).    * Automatically disable euls hex stun enemies that become suddenly visible to you which prevents potential kills(when they blink or suddenly break from invisibility). This may include automatically killing heroes in death range together with other cheats.    * Automatically do combos of many different heroes including complex ones can be either abilities only items only or mix of both and may be done in order or without any sequence. Popular ones are lina euls combo and meepo combos axe combo kunkka combo necrophos combo unfair brewmaster controlled by script. This may also include orb walking stacking controlling multiple units(macroing) favorable to chen and enchantress cheaters to do certain things.    * Armlet toggling with no error. You will be only killed when it is impossible to survive.    * Rubick automatically steal spells of choice like ravage blackhole etc.    * Vision cheat map range cheat displaying enemy wards displaying enemy courier's location.    * Anti-smoke of deceit anti-gank show if you can be seen by the opponents. May also display invisible units/heroes like riki and clinkz.    * Display opponent's items skills mana and cooldown.    * Differentiate enemy hero from illusion.    * Show roshan timer show runes show creep spawn boxes show next screep spawn(both lane and jungle).    * Automatically juke escape and chase; preventing enemy from juking preventing escape.    * Global spell cheat(showing where opponents' skills were cast like invoker's sun strike or do the opposite which automatically cast global spells to opponents even when in fog which most likely result into a kill).    * Automatically dodge skillshots like mirana's arrow and pudge's hook may optionally show its trajectory. Can do the opposite which is to cast accurate skillshots to opponents.    * Display amount of health the enemy will have left after casting all spells and showing the amount of hits before the opponent is killed.    * Instantly drop mana items use soul ring and then pick up items again.    * Instantly pick up dropped items by opponents(Effective only when the opponens is not scripting).    * Show blink range automatically blink maximum distance.    * Indicate attack and skill range of heroes units and towers(both friendly and non friendly). This may also include creep aggro range    * Mark creeps when in last hit range. Alternatively script may automatically last hit and deny with the option to or not to show the last hit marker.    * Let the bot play the game(player can afk but still accomplish things). You can tell which is which by their behavior. They can finish your low priority matches.       That is just but a small list of what cheats these scripters/hackers are using that I saw in game. Surely you do not want to play against players using those. In order to decrease the possibility to play with them in the future and hopefully get them banned we need to report these fraud.   You can report them by opening their steam profile page clicking report button then choose suspected cheater. There input your description including what they did link(s) of the game they cheated and evidence. If you do not know their profile if it was private or you just did not look up their profile you can still see them by opening steam clicking view tab and then click players. You can see the players you recently played with there. The dotadev forums too can be usedI did report a few of them there and found that the same players were being reported. As long as their steam profile is reported one can help make the dota 2 community better. Valve is taking action but for me I feel that they are slow because out of the 13 players I reported only 2 of them were VAC banned.   Link that you might want to see:   https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1010-TOKN-8461   http://dev.dota2.com/   TL;DR: Always report cheaters. This will improve the community and save the game from being exploited.,article

An analysis of the new daily bonus hero pool: does rewarding players with a free mango affect their real-life fruit eating habits?,self.DotA2,TL;DR: Icefrog manipulates helpless DotA2 players to eat their fruits.   Hello everyone   With the introduction of patch 7.07 much has been said about the changing nature of DotA2.  The game has not been static; there have been large changes to the core of the game in the last two major patches.  Some people welcome these changes arguing in favor of keeping the game fresh while others lament they no longer recognize the game they once loved.  Indeed Icefrog has major influence on the direction of gameplay but until 7.07 there has been little evidence to suggest that he is trying to also influence his player-bases real-life behavior.  The introduction of one major change to DotA2 in this patch may be a watershed moment in Icefrogs design strategy as he shifts from solely updating the game to slowly updating the players.  With the newly introduced feature of a rotating bonus hero pool Icefrog presents players with a positive reward (mango) for making use of the feature (picking or randoming one of the available 10 heroes).  **Put simply positive reinforcement is conditioning players to use the bonus pool: pick one of these 10 heroes and you get something of value in return.**  The player then considers the free mango a reward and associates the fruit with a sense of gain.   The purpose of the following analysis will be to assess what effects the introduction of the bonus hero pool had on players real-life fruit consumption and asks the following basic question:**did players who made use of the new bonus hero pool eat more fruit in the two weeks following the release of patch 7.07 compared to their baseline fruit consumption?**  To this end a two part survey was designed and posted on both the DotA2 subreddit and [my Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/aDotA2Analyst) to garner participation.  The first part of the survey was posted before the release of 7.07 while the second follow-up survey was sent two weeks after the release of 7.07 to those who participated in the first survey.  As a side note only part one of the survey was posted on reddit and Twitter (part two was sent directly to those who completed part one) and while neither post gained much attention (less than ten upvotes on reddit minimal likes on Twitter) it is interesting to note[ that nearly 90% of my responses came from reddit](https://imgur.com/a/KuJRK) (154 vs 21)suggesting this platforms ability to reach survey participants even with minimal post interaction is superior to Twitter.  In total 175 users responded to part one of the survey.  Participants were asked to leave a unique ID (reddit or Twitter username) so their responses could be matched between the two parts.  A combination of users not responding to the follow-up survey or not listing matching usernames between the two led to only 64 complete responses available to accurately study (36.57% of responses in part one)  with reddit users being both more responsive and better in leaving a matching username.  Therefore these 64 respondents answers to both surveys were used to answer the question of whether or not their fruit consumption increased after taking advantage of the bonus hero pool.  Each survey was comprised of about ten questions which asked players about both their real life and DotA2 habits.  Ultimately only one question from part one was relevant while the other nine were simply there to distract respondents from identifying the purpose of this study.  That question was: How often do you eat fruits?  Available responses were: Once a day 3 to 5 times a week Once or twice a week Two to three times a month or I do not eat fruits.  The relevant follow-up questions in part two asked if players had used the new bonus hero pool (Yes or No) and also their opinion on it (Like it overall Neutral or Dont like it overall) in addition to how often they had eaten fruit in the past two weeks (Daily 3 to 5 times a week Once or twice a week Only once or twice or I did not eat fruit).  In order to denote change in fruit consumption the above responses were converted to numerical ranks as seen in the table below (please note tables may not appear properly on mobile):  Response from Part 1| Response from Part 2| Rank ---|---|---- I do not eat fruits| I did not eat fruits| 0 Two to three times a month| Only once or twice| 1 Once or twice a week| Once or twice a week| 2 Three to five times a week| Three to five times a week| 3 Daily| Daily| 4   A participants responses between two surveys could then be compared by finding the net change between the two ranked values in each survey.  For example if a participant went from eating fruits once or twice a week (rank 2) to three to five times a week (rank 3) the net gain would be +1 (2-->3).  To test whether or not there was a net increase in the amount of fruit consumption across all 64 participants I applied a Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test to the data which showed no significant difference between fruit consumption before and after patch 7.07 (p=0.26).    Roughly two-thirds of participants (42/64) stated that they had used the new bonus hero pool since the patch release.  Therefore I repeated the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test using only answers from those 42 participants and those data suggested that there was a significant change (increase) in the amount of fruit consumption (p=0.04).  As a further proof of principle I next only considered the data from those 42 participants who stated they liked or were neutral to the bonus hero pool.  The logic to exclude those who did not like the change was based on the idea that those participants would not likely view the mango as a reward and therefore were less likely to associate real-life fruit as a positive.  Of the 42 just above 60% (26/42) either liked or were neutral to the bonus hero pool.  The full data set for the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test applied to these 26 participants can be seen below (table may not load properly on mobile):    Rank from Part 1| Rank from Part 2 ---|---- 2| 4| text 2| 3| text 3| 3| text 4| 4| text 1| 3| text 2| 4| text 1| 3| text 1| 1| text 2| 1| text 3| 3| text 2| 3| text 3| 4| text 2| 4| text 3| 3| text 2| 3| text 2| 3| text 2| 2| text 2| 3| text 1| 4| text 3| 4| text 2| 3| text 3| 3| text 1| 1| text 1| 2| text 1| 3| text 2| 3| text   These results are of particular interest as the [Z-value \(-3.4623\) yields a more highly significant corresponding p value \(0.00054\)](https://imgur.com/a/AZ40I) when only this subset of 26 participants who liked or were neutral to the bonus pool change were considered.  The mean of ranks between participants in part one versus part two also reflect a significant increase in average rank (part one=2.04 part two=2.96).   **Taken together these results strongly suggest that those who took advantage of the new bonus hero pool had an increase in fruit consumption during the two weeks post patch 7.07 release compared to their baseline fruit consumption pre-7.07.**   Indeed this pilot study has a number of limitations that should be addressed.  The sample size was not particularly large especially when considering smaller subsets of data as in the text above.  Further this study only assessed one time-point after setting a baseline and additional data points would need to be taken over time to better understand trends in fruit eating behavior.  To statistically test the data a ranking system akin to a Likert scale was applied to rank fruit eating consumption rates.  The Likert scale is not a perfect fit for these data nor is it easy to test paired Likert data for significance.  There is debate in the [literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8582561) over the appropriateness of using a t-test (or other methods) versus the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test applied here.  A sign test was not used as I preferred a way to incorporate degree of change between surveys: a simple + change does not fully capture the magnitude of going from rank 1-->4.  Even with its faults I believe the signed-rank test can be an appropriate test for this study due to its conservative nature with caveats of course.    Overall this study has presented the first evidence to date that Icefrogs patches to DotA2 can change players real life behavior.  This first of its kind paired study followed participants fruit eating habits over a two week course post-7.07 (now you get a bonus mango picking a bonus hero) and compared it to baseline consumption pre-7.07 (no bonus mangoes).  **The total cohort (n=64) did not exhibit a statistically significant increase in fruit consumption.  However sub-cohorts of only those who had tried picking a bonus hero (n=42) and of those 42 those who liked or were neutral to the change (n=26) revealed statistically significant increases in fruit consumption.**  Thus I propose the incorporation of a bonus mango into the game has led players to change their fruit eating habits potentially leading to more healthy lifestyles.  Future patches should be studied in detail to assess for additional efforts by Icefrog to influence players real-life behavior.  Thank you for reading and I look forward to your comments.  ,article
[Ars] The International 2016: the greatest event not just in Dota 2 but in all of e-sports,arstechnica.com,,article
PH match fixing scandal turns from bad to worse; Arrow Gaming implicated,self.DotA2,**The match-fixing scandal**       Around five days ago screenshots of conversations between Michael Vincent Vallejos and Jonathan Radores made rounds on Social Media. The images portray the two talking about the then upcoming [MSI-Mineski](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/4485-starladder-season-10/1182-round-robin-season/4487-south-east-asia/matches/52319-mineski-dota2-vs-msi-evogt-tric) match a non-bearing game (as both teams have no more chance to advance) in the Starladder 10 SEA qualifiers. Vallejos is the owner of the one of the largest and arguably the most successful Philippine Dota 2 trading group named MyDota2Community while Radores was a former pro player. The latter was involved in a [scamming incident](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/news/27395-julz-involved-in-scamming-incident-xctn-swaps-players) some six months ago wherein he used the Steam account of Julius Julz De Leon to complete a deal involving Dota 2 items and cash.          Among the earlier images were these conversation pictures between Vallejos and Radores where the two talked about what supposedly will happen during the game. MSI captain JyC is supposedly having a mispick or a bad draft and they will also supposedly let Mineski pick Tinker. Another picture shows that JyC was asking PHP 40000 (892~ USD) for that game. Mineski was indeed able to get the Tinker while MSI went with a quad-melee lineup. Interestingly MSI was actually dominating until they were ratted by the Lycan and Tinker late into the game.          All the images were sent and/or uploaded using anonymous Facebook accounts. While the majority reacted violently regarding the matter a number of reasonable individuals also questioned the integrity of these images. Among those are of course the two involved organizations in Mineski and MSI.         Those doubts were to be quelled however as evidence started to pile up. [GosuGamers reported suspicious betting activities](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/news/28802-msi-and-mineski-accused-in-matchfixing-scandal) on that match as well as the [Mineski-Immunity](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/4485-starladder-season-10/1182-round-robin-season/4487-south-east-asia/matches/52349-team-immunity-dota2-vs-mineski-dota2) match. New screenshots also resurfaced and a video of someone skimming through Radores Facebook account was also shown. Radores claims (and for a change it definitely appears that this was the case here) that his account was hacked but he never questioned the content of the messages on his inbox.       Somewhere between those happenings both MSI and Mineski retracted their statement of full trust to their team (particularly MSI) and they switched into an investigative stand. They also placed the alleged involved members (the whole team for MSI three members for Mineski) into preventive suspension and that these players will not be allowed to join any online or offline tournaments until further notice.        Around this time this editor was able to verify that PHP 40000 (892~ USD) was indeed paid to MSI for them to throw their game against Mineski and that Mineski threw their game against Immunity. Those were confirmed through several concerned individuals who sent uncensored screenshots to him and these people were told first-hand that these things had taken place.        Between all the circulating screenshots regarding the matter there were a total of three games that were questioned - all of which are non-bearing games Starladder 10 SEA qualifier games. The matches are [Mineski-MSI](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/4485-starladder-season-10/1182-round-robin-season/4487-south-east-asia/matches/52319-mineski-dota2-vs-msi-evogt-tric) (25 Sept) [MSI-Awake](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/4485-starladder-season-10/1182-round-robin-season/4487-south-east-asia/matches/52362-msi-evogt-tric-vs-awake) (26 Sept) and [Mineski-Immunity](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/4485-starladder-season-10/1182-round-robin-season/4487-south-east-asia/matches/52349-team-immunity-dota2-vs-mineski-dota2) (27 Sept).      **The confession and the aftermath**      Nearly two days ago the eight players in question approached Dexter Ancheta who was acting as the neutral party between MSI and Mineski managements The players have admitted their involvement on the match-fixing incident. Upon forwarding their apology letter all of them also effectively resigned from their respective teams.            Trading and betting site Dota2Lounge also investigated the issue after they got wind of it on their [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/dota2loungebets/comments/2j3ft8/322_philippines_dota_revealed/). Not that any more evidence is needed after the earlier screenshots and the letter of apology the betting history of the players supported the issue. Three MSI players betting history showed that they have placed a bet against their own team ([1](http://i.imgur.com/rwUMsHS.png) [2](http://i.imgur.com/cQRgmbO.png) [3](http://i.imgur.com/wWl8KW9.png)) and one Mineski players was [caught](http://i.imgur.com/DGYzUsF.png) doing the same.        Vallejos betting history was also checked and it indeed showed him betting on the fixed matches. There were three of them but interestingly he only had bets on two matches from those previously mentioned (This may imply that he was unaware of the MSI-Awake match-fixing). The issue has branched further anew and its not about the [poaching and revenge issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2j7b5k/philippine_dota_2_it_is_real_and_not_only_2/).         **Enter Malaysian team and TI4 SEA qualifier winner Arrow Gaming.**         Vallejos has placed large bets using multiple accounts on Arrow Gaming ([1](http://i.imgur.com/yPEGZUB.png) [2](http://i.imgur.com/KT917LO.png) [3](http://i.imgur.com/JqZudZl.png) [4](http://i.imgur.com/3nGIHBa.png) [5](http://i.imgur.com/LbXnzZr.png) [6](http://i.imgur.com/hfDFCOA.png)) on their [Synergy League Group stage match against Australian team Cant Say Wips](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/4937-synergy-league/1295-sea-groups/4940-group-a/matches/56085-can-t-say-wips-vs-arrow-gaming) last 13 October the same day the initial screenshots of this issue first surfaced. While CSW has been on a streak heading into the match Arrow was still the favorite. Synergy league has a forgiving format with the top four teams of the eight-team group advancing into the next stage.        That match was further investigated and it has shown a number of new accounts which has high bets on this match and the several fixed matches that was mentioned earlier ([1](http://i.imgur.com/TpoeuwK.png) [2](http://i.imgur.com/gCkd9YS.png) [3](http://i.imgur.com/vqS7TZV.png) [4](http://i.imgur.com/4KsMoGk.png) [5](http://i.imgur.com/Gh0a4P5.png) [6](http://i.imgur.com/gbh1a03.png)). However the most telling of the bets were the ones made on the accounts of [ddzs girlfriend](http://i.imgur.com/T53eXMu.png) as well as Lances girlfriend ([1](http://i.imgur.com/TxJklcj.png) [2](http://i.imgur.com/3kztFVU.png)). Something which may or may not be related is the latter [betting for Immunity against Mineski](http://i.imgur.com/yNLnmp2.png).       There was a screenshot of a conversation between Vallejos and Radores where the former said [he has many other teams by their throat](http://imgur.com/dlA3Fu0) implying that they are also under his control. However investigation regarding the bets shows nothing of the sort or at least nothing related to this case. First Departure who has been experiencing a slump expressed their feelings about the matter through their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/1stDeparture).        The involved Philippine players aside from their still imposed Mineski ban wa also banned by TNC ESports a local tournament organizer. They also lost their slot on The Summit 2s Asian qualifiers. Arrow Gaming on the other hand may follow similar treatment if these proof are found as conclusive. They are currently taking part in multiple tournaments which includes Synergy League MSI Beat It and The Summit 2.  D2L is most likely going to take a stand to not cover any games in the near future of the involved teams.      These bet screenshots were provided by Dota2Lounge. Asked whether they think that the publics easy access to betting high value items was suspect of this incident or if they think it would have happened otherwise D2L admin Honey has this to say:        >Tough question. (The answer is) Yes and no. I think it is a factor that lead to the idea of creating this drama. But at the same time people with huge power and bad intentions will always find a way to gain regardless of morals or thought of others. So I think this was somewhat inevitable regardless of D2L or not.    While these findings would surely discourage any other teams who might be planning on undertaking such a treacherous action things like this may all we be inevitable given the continuous rise of eSports the exponential increase of tournaments and matches and the relative ease of achieving it. Honey gives a reassuring statement to deter people who has malignant intentions.        >We're constantly keeping an eye on what's happening with bets like suspicious bets huge payouts and whatnot. At the same time upsets are a fairly common occurrence. However when drama like this happens we are more than willing to get to the bottom of it and provide as much information that is needed.   Dota2Lounge by far the largest Dota 2 betting site in terms of the number of bets made introduced value betting last 22 May of this year. This increased the actual amount of what people can bet while still maintaining the four-item bet limit a big change from its old system of straight up counting the waged items (which can be a common an uncommon a rare or a key). The highest-value which can be used to bet right now is a Standard Scythe of Vyse which would amount to a value of more or less $240 when four of this is wagered in a match.

An analysis of the grade levels at which DotA2 heroes speak and the correlation between simple language and increased pick rate.,self.DotA2,"Hello everyone  TL;DR: Keep it simple (for the) stupid.  Speaking in everyday life and more so in professional settings it is critical to get your ideas across to the audience.  Generally it is best to keep the point you are trying to make simple so that it can be easily understood.  You don't want to confuse the other party with circuitous logic or by using complex and convoluted words that can leave the listener questioning exactly what it was they just heard.  In other words stay on message and keep that message simple.  A good example of this was this past election in the United States.  One of the reasons for the Republican candidate's popularity and ultimately his election was his use of simple messages and slogans.  A [recent study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1603/1603.05739.pdf) looked at the ""grade level"" at which multiple candidates' speeches were made based on vocabulary and syntax.  The President-elect consistently spoke at a seventh grade level while his opponents scored more like high schoolers (grades 8-10).  Simplicity in this case seemed to be better.  **In this study I will apply the same ""grade level"" predicting tools to DotA2 heroes' voice lines to determine if their popularity is linked to how basic their spoken words are.**  To this end I carried out the following methods.  The entire list of a hero's spoken voice lines was collected and then submitted to the online[ Lexicon-based Reading Difficulty Prediction tool REAP](http://reap.cs.cmu.edu/demo/readability2012/index.php) (Reader-Specific Lexical Practice for Improved Reading Comprehension) from Carnegie-Mellon.  The tool would then assign a predicted ""grade level"" to the hero's speech based on how complex it is.  This was repeated for all heroes and then grade levels and hero popularity were compared.  For this study all-time number of picks per hero was used as the metric for popularity so caveats should be made for recently added heroes such as Underlord.    Chart One| All Heroes| Strength Heroes| Intelligence Heroes| Agility Heroes ---|---|----|----|---- Mean Grade| 3.098| 3.351| 3.125| 2.800 Median Grade | 3| 3| 3| 3 Mode Grade| 3| 3| 3| 3   Chart one above summarizes some overall numbers from this analysis.  When looking across the board at all heroes the average reading difficulty is third grade; this also holds true when looking at median and mode.  Right off the bat it is clear that DotA2 heroes are speaking at a basic level or something that we can all easily latch on to without much thought.  Teasing the data a little further I separated heroes out into their respective class; Strength Intelligence or Agility.  Rather unexpectedly Strength heroes appeared to speak at the highest level not Intelligence heroes.  Although the three groups are clustered relatively close overall.  Now back to the question at hand. **Is there a link between hero popularity and their language complexity?** See [graph one here](http://imgur.com/a/XShsI) where I plotted out the individual grade level for each hero.  The most popular heroes are on the left and they decrease in popularity (number of times picked) as you go down the X-axis.  While there is no observable trend throughout the entire plot it was clear that some of the most popular heroes scored the lowest grade level one.  These heroes included the three top picked heroes Pudge (by far the most picked) Phantom Assassin and Sniper.   To further look into this phenomenon I decided to crunch some numbers.  In chart two below I calculated the average number of times heroes in each grade group were picked. Grades 5 and above were combined due to the small number of heroes found in higher grades. Interestingly there is a trend for higher grade levels to be picked less on average and furthermore grade one heroes are by far the most often picked group.  **This suggests there is some correlation between the complexity of a heroes voice lines and how often it is played.**  Chart Two |  Grade 1 Heroes |  Grade 2 Heroes |  Grade 3 Heroes |  Grade 4 Heroes | Grade 5+ Heroes  -------|---------|--------|--------|--------|---- Average number of times picked|  129830043|  112825047|  110340338|  106191182| 104396512  So what does this all mean?  I believe it gets back to what was mentioned at the start.  People crave simplicity and brevity when listening to others.  You want someone to pay attention?  Keep your message simple.  This principle seems to apply to DotA2 as well; we are picking heroes who speak an ""easier"" language.  Indeed the three most popular heroes in the game speak at the level of a first grader and as a group these first grade heroes are picked more often than any other.  To put it simply we pick what we like and that includes a hero with a simple message.  Thank you for reading and I look forward to your comments.   **Author's Note:**  Some of you may have already noticed that [Io](http://imgur.com/a/nSuq0) and [Phoenix](http://imgur.com/a/tHJPl) speak at a grade level of 10 which I assume is due to the vastly superior intelligence of the computer algorithm being able to make sense of their languages and conclude that these two heroes were speaking at a fairly high level.",article
Complete list of dispels undispellable buffs magic immunity and dispels strong dispels etc.,self.DotA2,"TL;DR: http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel  I was looking for some kind of overview of how purges work. Some buffs could be dispelled others couldn't. BKB removes some things Juggernaut's spin others diffusal blade removed some other stuff. Then there's things like Press the Attack and Apothic Shield which seems to remove just about everything... except they don't.  The ingame descriptions would only hint at ""some buffs and some debuffs"" to be removed but there were no consistency and it wouldn't differentiate between the different kinds of spells. The wiki had some markers of ""purgeable"" abilities but no overview; and the article about purges had a list but I could tell it was incomplete and it even had some misinformation. Exploring old DotA forums I found some post about diffusal blade interactions but it too was outdated. There were some info about triggered buffs and hardcoded buffs but with Dota 2 not being wc3 that was mostly a moot point there are several disparities when it comes to purges nothing could be taken at a face value.  All in all there were no complete up to date overview of dispels. So I made one.   Armed with the lobby system cheats a spreadsheet some music and a complete lack of anything resembling a social life I went through each hero and item ability in the game and tested them vs. the different types of dispels. A few days and some 400*6 abilities later this is the result:  http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel  Now I'm no web designer I tried to patch the info up with some collapsible tables and color coded cells to make it digestable but there's only so much you can do to hide the fact it's a giant list of a fuckton of spells. It's still very much a work in progress. On the other hand it's on the wiki so anyone can improve it I guess.  Some disclaimers: I couldn't bother testing each and every dispel the ones listed as ""normal dispels"" seemed to work exactly the same so I just took a couple from those to test with (Diffusal Blade and Euls). There used to be more differences between say manta and diffusal blade but from what I hear Valve has been patching those up.  Also when it comes to dispels there are quite a lot of disparities/bugs between DotA and Dota 2. For instance AA's Ice Blast is dispellable with Diffusal Blade or Manta in DotA but not in Dota 2. And sometimes a skill is implemented differently Shadow Fiend's damage reduction is a buff applied in an aoe in DotA that can be purged but in Dota 2 it is a temporary aura with SF as the carrier which can not be dispelled.  This list should not be taken as a source of how dispels *should* work but rather as a source of information of how dispels currently behave in Dota 2.  -----  On another note I also wrote an article about disjoints a while back worth a look if you haven't already: http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Disjoint",article

A 5.5k player's perspective on how to gain MMR.,self.DotA2,"Hi all. When ranked mm first came out I calibrated at 3.7k. I'm now 5.5k solo though I've been hovering in and out of the leaderboards for the last week. I thought I might share some of my thoughts on gaining mmr that might be helpful/new to many of you. Everything here refers to solo queue though most of it's also applicable to playing with friends.  1. MMR is a reflection of someone's overall skill level. However given how complex of a game dota is it's a relatively coarse measurement. Some people might say MMR doesn't mean anything and they would be wrong. It is by definition (ie you gain mmr when you win and you lose mmr when you lose) a measurement of how capable you are at winning games.  2. As a reflection of your skill level you can't increase your mmr in the long term (ie ignoring short term fluctuations due to randomness) without actually becoming better at winning games. This sentence is a little vague and some ways of making the sentence precise are false but essentially the philosophy behind this is that in order to increase your mmr you must either A) Become a better player or B) Make your team play better.  3. I will first consider option (A) above - ie getting better at dota. Now there are tons of guides applicable to all sorts of skill ranges that discuss this in varying levels of detail so what I'm going to focus on aren't the details. I'm going to consider the big picture which is.  4. So how do you get better at ANYTHING? Suppose you want to learn to play Chopin's Ballade in G minor. This is a very difficult piece of music for the piano and is about 8-10 pages long (iirc). If you want to get better at playing this you could begin by sightreading it and trying to play the entire thing extremely slowly which could take you as much as 20-30 minutes depending on how much you stumble. And then maybe you could do it again and again and again. Eventually you'll get better at the piece but this would be an extremely inefficient way of learning the piece. Why? Because your brain doesn't have enough working memory to store the entire playthrough of the piece along with all the little details and bits that you stumbled on so if you stumbled on a part near the beginning by the time you've reached the end 20 minutes later you've probably forgotten about that stumble near the beginning and it becomes difficult to use the memory of that stumbling to get better at playing that part in future playthroughs. Instead what pretty much every piano student does is to divide the piece into parts and practice each part thoroughly before moving on to the next part. The parts may vary in length between only a few measures to an entire page with the most difficult parts being the shortest in length (so you can play them as many times as possible in a reasonable practice session). The same philosophy holds in dota. It's really difficult to just become a better dota player without focusing on the areas you need to improve on. However instead of dividing up dota into aspects like last hitting map awareness etc. I think it's just as reasonable to divide it into heroes. If you want to get better at dota what I would advocate is picking a small list of heroes (maybe 2-4 heroes) that you just focus on getting better at and play them all 10-20 times each. This takes us to the next step.  5. SELF-ASSESSMENT... is hard especially with such a complex game as dota. In fact assessing how well you're doing what you need to improve on is difficult no matter what you're trying to learn. This is why people hire teachers/go to class. Now while I think hiring a high-mmr player to coach you will definitely help you get better I understand many dota players are poor and don't want to use what little cash they have this way (buying hats is obviously a much better use of your money o.0). Honestly I can't tell you how to best analyze your own play. There are so many things to consider for that to write them here would make this post literally unreadable. However I can say that honestly the key to getting better is to *NEVER* go into a game hoping to win. Winning is great but ultimately it is a side effect to playing well and your goal going into every game is to *play well*. You should constantly be thinking about what *your* best next move is. Sometimes you will need to coordinate with your team but every time you try to coordinate you should know that there's a chance they don't cooperate in which case you should have a backup plan for what *you* should do if they don't cooperate. If you think you should gank the enemy carry but you need the help of your mid you can ask him to help you but if he says no or doesn't respond going in solo would be stupid so have a backup plan! (which could even be to just farm).  6. Why shouldn't you go into a game hoping to win? Because it's too easy to spend anywhere from 10 seconds to a few minutes dwelling on your allies mistakes (every time they happen) and pondering your own misfortune at being teamed up with these idiots instead of thinking about what you should be doing *right now*. For me often when I hit a record mmr I become terrified of losing it and as a result the next time I play a game and someone on my team (or even me) makes a mistake I might spend 30s arguing with them if it was their mistake or defending myself if it was my mistake during which I just go into autopilot and stop thinking about how to best spend my time. I can't count the number of times this has caused me to lose focus not watch the map as closely and get ganked exacerbating the problem. If you don't focus on winning but instead on playing well recognizing the fact that there's roughly a 50% chance of you losing this game then it becomes easier to just note the mistakes that were made move on and maintain your focus. Plus this way it's easier to look back on every game and feel good about the lessons you've learned that game. Whether you won or lost is irrelevant. If you're learning from mistakes then you're becoming a better player and your mmr will naturally increase in the long term as a result. To this end if you don't have a tough skin don't be afraid to mute people who flame you. Personally in the loading screen of every game I make sure I unmute everyone. Then once the game starts as soon as someone flames me I tell them if they keep flaming me in a nonconstructive manner I'm going to mute them and I follow through with the promise. Yes dota is a team game and communication is important to winning but in the end your goal should be to focus on your own play and play well and if your teammates are making that difficult for you then muting them is the obvious solution (and may make you end up winning the game anyway thanks to your better play).  7. The next goal to have when going into a game is to use the data you get from the game to revise the model of the game that you have in your head. I can't count the number of times I've gotten doomsayers on your team saying ""omg that AM is so farmed its gg"" or ""gg no gank spectre"". Then when the teamfights roll in their AM or specter gets hexed and blown up or somehow get kited or don't do enough damage and you win. If you find yourself saying something like that and then still end up winning the game you should really think about at the end of the game why you were wrong. Honestly there could be a thousand reasons. Generally this comes in two flavors. Firstly maybe your team actually had good ways to deal with the enemy no matter how farmed they get in which case identifying the factors that let your team deal with the enemy carry should be very valuable in making the model of dota you have in your head more accurate. Secondly maybe your enemy carry made a mistake. Now this is much harder to identify and unless you're a pro a lot of things you might consider mistakes actually aren't mistakes and vice versa. Either way even if he actually made a mistake you should think - why did he make this mistake? What was he thinking? Is this a mistake that is often made at your mmr? For example it's very common in mmrs below 4k to get absolute freefarm for the first 15 minutes and to think that you can just go ham on the enemy as a 1100 hp luna with treads drums midas dominator without realizing that 1100 hp isn't actually very much and in a teamfight without a bkb you can easily get disabled and focused down before you can even press R (in fact it's an interesting aspect of dota that given two teams with exactly the same hero compositions and exactly the same items/levels that teamfights will often be stomps in one way or the other - ie good initiations and vision advantages via high grounds/wards is incredibly important). Anyway if they made a mistake that is often made then that's something you can exploit in the future when playing against a farmed <whatever> and something you should note not to do when playing as a farmed <whatever>. In fact if you understand why he made the mistake you can even try to bait out the mistake by creating similar conditions in the future. For example if 3v3 fight breaks out somewhere on the map (especially at a tower) often the other 4 heroes might watch the fight and try to decide if they should tp to help or keep farming. In that situation the enemy carry might take an extra second to react to you trying to gank him with the 2 heroes on your team not in that fight and as a result die due to not backing up in time. Was that a mistake? Yes! Did you get lucky that he was slow to escape? Yes! But the point was that you made your own luck by timing the gank to coincide with a fight that caused him to look away from his hero.  8. Of course the above point relies on having *accurate* data. You can't improve your theory/model of how dota works without accurate data which is sometimes difficult to collect in game since things often happen so fast. However thankfully there is such a thing as the amazing downloadable replay. If you're really serious about getting better at dota then watching your replays is an absolute necessity. Knowing what to look for in a replay is difficult and I can't really write everything down but a few things to consider are: How did this fight start? Were we looking for a fight? Should we have been looking for a fight? If we won/lost did I think we were going to win/lose at the beginning of the fight? How does this fit with my theory of dota? Here the last question is especially important as often in mmrs below 4k the vast majority of fights are actually just a cacophony of fuckups. Everyone misses their spells or uses them on the wrong targets people run when they should be chasing or chase when they should be running so it's incredibly important to understand what mistakes were made (especially by you) and to understand if the fight *should* have been a win or a loss. Of course even most <5k players won't be able to actually answer these questions correctly but at least thinking about the question allows you to have a basepoint from which you can adjust your answers/theory of dota in light of more data from future games and similar fights.   9. I'm getting a bit tired now and so I'll end with this last point which is - how do you make your team play better? (ie (B) from point 2) A lot of people are emotional when they play dota and the variation in the quality of someone's play from game to game in part can be attributed to their state of mind. People enjoy the feeling of being a part of a cooperative team who's got each others backs so if you can somehow instill that feeling in your teammates you're actually improving your ability to win the game without actually being any better at dota yourself (this is the second way of gaining mmr!) There are a number of ways to do this. Essentially you just want to be serious but friendly. You want to limit your communication to things that are useful to your teammates such as missing calls pinging runes noting which enemy heros are carrying wards where they placed them...etc. You should *never* flame allies. It will only make them play worse. You can point out mistakes your allies made only if you are *positive* it was a mistake and if you think they are likely to make the same mistakes again in the same game but you want to be as *specific* as possible and never phrase it in an aggressive tone. Give your supports farm. A 2k networth support at 30 minutes is actually worthless. If you're a core hero feel free to tell your supports to take a lane when you're off ganking or when you're strong enough to jungle. This applies to other cores too. Sometimes after I start a tp to a lane to farm the incoming creep wave a teammate will still tp there after me. That's obviously a waste of time for us so I would generally say something like ""can I have this please"" and if he still tries to compete for the last hits I'll just move into the jungle or do something else.  10. Lastly here's a trick I often use : At the beginning of the game if I sense a bad atmosphere for whatever reason I will find a reason to commend some player on my team (and actually commend them and announce that you're commending them for <whatever>). The reason should only have to do with their attitude not their skill and ideally you should do this as early as possible. Everyone likes to be commended so the person you commended will probably like you more hence improving the team dynamics between you two but more importantly the people who *weren't* commended are now aware that you actually commend people and as a result may subconsciously change their behavior in a way to also deserve a commend from you. For example last night when I noticed that my game was on page 22 and hence I was probably playing with a bunch of 4k players after our solo support said depressingly ""great I'm solo support again..."" and proceeded to buy courier and wards I instantly commended him and announced ""commended teal for his attitude"". That was honestly the best game I've ever had with a bunch of 4k strangers (he also continued to buy support items in a timely manner for the rest of the game!). Even if 3 of your teammates are already flaming each other right out of the gate you can even commend the person who didn't say anything for ""keeping a cool head"" or something.  TLDR:  1. Focus on your own play. Never go into a game hoping to win. Always go into a game trying to play well and learn from mistakes. 2. Keep a model/theory of dota in your head. Constantly think about how your experiences in games fits with that model and adjust it accordingly. Watch replays. 3. Happy teammates = better teammates. You can win games solely off of making your teammates feel good. Be friendly but serious. Never flame. Make constructive criticism if you think it will help. Commend people for their attitude.",article
I'm the guy who wrote those articles in PC Gamer and I'm starting up a Dota 2 blog,self.DotA2,That's the long and short of it. I like writing about Dota 2 and I plan to do more of it. You can find the blog and the (silly) first post here:  [Three Lane Highway](http://3lane.tumblr.com/)  The plan is to write one or two things a week.   Thanks /r/dota2! I read you every day and you seem nice.,article
I am DDZ ! I am NOT 322 !,self.DotA2,Hello everyone I am ddz from ArrowGaming. Yesterday I have been receiving many PMs from friends asking me about the accusation PacificRen throw at me and Lance at Reddit.  First I would like to stress that I have never bet against my own team or have any intention to do so. All the competition games I have played so far I have tried my very best to win them.   This is my bet history (can be verified by D2L staff)  * BetHistory1 http://prntscr.com/4xh8xh * BetHistory2 http://prntscr.com/4xh94i * BetHistory3 http://prntscr.com/4xh9ar * BetHistory4 http://prntscr.com/4xh9hi * BetHistory5 http://prntscr.com/4xh9pe * BetHistory6 http://prntscr.com/4xh9xm * BetHistory7 http://prntscr.com/4xhaea (Arrow vs CSW game where I lost Arcana)  As for my gf's bet against my team I totally have no idea about it. After I inquire her about this she told me she was just helping her friend to bet. This is the conversation she had with her friend. http://prntscr.com/4xppas whereby her friend asked her to help bet. D2L has already investigated this and checked her trade history. I am in no way associated with her choice of betting or profit from it.  From the replay of Arrow vs CSW itselfit is evident that 5 of us got disconnected during the draft phase. Then during the early game phase 5 of us disconnected again. The internet connection was really unstable that time and my PC was lagging badly during war which is the reason why my performance wasn't so good that game.  **PacificRen claims:** *Vallejos has placed large bets using multiple accounts on Arrow Gaming (1 2 3 4 5 6) on their Synergy League Group stage match against Australian team Cant Say Wips last 13 October the same day the initial screenshots of this issue first surfaced. While CSW has been on a streak heading into the match Arrow was still the favorite. Synergy league has a forgiving format with the top four teams of the eight-team group advancing into the next stage. That match was further investigated and it has shown a number of new accounts which has high bets on this match and the several fixed matches that was mentioned earlier (1 2 3 4 5 6).*  I just want to ask does PacificRen has any hard evidence proving Vallejos is related to me? Has anyone checked his trade history? Are the 6 accounts belong to me? Everything was purely speculation and assumption that he knows me and I am profiting from his huge bets. Honestly I have never heard of his name. In fact I strongly deny my involvement in this.  The reason why people are betting against us is probably because rumor was spreading fast to everyone few hours before the game that my PC and Lance's PC were lagging.   * Evidence1 http://prntscr.com/4xk2jv (Lance chat with gf before match) * Evidence2 http://prntscr.com/4xfn4e (My chat with a friend before match)  As for Lances girlfriend all the time she has always been betting on/against the team independently. http://prntscr.com/4xhi6a as you can see she bet against our team on 2/7/2014 as she feels Titan was a stronger team than our team during that time. I think it was pretty obvious before TI Titan was a better team. There was no one talking about this. This is her decision and Lance honestly has no control over her. Also her bets were relatively moderate http://prntscr.com/4xk2wz . Her friend also did suggest to her to bet on team CSW http://prntscr.com/4xk4mr along with another friend who asked her to help him place bets along with her own bets on team CSW http://prntscr.com/4xkban  http://prntscr.com/4xkbhj. She also did ask Lance about his teams condition and made her own decision to bet on which team: http://prntscr.com/4xk2jv  Another question I would like to raise there are no rules stating players gf isnt allowed to bet. Alright if you are saying the girlfriends are closely related to the players and there might be a conflict of interest/insider info leaked out.   **What about people who are active in e-Sports and well-known in the scene? Are they allowed to bet?**  Everyone knows you are quite well-known in the SEA scene with close relationship with all the professional players. This is evident from your position where you were a senior Dota2 editor in GGnet writer for Pacific.eSports and close-friends with other well-known Dota2 players in the scene. Does this mean you shouldnt be betting too right? Like I know you are good friends with all the PH Professional Dota2 players etc. We can also ask ourselves did you ever bet against your friends and won. You also knew something right?   Evidence 1 - http://prntscr.com/4xq5uf (taken from your bet history) (You were betting against Mineski your countryman do you have insider info they will lose that day? 2 arcanas were bet that day.)  I think its quite unfair to point all the fingers at us just because the guy who mastermind the 322 scandal Vallejos had huge bets on my team when all of them had never heard of his name before. Also I would like to stress that I have no control over my girlfriend. She can bet on me or against me its entirely up to her. Like I said PacificRen is quite well-known in the PH Dota scene and the guy or 'judge' HANDLING this investigation. Yet he himself is betting against a team he should be favoring should he be suspected of matchfixing too?  I try to be as honest as possible and sometimes my pc lags or internet lags I just tell my friends the truth when they ask me. Then I have no control what they do with this information. Its entirely out of my control.  Personally my team's issue is totally different from the matchfixing between MSI and Mineski. For that case there was clear evidence with supporting chat messages that Vallejos had direct contact with their players. For our case we have no idea who this guy is and I think it's unfair for PacificRen to implicate and associate our case with theirs.  The main question for our situation is the line drawn between the players and the person who are betting against them. Whether it's the girlfriend/family members/close friends there should be a clear rule stating they are not allowed to bet. This question has never been raised before and after the finding of this association everyone just point the fingers at us claiming we matchfixing. This is totally unfair to us.  That's all from me. You are free to judge.  *Translated and Evidence compiled by Lance and Ddz with the help of some friends* ,article

Team Liquid salaries range from $100k to $200k,self.DotA2,"https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16155504/dota2-the-international-valve-2017-esports-economics  ""This week I spoke with Victor Goossens the co-CEO of Team Liquid the group that won TI7 and collected a prize of $10862683. Not every team operates like Liquid which is a pro organization with investor funding and e-sports teams represented in League of Legends and Counter-Strike. It covers the expenses of its five Dota players and provides them with training facilities all the PC hardware they could ever want and support services like a mental coach. Oh and an annual salary that ranges between $100000 and $200000. At the conclusion of TI the $10 million was split eight ways between the organization the five players and the dedicated manager and coach. Goossens tells me that winning TI was the biggest day in Team Liquid history which Im inclined to read was as important economically as competitively. How does a team like Liquid survive without winning TI?""",article

Okay so who the heck are all these new names appearing in Chinese Dota following the reshuffle? Let me tell you.,self.DotA2,Almost every major Chinese team is now featuring at least one player that is likely completely unheard of for most fans. Here's some quick information (players are presented in order of their team positions):  **Invictus Gaming:**   *qdFerarri_430 Xxs Boboka rong*      IG has promoted it's academy team IG Vitality to the main squad whilst retaining 430. These players were previously apart of Team DK.S and where acquired by IG to form IG.V when Team DK closed it's doors in late 2015. qd also played under the ID black.z. Prior to being recruited by Team DK these players had no prior professional experience and were coached by Burning. Under the banner of DK.S they enjoyed limited success for such a short period of time playing notably winning the Chinese open qualifier for the Frankfurt major and defeating FanTuan and IG in the group stages.  **Invictus Gaming Vitality:**   *Yuno Op InJuly dogf1ght super*    This team undoubtedly has more recognisable names than the main IG squad. Super and Yuno both drop down from the main team and are joined by Op InJuly from FanTuan and dogf1ghts from Vici Gaming Potential.  The names super and InJuly probably ring a few bells from the Chinese qualifers for TI4 where DT^Club made their run upsetting notably TongFu HGT and CDEC but also New Element (with Shiki) and Orenda (with Zyf). These players (Air InJuly XDD Super Xiaotuji (aka Rabbit) Prettyhaw) have all done the rounds many many times notably coming together on Dream Time (DT^Club) and Rising stars but also splitting up onto various t2 Chinese teams. I could go through their history here but it's not much of a story so much as it is Chinese T2 club pass the parcel. The point is they've been around for a long time just as long as many of the big names in Chinese Dota 2.  Yuno is the Chinese 8000 MATCH MAKING POINTS player being the first to reach 8K on their servers and being recruited by Yaphets (aka PIS) when he rebooted the Immortal Magneto team last year. He followed Yaphets to form a new team FanTuan with ZSMJ when he left HGT following the Frankfurt Major qualifiers. After the team failed to qualify for the Winter Major he was recruited into Invictus Gaming to replace Ferarri_430 who was on a break following IG's poor performance in the same event.  Dogf1ghts was noticed when standing in for T2 Chinese teams like CNB.cn and LAI gaming (another incarnation of DT Club featuring Xz who would play offlane for CDEC in their 2nd place finish at TI5). Following this he was recruited to join Vici Gaming Potential.  I think Op is brand new to the scene. IG didn't give the players real names in their announcement which made it harder to find information on this guy. If he played for other teams or is on the MMR leaderboard it's under a different ID.   **LGD Gaming**   *Agressif Maybe xiao8 September MMY*    Likely the only really unfamiliar name here is September with both Agressif and Maybe breaking into the pro scene from LGD's CDEC initiative. September joins LGD from CDEC.Avenger - one of their academy teams. CDEC.A notably won the first Chinese open qualifier for the Shanghai major defeating EHOME.KING 2-0 in the final. In the main qualifier this team finished first in their group defeating Wings and Newbee.Y 2-0 and trading with Newbee and CDEC.Y (former CIS game minus Black^). In the next stage they were defeated by IG.V (now IG) and Newbee dropping out of the qualifier.  **Vici Gaming:**   *Burning CTY rOtK HYM jdh*      One of the more 'star studded' teams with veterans Burning and rOtK. CTY got his start in the original Dota 2 roster for Vici Gaming back in 2012 after coming up through the 'VG Esports Academy'. Alongside him on this team were Fy and Fenrir as well as Sydm aka Mikasa who was the only member of the team with competitive experience and would go on to make a big name for himself as a coach. After the team failed to qualify for TI3 it fractured with CTY disappearing from the competitive scene until he reemerged on Team DK's rebuilding squad after their TI4 team went their separate ways. From there he was 'loaned' to EHOME which turned out to be a permanent move.      Both HYM and jdh have played on various T2 Chinese teams. HYM registered with HyperGloryTeam in September last year in the 3 role however he will now be playing support. jdh was one of the original members of Speed Gaming's Chinese squad. From here he played for Wings Gaming with other members of this team after they were released by their organisation. jdh's next move was to join EHOME.KING - one of their two academy teams - where he also played under the ID of hydsb and notably played with former MVP Pheonix TI5 carry kphoenii who joined EHOME.KING following TI5.  **Vici Gaming Reborn:**   *Zyf NoNo Yang Fy DDC*    VG's academy team 'Vici Gaming Potential' has rebranded to Vici Gaming Reborn. Zyf aka YJ aka END has a story that goes back to post TI3 WPC Ace Dota 2 League Season 1. As a part of this team two amateur teams were formed and coached by ACE - the Chinese Esports regulatory body. Zyf played on WPC-A which was picked up by TongFu as an academy team - one of the first of it's kind in China - and was rebranded TongFu WanZhou. This team would go on to lose every single match it played in the league. This was the same tournament where the new DK squad (Burning Mushi Ice3 MMY! Lanm) went 14-0 on the tail end of the 6.78 patch and featured the famous Bo7 comeback in the DK-IG finals with the legendary 3 hour break. I'm not 100% sure on the details but I believe Zyf was actually cut from the team about half way through the league and before it was sponsored by TongFu. Following this he disappeared for a little while but then entered WPC Ace Dota 2 League Season 2 which featured only a single amateur team this time around. Orenda won this competition and Zyf was on it in the offlane role. Perhaps his big break was after TI4 when Vici Gaming bought and dismantled CIS Game keeping Black for itself and selling June to IG. The remainder of this team was rebranded LV Gaming in collaboration with LGD who added Lin aka AllBeautyMustDie and longtime LGD veteran now discarded DDC to the squad. Zyf was the 5th member of this team and played carry. This team would be aquired and developed into the new roster for EHOME where Zyf would achieve Top 6 at TI5. Following this he was sold to Vici Gaming who then acquired Burning resigning the talented youngstar to their academy team.  Yang was first noticed by the western audience when he joined the original incarnation of Vici Gaming Potential in early 2015. In the clubs announcement of the team they state that he previously played for Dream Gaming and was a 'Sina Cup Supernova Champion' from which I can only deduce meant that he was on one of the two teams that qualified to the main event from the 128 team open qualifiers group stage. It seems likely that he played for Ogura Yui as there isn't much information out there about this team although he could have been on New Element (which was also the team that gave Agressif and Shiki their start prior to CDEC's formation). Most of the player names for the open qualifier teams are in Chinese characters which makes it hard for me to track down who he was playing with.  Like September NoNo played for CDEC.A. As far as I know this was the beginning of his career. The only mention I could find of him was on the Chinese MMR leader boards where he places inside the top 20 with ~7100 MMR.   **Newbee** (*Hao Mu xz Kaka ChuaN* )  **EHOME** (*Lanm Old Chicken Eleven Ice3 Fenrir*) and **CDEC** (*Rabbit Super Yao Garder Q*) whilst exciting for their fans don't really contain any unrecognisable names.     **This is largely a work in progress and I'll add more information as I go. If you know something I don't definitely post it in the comments.**,article

Dota 2 10th July Patch  Content Analysis,cyborgmatt.com,,article
An analysis of heroes' speech patterns: what personality data extracted from heroes' own words can tell us about them.,self.DotA2,"**TL;DR: Skeptical heroes who like art and the greater good are best.**   Hey Everyone  **Introduction:**  In past analyses I have focused on the outwardly observable aspects of heroes and how those might affect pick and/or win rates.  The most direct example of [which is seen here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2l2nln/an_analysis_of_facial_attractiveness_in_dota2_are/) where the facial attractiveness of each hero was compared to pick rates.  However looks as they say are not everything.  When Faceless Void respawns are you drawn to his absent-eyed expression or his cultural refinement as evidenced by mastery of simile (Like the sun I rise again.)?   It is reasonable to assume that some subset of the DotA2 community considers personality just as if not more important than appearance.  Therefore the purpose of this study was to extract personality data from each hero and study these data in relation to both win and pick rates.  This presented a challenge--when studying attractiveness the obvious source of data was hero faces; how to collect personality information is less clear.    **Methods:** As it is currently not feasible for heroes to take online personality tests I decided to study personality based on verbal communications.  While what we say to others does not fully represent who we are it is the most accessible usable data for DotA2 heroes.  Therefore every voice line a hero uses in game was collected from the [DotA2 Wiki](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Sniper_responses) and submitted to [IBMs Watson Personality Insight online tool](https://watson-pi-demo.mybluemix.net/) which is described as [a]service [which] uses linguistic analytics to extract a spectrum of cognitive and social characteristics from the text data that a person generates through blogs tweets forum posts and more. The output from this tool gave both quantitative assessments of each heros scores in Big 5 Personality categories but also general descriptions of personality traits based on those scores.  Of note Io and Phoenix were unable to analyzed by this tool due to their inability to produce words.  **Results:** For the full album of all text-based personality reports [please follow this link](http://imgur.com/a/QHAcD).  You will see that each hero has multiple paragraphs describing their characteristics.  In addition to this data I also recorded all of the percentage based quantitative scores an example seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/uDsEYWn.png).  For this initial pilot study of personalities I decided not to try to analyze everything but instead to pick select interesting points of data from multiple points: **1)** the quantitative personality data **2)** the first line of the text report which gives a simple personality explanation for each hero and **3)** the traits listed in the additional sections of text and.  The data below is organized in this manner.  **Results 1: Quantitative personality data.**  Many traits were reported in this data set but I will focus on two: the fiery and hedonism scores.  First I selected heroes that can be described as fiery and compared their fiery scores to that the rest of the hero pool.  The results are summarized below and indicate that overall fire heroes score nearly 5% less in the fiery trait than other heroes.  	   Fire Hero| ""Fiery"" Score ---|---|---- Batrider| 28% Clinkz| 32% Doom| 31% Dragon Knight| 28% Ember Spirit| 25% Huskar| 34% Jakiro| 32% Lina| 23% Ogre Magi| 48% **Average fiery score of fire heroes**| 31.22% **Average fiery score of all other heroes**| 36.07%  It is possible that fire-related heroes are already fiery enough in outward appearance or abilities and thus dont need as fiery of a personality as others who compensate for their lack of outward fire with inward fire.   Of note Ogre Magi is an outlier at a 48% fiery score compared to his other fire heroes which I attribute to the presence of two heads and personalities.  Jakiros two heads do not result in a higher score because one is ice based.  In respect to hedonism scores I took 54 heroes with the highest and 54 heroes with the lowest hedonism percentages and compared the pick rates of the two groups.  Overall I found the group with lower scores were picked at a higher rate (9.81%) than their counterparts with higher hedonism scores (8.60%).  This trend towards picking heroes that are less focused on self-pleasure will be seen again further in this analysis and thus suggests players are more interested in picking heroes who focus on more than themselves.  **Results 2: First line of text report.**  You can appreciate that there are several different characteristics describing heroes in the first line yet many heroes were assigned the same traits.  Two that stood out in particular were shrewd and skeptical.  I noticed that not a single hero was described as both shrewd and skeptical leading one to believe there is some stark contrast between heroes described as shrewd vs skeptical.  Below I compared the two groups' win rates:    Personality type| Number of heroes| Matches played| Matches won| Winning percentage ---|---|----|----|---- Shrewd| 44| 3331208172 | 1652387621 | 50.40% Skeptical| 57| 4642159771 | 2273441372 | 51.03%  I attribute the slightly higher winning percentage of skeptical heroes to one of two things: either the apparent advantage that being doubtful has over cleverness.  Being skeptical of surroundings in DotA2 leads to questioning which leads to smarter team play which may be more of a benefit than over-confidence from being shrewd.  That or statistical chance.    **Results 3: Additional sections of text report.**  There is a lot to sort through in these paragraphs however I chose to focus on two areas.  First I studied 22 heroes that were described as unconcerned with art.  As seen below these 22 had a 1.2% lower winning percentage than all other heroes leading to the conclusion that a lack of appreciation for art correlates with lower hero success.  Personality type| Number of heroes| Matches played| Matches won| Winning percentage ---|---|----|----|---- Heroes unconcerned with art| 22| 1335050650  | 643329781 | 48.20% All other heroes| 86| 7295769497  |3604102078  | 49.40%  Additionally I sought to study any differences between top 10 win/pick rate heroes versus bottom 10 win/pick rate heroes.  Overall I found that in both of the top 10 groups there were significantly more heroes described as preferring activities with a purpose greater than personal enjoyment than the bottom 10s.  Thus I conclude that heroes who put the greater good above themselves are both more desirable to pick and are more suited to win. Data summarized below:         Table| Bottom 10 win rate| Top 10 win rate| Bottom 10 pick rate | Top 10 pick rate ---|---|----|----|---- **Heroes preferring greater purpose**| 1| 6| 1| 7 ^(**Bottom 10 win rate:** Io Oracle Earth Spirit Shadow Demon Morphling Broodmother Lone Druid Puck Anti-mage Enchantress)   ^(**Top 10 win rate:** Abaddon Omniknight Necrophos Zeus Wraith King Warlock Lich Spectre Centaur Warrunner Ursa) ^(**Bottom 10 pick rate:** Oracle Winter Wyvern Chen Visage Elder Titan Earth Spirit Io Phoenix Beastmaster Shadow Demon) ^(**Top 10 pick rate**: Pudge Sniper Phantom Assassin Juggernaut Invoker Axe Riki Mirana Bloodseeker Drow Ranger)  The presence of Io and Phoenix in the bottom 10 groups is notableheroes without obvious personalities are likely less relatable and thus picked less.  **Conclusions:** Overall this pilot study just scratched the surface of available personality data. Additional studies for a more in-depth look are encouraged (if anyone would like the raw data PM me and I can send it along!) However it is clear that certain traits have an effect on both hero pick and win rates.  Thank you for reading and I look forward to your comments. ",article
Why Valve must take the situation in hand on the cosmetics controversy and why this will never happen.,self.DotA2,"**PREAMBLE**: First of all i want to clarify that i tend to be pungent and sarcastic but this will serve to point out what is truly important to me. I hope you will focus on the validity of the arguments and will contribute to the discussion constructively. Also i hope to receive enough material from your comments in order to make a report as much as possible complete which can summarizes the different points of view of the community.  Criticism is always appreciated and incouraged but please keep the discussion serious and constructive.  Also English is not my native language but i tried to write as clearly as possible have mercy!  **SHORT STORY**: As I think we all know Valve has (not so) recently succumbed to various temptations releasing for those whom the lore and aesthetic features that characterizes Dota from every other game counts questionable Sets who break the lore and the aesthetic of the game/character in various ways.  **CONTROVERSIAL SETS**:   **[Alpine Ursa Set] (http://www.pcgamesn.com/sites/default/files/Alpine%20Ursa.jpg)**: A fiery ursine tribe warrior is cosplaying a cowboy. Maybe it wanted to result a german yodeler but it still looks like a cowboy fit to me.  Does not respect: Colour scheme (Pink neon shirt) Silhouette (Cowboy hat) Lore (Cowboys are related to far west not dota nor ursine tribes nor Ursa past present or future).   **[Dread of the Gleaming Seal PA Set] (http://www.dota2.com/store/itemdetails/20306)**: no longer has a one handed blade but a two handed scythe. Does not respect Silhouette and Pose.  How Valve made that set legit as CyborgMatt stated in a recent article: *""Due to the nature of shape of the Scythe used in the Alliance branded Loda set for PA we have some new animations for idle attacking and loadout for the Dread of the Gleaming Seal set.""*  **Nyx Assassin**:  Some users stated that the Alpha Predator Set seems to be problematic on low details graphics because it seems that Spiked Carapace is always active.  **[NaVi Qop Set](http://www.dota2.com/store/itemdetails/20213)**: no longer has a dagger but a mace (her first ability is dagger based) no more a crown but a helmet. Does not respect her Silhouette. This set was controversial especially because NaVi designers were starting to work on more controversial sets like the [AM one] (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=153775758) or the [Dazzledemon one] (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=181636596).  **[Gifts of the Shadowcat Drow Set] (http://www.dota2.com/store/itemdetails/20316)**: a deadly ranger is now cosplaying a cute Cat. Does not respect: Colour scheme (Pink details instead of different shades of blue) Silhouette (Cat ears are for cats or human cosplayers not for drow rangers) and Lore (*Lithe and stealthy icy hot she moves like mist in silence. That whispering you hear is her frozen arrows finding an enemy's heart. Stealth silence subtlety.*) Does that description collide with a cute purring pinky cat? If I were drow ranger grew up with humans but always stranger to them and more likely drows I would not have braided my hairs in a such feminine manner nor I would have used pink laces to do so nor I would have put on myself animal remains to result cute but to result scary. I am still wondering where can I find a pinky shadowcat.  **COMMUNITY ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE RECENT CHANGES**:  * Valve gave the community the Guidelines and those have to be respected in order to preserve the identification of the heroes in game  http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/workshop/Dota2CharacterArtGuide.pdf  * Every set must be compatible with the lore in order to preserve the unique nature and coherence of every hero  http://www.dota2.com/workshop/requirements  * *""The aesthetics of Dota 2 are build from a set of principles that help keep each hero immediately and uniquely identifiable. It is important that the set remain **artistically consistent with the original design**."" (Valve)*  * Dota must preserve his nature and his design without become the next TF2 or LoL in order to preserve is own life.  * The release of Cat-Drow Ranger is now launching a new LoL-like trend which tends to stereotype the characters ignoring their personalities. Designs like [this one] (https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/q71/1012764_761305060552352_1218924063_n.jpg) who transform the aggressive and proud Lina into a cute sailor moon or even a foxfire Ahri version are now taking place   **COMMUNITY CONTRA ARGUMENTS**:  * The point about QoP's mace being bad because of her ""dagger based skill"" is a stretch. Almost every tidehunter set changes his anchor but he still uses ANCHOR SMASH. Same goes for Axe.  * the workshop is such a pain to navigate and vote in that I personally don't bother  * If you dont like it dont buy it  * Without changing the colors and the shape we cant have original and distinctive sets  * Sponsored items help Esport and Pro players/teams so it is legit to be more accommodative with that  * The majority of the community voted for it  * Cat ears make drow more unique and special  * I dont care about cosmetics as the game is f2p  * I love ursa cowboy set there is nothing wrong with it  * Make a chinese themed set for every hero is a good compromise to expand the market of dota 2 in the east  * Dota 2 is not a RPG game I dont care about the lore  * The only problem with the items is the loophole allowing almost anything bundled with a ticket or affiliated with an entity into the game.   **PERSONAL TOUGHTS**:  As most of you understood I do not wish a deconstructuralization of the characters in a pure commercial way. This is one of the main reason that made Dota 2 a special game so original that doesnt need to push on stereotypes like LoL.  The way we took (not so) recently is demeaning all this.  I know they are only cosmetics but if you guys reflect a bit you will agreed with me that we got more people interested in this than players interested in the game. And this is making our game experience even worst. I also left LoL because i really felt it childish and visually boring (big boobs and cute designs for every female character who transform them in a continuous sexual recall) and i really dont wanna leave dota for the same reason.  **Minor changes of base models**  I remember the **portrait change** of Lina and WR or even Mirana to push some huge boobs into the screen. Is this not sad for you? Are you really fine with transforming even WR? I mean she was special different sometimes less is better.  I would also clarify that I am in any way a fkn feminist as someone of you stated. I dont wanna put a burqa on QoP I love her! And i love the naive blonde CM or the fiery Lina as much as I love other particular characters that are not so much feminine such as PA or Spectre. Those ones are the most interesting and particular to me. And I think that diversity is a  valor that must be preserved. This is my only point with that sexualization thing. It is ok to have sexualized chars and it is good to also have something different. Same goes with male characters. We have AM and we have Waifustealer. We HAD Pudge. We will lose Lifestealer a day? I really hope not.   **Idea for the Workshop**: an initial screening from Valve to decide what respects the guidelines and what not. So we can prevent the tons of garbage that is now present and we can also prevent bad trends. But more important: we can make the workshop **easier to navigate**. There is no reason to keep a spoon for Sven. If we decrease the amount of superfluous material more users will be glad to vote.  **My personal Idea of distinctive set**:  [DK Father of Dragons] (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=165683781)   [QoP Wicked Succubus] (http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4zun0xlE8pk/UZbt_Z0B5sI/AAAAAAAAAXw/V3EqKahYbhA/s1600/ingame.jpg)  No need to break anything to be original and distinctive.  I want also to say that this post brought mainly cosmetics examples BUT it is way to put your attention on a fact: that the philosophy behind the game is changing and the minor changes to some base models are a sign of that new trend. This way i predict that in the future the game will be made easier for novices removing certain mechanics who made it more difficoult. I am talking about absurd but *1984 from Orwell* was absurd too at his time.   **CONCLUSION AND QUESTIONS:** Why is the sexualization and the stereotyping AND the lore-	incoherence the ONLY way to make Dota 2 remunerative? Is this really the only way? Are you ok or even happy with that changes? Where do those changes will lead us in the near future?  Thanks for reading!   Edit: I am constantly adding your toughts to the contra arguments so they can result more consistent. thank you!

An analysis of teeth in DotA2: do visible chompers influence pick rate?,self.DotA2,Hey everyone  Lets clear the air and talk about the elephant in the room.  Im not talking about Cthulhuphant (you remember that thing from HoN right?  Another bastardized creation from the people that brought you Beardulon or The Learnatoriumbut I digress).  If youre anything like me you know that choosing a hero has its fair share of challenges.  Youll look at what your teammates have already picked and scan the board for something yourself.  That one could be good but what about him?  Maybe if we have her supportwait this one is even better.  **But oh God look at his teeth.**  Teeth.  We all have them.  Or most people do at least one or two if not the full set.  Humans have become reasonably accustomed to teeth; smiles somehow became a social norm.  But I think deep down in all of us there is a fear of seeing anothers teeth.  More often than not baring teeth in the animal kingdom is a warning to induce fear.  This fear still lingers in our DNA a gift from our ancestors and previous branches on the evolutionary tree.  **Which begs the question; are we wary of picking heroes who have their teeth showing in hero portraits?**  Table 1| Strength| Agility| Intelligence| Total ---|---|----|----|---- **All heroes with exposed teeth**| 17| 11| 17| 45 **Dire heroes with exposed teeth**| 10| 9| 12| 31   To begin to look at this question lets look at what kind of hero shows their teeth in the first place.  From the table above we can see that out of all 110 heroes 45 have exposed teeth.  Of those 45 31 are Dire.  In regards to hero class both 17 Strength and Intelligence heroes show teeth while only 11 Agility heroes do the same.  In each class the Dire dominates dental displaying numbers: 10/17 Strength 9/11 Agility and 12/17 Intelligence heroes come from the north side of the map.  Therefore I conclude that **heroes that are evil (from the Dire) are more likely to bare their teeth in hero portraits.**  Now lets jump to the crux of the issue and look at the two big questions. 1) Are heroes showing teeth less likely to be picked than those that do not?  And 2) which group is more likely to win?  The table below tells the tale.  **On average heroes that do not have exposed teeth are picked at a 5% higher rate on than their counterparts.**  These data promisingly hint that fear of teeth play a part on the picking screen although further data collection and analysis will be needed to draw any conclusions.  That being said heroes with chompers out have a slightly higher win rate although not significantly higher by any means (< 1%).      Table 2| Heroes with exposed teeth| Heroes without exposed teeth ---|---|---- **Total number of heroes**| 44*| 64* **Total number of times played**| 2379414307| 3637702842 **Average number of times played**| 54077597.89| 56839106.91 (+5.10% higher) **Average win rate**| 49.10%| 48.45%  ^Data ^taken ^from ^all-time ^statistics ^on ^Dotabuff.com.  ^*Winter ^Wyvern ^and ^Oracle ^excluded ^from ^exposed ^and ^without ^exposed ^teeth ^respectively ^due ^to ^recent ^introduction.  In summary the data presented here suggest **bared teeth may be an important aspect of the hero portrait which influence players picks.**  Further independent and in-depth studies will be needed to validate this hypothesis.  Thank you for reading and I look forward to your personal anecdotes and opinions.  TL;DR: You might be afraid of teeth. ,article

Burning: New iG has vibrant environment good chemistry. I intend to get married next year. (Translated),self.DotA2,By Burning  original article by ImbaTV  http://www.imbatv.cn/special/xinsheng/11/  TI6 qualifier was my last match on VG squad we lost and I was lost. I finally recovered from that and did full coverage of TI6 along side Rotk. Looking back it was a rough time but it was ok after all. I was a bit lost and disappointed: after so many years since TI2 it was my first time not making it to Seattle. The failure prompted me to play carry for another year a position Im used to because I was not contempt of loosing playing a position Im not that familiar with.   After so many years of relationship with Rotk I feel hes still a great captain. He will arrange the detail of each position from a draft and strategic point making it easy for us to play through the games. Maybe he isnt the best in the core mechanics of Dota compared to other top offlaners in China in terms of hero pool mechanics and game sense. In our training and daily life Rotk unites the whole team in his ways. For example when we lost a game we would get mad at the heat of the moment which lead communication failure and even bad argument. Rotk would only talk about the issue itself with his own way of wording making us wish to improve together.   After TI6 Rotk was planning to retire and the only team member remaining on the VG squad was HYM. I wasnt too excited to play on such squad. When Fenrir left ehome he convinced Rotk to play another year making a new team. But I think their style might not be the one I would fit in. At the time there were not many teams left so I came to IG when I got their offer.   The new iG squad is 2 veteran + 3 new stars. Regarding our chemistry we are at a good position. Maybe its because we only formed not long ago and many problems havent surfaced yet. If it was like the old times a team with too many veterans would have many problems such as lack of passion and strive. Right now we have passion to say the least. We still have many things remains to be fixed: our strategy is lacking our in-game response is still bad we need to continue working and accumulate our experience through matches.   My play style has been shifting now. I used to play to the extremes of fighting or farming. After my support experience in this half-year I feel my read on the game and my balance on fighting and farming have improved. Our mid player op (Chinese username: marine) is a farming mid I would get fighting carries like Naix to create farming space for him letting him to be that infinite fat Carry in late game. On one hand our roles are determined by the patch on the other hand they are also determined by our individual capability: Op is a extremely good mid.   As the oldest player in the team I still might be the iconic player in others eyes while xxs and op are truly shining in our games. As a veteran I would pass on the experience to them. I would watch replays through their player perspective and tell them what should and shouldnt be done helping them accumulate experience in various situations in the games.   My teammates all have distinct personalities. Op (Marine) this guys talks a LOT and hes funny. He cant rest for a day just being the best lubricant of team chemistry. The only thing he needs to work on is his hero pool. Our offlaner XXS: a very young very strong player. He has his unique understanding of game prompt initiation good mechanics and attention to details. Its a pleasure playing with him. Our position 4 support Boboka: Hes quiet almost a complete opposite to OP. But he is strong and understand the game to a great depth overall a very down-to-earth player. Our position 5 support Q the TI5 2nd place support our drafter. When I draft I get lost sometimes forget many things and easily distracted by my teammates suggestions. Q considers almost every aspect of drafting. He also discuss with us during drafting filtering out our gibberish this is golden for a drafter. Our team manager ZaiZai he was the manager for TI6 champ Wings. His success has a reason: he managed our training to almost perfect.   I understand Hao & Mus retirement completely. Nowadays players need to balance training match and streaming including the daily pubs to maintain their form. You only have so much time and the pressure from the fans would finally get to you. There used to be a time forums and comments are mostly encouragement or pure discussion of the game. Now its just people flame for the sake of flaming. If a player played badly maybe he would be flamed till he quits. Im now used to all these jazz and no longer concerns the pure flames. But some of the newer players might still be affected by the flaming which would subsequently affect their competition. You get tired from mind to body at some point. I took a break as well but I still cant rest completely and competed in DAC.   Regarding the incident of Puppey Ive got to know a thing or two. I am not close to Puppey so I wouldnt make too many comments. But if the allegations are true it must be accumulated over time. The more titles and fame you get the more arrogant you get then you would do such things making yourself violent. Ive heard EHOME has professional psychologist for counseling. I think as E-sports continues to develop psychological counseling is necessary and helpful in the long run.   Our next tournament is Nanyang then Major. We will try our best. We are gelling as a team fast after the shuffle. If we would be playing the Major qualifier tomorrow we should be able to win. But other teams would improve in the mean time. Right now in the scene there are many small tournaments and they are replacing our scrims. We are in the mind set to use these small tournaments to practice and round up our strategy. I feel the pressure is mostly on the big tournaments such as the Major. I predict the strong teams in Chinese scene will include LGD: their recent performance is good and they have some stacked line-up. EHOME: Their performance has ups and downs they win brilliantly yet they loose in the most strange manner but when a big tournament comes up you can always put your bet in them to get results; Wings Theyve been taking a break and their games right now are probably attempts to develop new strats. Its common for them to loose but they sure have the power in them. In terms of strong teams in foreign regions EG as they just won MDL. Basically they are regarded as the No.1 in raw talent. But as of now many teams are recovering from the reshuffle. Some new teams still need time to develop their strategy and experiment. You cant judge their success from the current results time will tell.   Since Oct 2008 it has been 9 years Ive accumulated some fans. Someone asked my why I get liked by many people yet I dont have the answer. Maybe its because of my honesty. After playing for so many years one will always get some fans and fame. The fame doesnt cause me trouble in my daily life. The occasional encounters with random fans on the street only cost a minutes saying Hi taking pictures and its done. Fans are rational. At first when I got many fans I didnt become arrogant instead I put much pressure on myself to meet the fans expectation. For example in 2011 we had many wins in 2010 then for the first half of 2011 we didnt have anything. I felt immense pressure through out the year even after we started wining in the later half of the year. Now Im playing with a calm heart long as I dont leave any regret. Maybe Wings would face these pressures that burdening their heart but its just a process in progressing.   Regarding the picture where Wings standing behind me in WPC its not like we were teaching them. I remember I was testing my machine at the time and they were just back there. All their results came from their hard work. The championship run by Wings proves their power. I think outside influence such as brackets and sort only accounts for 20% of your chance to winning the rest 80% is on yourself. Wings is the truly deserving Champion.   Q&A  Q: Who is the better poker player in Doudizhu (A chinese poker translate to fight the landlord) you or Rotk?  A: Its unquestionable for people who watch our stream I rekt him.   Q: Who is the better drinker you or Sylar?  A: 50/50.   Q: Do you know why your nick name Xu di lei (di lei: land mine) come from (Burnings Chinese name is Xu zhi lei zhi lei -> di lei is a small word play by substituting the mid character with another character to construct new words in this case land mine also pictures burning lying rolling over the ground when drunk)?   A: I heard theres this one time after I drink I was rolling all over the ground maybe there was something like that once. But Sylar did that too sometimes he rolls sometims I roll.   Q: When are you planning to get married?  A: Maybe next year.   Q: Anything funny to share in the iG team?   A: Op really talks a LOT. He bluffs a lot after winning then Q and I would fight him (in dota). OP is mechanically strong but this young guy sometimes does things makes us old folks baffle. He would pretend his hero to be the illusion to hit tower and feed; Selling arcane boots when he actually want to dissemble arcane boots for bloodstone; If I want to make apology to the fans I usually use OPs weibo account to post; XXS is the pillar of our team when we were playing great we call him fork brother (X in chinese also can be pronounced as the word for fork) when we underperform we call him forklift. These nicknames are all made up by OP. Q is another interesting guy hes bit fat so hes determined to loose weight. He would run for half an hour after our scrims then order a huge dinner to compensate his efforts.   Q: What does the 10 yuan per bottle means in your practice room?  A: I BOUGHT THOSE WATER THEN THEY ALL TAKE LIKE WHATEVER SO I HAVE TO WRITE THIS DOWN.   Q: What would you do after retire?  A: Probably will stay in the scene maybe get Rotk to cast together.   Q: Any words for the fans?  A: Thank everyone for their care  and support I hope you can turn your attention to my games visit my stream if you have time.   Q: Any words for the flamers?  A: If flaming me can make you happy its not bad.  ,article

Dota 2 27th March Patch  Content Analysis,cyborgmatt.com,,article
In defense of Viper and his wings.,self.DotA2,As most people can notice Viper's wings appear to be facing the wrong direction as they sweep forward rather than backwards. As we all know it to be all wings; birds bats insects etc. face backwards. This allows them to easily maneuver in the air and allows for simple effective lift. This is also seen in Dota where Jakiro Winter Wyvern Batrider and such all have the characteristic back-swept wings. Viper easily sticks out as some awkward mistake amongst the other fliers.  But here's the thing the design of Viper's unique wings could easily be the result of evolutionary adaptation. What we know of Viper is that he is a Netherdrake. The species was sealed off for millions of years in the luminous subterranean caverns of the Nether Reaches. Caves are likely to curve at random points taper off and contain various rock formations. They also may have low wide ceilings as well as tall thin passages.  Various noted advantages of a forward-swept wing involve better maneuverability in various circumstances. The two main points are allowing for a much higher angle of attack and being more controllable at low or supersonic speeds. With forward wings craft are able to easily maintain 65 angles without stalling. A second significant advantage is that the shape of the wings reduces drag by moving air towards the center of the unit. The forward wings also shift the center of gravity allowing huge G shifts in short periods of time.  So how does this help a Netherdrake such as Viper? The various maneuverability bonuses are incredibly useful when flying about a cave. Standard wings require much more space to pull off evasive maneuvers such as loops rolls and various turns. This also assists in projecting his toxins which are incredibly potent for hunting prey.  Able to change directions very easily he can force prey and indeed any potential predator into a disastrous trajectory avoidable only with forward-swept wings.   More clues exist when examining Viper's head and facial structure. Viper's jaw is structured in such a way that his lower jaw projects outwards past his upper jaw. Upon slamming his jaw shut it is more likely to catch upon the underside of the object. As a result he is easily able to chase a prey in ascent and grasp it in his mouth. Also look at his eye orientation. His head slants back and on each side are a pairs of eyes. One pair is forward facing while the other is angled on the side somewhat upwards. Using the pair in conjunction Viper is able to watch the air above him while also observing the terrain in front of him. All of these points lead to Viper being a low-flying hunter which approaches prey from below.  Also note the claws adorning the front of Viper's wings. Viper with his flat body shape can easily approach a foe from below and rip at their wings with such claws. Such a design would be unfeasible on a standard wing. One must also consider that Viper lacks any lower limbs. Creatures such as Jakiro and Winter Wyvern are capable of walking when not in flight. As flight is Viper's sole mode of locomotion the reduced drag created by the forward-swept wings reduces the amount of energy needed to maintain flight.  All of these characteristics are thus potentially very useful in the environment the Netherdrakes evolved in. The unique wing shape is further supported in his lore. It is said their cave was sealed away from the outside for millions of years. This would isolate the Netherdrakes from any other external species allowing this unique trait to arise in Viper's population. He is a specialized hunter shaped by millions of years of evolution into a top subterranean killer.   ______________________  tl;dr: Viper's wings are specially formed to give him an edge in aerial combat despite how strange they may look.   P.S. Valve please go back and touch-up Viper's model evolution really is not an excuse for low-quality modelling. The textures of course should be updated as well. Thanks.,article

6.82 Comeback mechanic is awesome but for whom?,self.DotA2,"Some things i'm noticing after the patch and the ensuing storm on this sub:  * It's silly to say that you ""earned a comeback"" through ""better play & decision-making"" when there is a comeback mechanic specifically designed to allow you to have a chance to get back in the game no matter what happens.   * This caters to the bad players that didn't know *what they did in the early game had consequences later.*  Is it fair for them to not give a shit about early game just because ""cumback mechanic""? The bounty change just perpetuates what bad players did before which was not care that *misplays/feeding could possibly lead to a struggle in the late game.*  * You don't deserve a comeback just because you kill off a carry who's been feeding off your mistakes throughout the game  * There's an ugly trend on this sub where people pat themselves on the back after feeding the enemy a large advantage and then thinking they **deserve cumback** because of one kill on a streaking player.   * Current trench mentality: ""They made one mistake and I'm finally able to kill them them! That should make up for all the other mistakes I made all game!""   I'll brave the downvotes but I feel there's an influx of new players and vocal-majority trench players passing off this mechanic that caters to them as them ""deserving these new cumback wins.""   notes:  tomakak_fanboy [wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2hjsxi/682_comeback_mechanic_is_awesome_but_for_whom/cktdjap) >It also assumes that all teams will use gold equally and that a team's total net worth is indicative of that team's absolute strength.  and then hoobacious [expanded](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2hjsxi/682_comeback_mechanic_is_awesome_but_for_whom/cktfqr9) >Thank you for perfectly putting into words what I've unsuccessfully been trying to express. Total net worth is thoroughly not indicative of team strength. Both teams having 50k gold net worth does not indicate both are as powerful as one another and yet that's at the core of the logic for this patch.  Edit:  I got GREAT feedback thanks I was losing hope that all of reddit were brainless sheep.  But now that [the pros have spoken](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2hkiur/looks_like_the_pros_dont_seem_to_be_receiving_the/) it looks like reddit circle jerk is about to change it's tune.
