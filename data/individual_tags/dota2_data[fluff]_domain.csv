Have you lost your PC in Auckland?|self.DotA2|~Hi DOTA players. I am the IT manager for a shopping centre in Auckland, New Zealand. I have been handed a PC that was found in the bushes at work here and even though the CPU and RAM are gone, the rest appears to be intact including a GTX 680 vid card, case, mobo, and 1TB hdd. We are assuming that it was stolen not abandoned.

I have gone though the fairly clean hdd and the only piece of identifying info on it was the steam account and the guy plays DOTA and has reddit as a favorite website so I am hoping to catch him here somehow.

I have sent a friend request to his private account and been denied so I am running out of options.

If you recently had your PC stolen and believe you are the guy that owns this hardware can you contact me please?

Support circle jerk: You are Dazzle.|self.DotA2|~All Pick begins. You ban Axe because you are Dazzle. You chat to your team, "I will support." You don't care about the rest of the picks because Axe is banned and you are Dazzle. You know you will solo support because it is 1.5k, even though there is a Riki on the other team. Your teammates pick their heroes. Sven. Slardar. Obviously Pugna mid. Obviously LC jungle. You load into the game. You buy courier and both wards. You buy tangos and a clarity. You give your mid two tangos because it is 1.5k and you do not want him to feed. You want to win.

You are Dazzle, so the laning stage is going well, even though you have spent all your money on sentries. Sven has not died yet. You are returning to bottom lane after a rotation when Sven is ganked under enemy T1 tower. "Report Dazzle no grave" he writes in all chat. You don't respond because you are Dazzle. You don't acknowledge flame. You make a mental note to skill Shallow Grave next to increase its cast range. You are Dazzle and you have one job. Your job is not tilting or flaming. Your job is winning.

The next carry to die is your offlane Slardar. "team?" he types in chat. You do not respond, even though you called missing on both bot and middle lanes. You are Dazzle. You also do not mute your team because you are Dazzle and they need you. Even when mid Pugna says in all chat "this dazzle" and "just abandon" you do not mute him. Pugna isn't having a good game, you say to yourself. But you can fix that if you don't tilt. Because you are Dazzle and you want to win.

"wrads" says LC after dying in enemy secret shop, where a ward had been dewarded just a minute ago. "wrads" "ward" "wards" "wrad" "ward" Enemy Riki affected by +10 duel damage. You don't flame, even though the enemy team is dewarding everything you have with Riki and Zeus and wards are out of stock. It is just 65 gold. 15 minutes into the game you have brown boots, magic stick, and wards. You look at the energy booster in your quickbuy. 900 gold. You replace it with sentries.

The enemy is taking down your T2 tower in top lane. "b" you type in chat. Slardar has muted you already. He turns on Sprint and runs into 4 enemy heroes, looking for a solo ultra kill. You do not flame because you are Dazzle. You TP top and Shallow Grave Slardar. The enemy team begins to dive for the kill but it is too late. Slardar is too fast. Your team is TPing in. Warhammer. God's Strength. Weave. Enemy heroes are melting as Weave gets stronger. Duel goes off. LC affected by +10 duel damage. Enemies are dead but Pugna still sucking. Its a team wipe. You don't gloat because you are Dazzle. You know it is still 9-6 in the enemy's favor. You just ping the tower but your carries are already going back into the jungle. You do not flame them because Dazzle likes to win.

LC finally begins to win duels. She almost loses one but you are there for the Shallow Grave. LC says nothing and returns to the jungle. Meanwhile Sven takes down the T2 bot. "Well Played!" you say. Pugna is still flaming but you still do not mute him because Dazzle wants to win. "0-8-11 dazzle" he types in all chat. "lmao" "arcane boots and wand at 40 min" "report" 45 minutes into the game LC is finally ready to stop farming. "> Blademail: Ready" he announces. You do not flame him. You are happy he is ready to fight. 

With Shallow Grave LC never loses another duel. You pick up your pipe, your first item after Arcanes. Your team goes down middle lane, as 5 for the first time. Dazzle is happy. Dazzle likes to be as 5. Sven is bashing into the T3 mid. The enemy team takes the bait. LC blinks in, immediate duel win. Affected by +160 duel damage. Weave. God's Strength. Even Nether Ward gets a kill when Zeus ults. Enemy team is wiped again. You notice the flame starting in the other direction now. "gg" says the enemy Zeus. "finish fast" "trash Riki" "no support"

The enemy mid rax are down. The T4s start to make that delicious crumbling noise. You know the end is near. Ancient is exposed. Enemy begins to respawn, so you Weave again. LC walks into enemy fountain but you do not flame. You ping the ancient because you want to win. You Shallow Grave LC when he almost dies from fountain shots. +170 duel damage. The ancient goes down. "report dazzle" says Pugna on the post-game screen. "report dazzle" agrees Sven. "1-9-18" 

Your heart hurts but you don't respond. Because you are Dazzle, and you won.

6x Iron Branch should combine to give Iron Tree...|self.DotA2|~...which gives 6 to all stats.

Many heroes buy Iron Branch but nobody buys it after earlygame. I think this suggestion will make it a better midgame item because for 300g you can get 6 to all stats which is definitely not too strong especially compared to like bracer which only costs a bit more and gives a bit less.

But then it's still just a 300g item, so maybe 6x Ironwood Tree can combine to give Iron Forest, which give 36 to all stats, for 1800g, which is pretty efficient for a midtier item. It's only a bit stronger than Skadi afterall and only costs a bit less.
 
And 6x Ironwood Tree should combine to give Ironwood Forest, 6x of which should give Ironwood Jungle, which gives 216 all stats for 10800g, which allows it to be a really good lategame item, giving barely less HP than 4 Heart and only costs a bit less.

Since it has been confirmed that Kaya + Yasha + Sange, as well as Aether Lens + Kaya is definitely a thing next patch, I think Iron Branch needs some love too.^kappa^kappa^flair^checks^out^it's^a^trap~|fluff
Defense of the Ancients 2 is my favorite video game.|self.DotA2|~Defense of the Ancients 2 is my favorite video game. It is a free-to-play game created and maintained by the Valve Corporation, which is headquartered in Bellevue, Washington and ruled by the legendary Gabe Logan Newell. Defense of the Ancients 2 (DotA2) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) in which each of ten players (two teams of five players each) take control of ten heroes to do battle and fulfill objectives on a roughly-symmetrical playing field. The game is routinely praised for being unforgivingly strategic and nearly impossible to master. Players seeking any level of success must be nimble of hand, cunning of mind, and, perhaps most importantly, completely void of human emotion: when two warriors lock eyes on the battlefield, be they the armorclad Dragon Knight, the enigmatic Juggernaut, the unrelenting Bloodseeker, or the mischievous faerie-dragon Puck, all mercy must be put aside. The best teams do not only destroy their opponents, though that is an important part: the best teams humiliate their enemies, casting them down like broken-winged birds into the losers pit of shame amidst an unceasing stream of ridicule and scorn. In a sense it is not a battle of heroes: it is a battle of egos where the most resilient emerges the victor. 

I, having accrued nearly two thousand matchmaking points, am unusually good, and with my signature hero, the Sniper, I have sown violence and death across thousands of battlefields. Regarding items, I start with a Butterfly. Providing massive bonuses to agility, attack speed, and evasion, it is, by a wide margin, the best item in the game. I usually stay mid lane and farm gold until I finish it, typically around minute 40, at which point I will start roaming and ganking. After netting a few kills I will purchase Mask of Madness to improve my attack speed and mobility. Some people prefer Boots of Speed as their mobility item, but in my opinion, only the dimmest of dimwits rely on passive effects: a truly skilled player (like me) can utilize active effects to greater result. Not to mention the Boots of Speed have no offensive capabilities whatsoeverneither attack damage, attack speed, or agility. One could argue that the upgraded Boots of Speed (called Power Treads) remedies this problem, but I would counter-argue that the passive 30 increased attack speed granted by the Power Treads pales in comparison to the Mask of Madnesss active attack speed bonus of 100. It is painfully obvious which is betteryet still I am routinely disappointed by just how many players refuse to buy the Mask of Madness. Passive effects are the bane of my online existence.~|fluff

Its not BONUS gold.

In Dota Allstars, you all started with 825 gold, all 5 of you.

And then every hero cost 200 gold, so if you want to select spesific hero, you have to BUY it for 200 gold, or you can random it for free.

so stop saying this as BONUS, because its not.~|fluff

ISP: "Oh, I see the issue here, Dota 2 isn't included in your Gaming package."

You: "Then how do I play my game?!"

ISP: Well you could subscribe to the unlimited internet package which is only an extra hundred dollars a month, or I see here in my database that League of Legends is a popular "mooo-bah", that is included in your package, you could play that instead. It says here it's the most popular one with over 100 million players, wouldn't you rather play that?"

The Chinese Perspective on the 2GD Drama: Why GabeN's hand might have been forced|self.DotA2|~**Warning: Long post ahead**

In the last few days there's been a lot of commentary and speculation on the 2GD drama. One thing that's been missing is the Chinese perspective, which I've seen some people ask for but hasn't been provided. I'll try to give an overview (I am currently living in Shanghai).

I think the fact that this controversy happened in China is important to understanding why thing played out the way they did. A lot of what I'm going to say is speculation, just because nobody knows all the fact right now. But I don't think most people on /r/dota2 get how different China is even with past drama with Chinese tournaments. There's a thread on the front page right now about "Chris Rock made memey jokes at the Oscars, same thing as 2GD right?" Completely ignores that one is in USA and one is in China.

I looked on Weibo and Tieba to gauge the average Chinese netizens' reaction to the controversy (one unrelated thing you guys may find interesting that I'd forgotten about, the Chinese nickname for GabeN is Fat G). Anyway, the most common reaction was "Who the hell is 2GD", as you might expect. However, the second most common reaction was different variations of **"He was hosting the show and made a sex joke? Serves him right, of course he was fired."**

China's government tightly controls all media in the country, and one of the most longstanding rules is the near-complete ban on sexual content and pornography. Basically all porn is blocked on the internet. James's opening joke on the first day was possibly the worst you could think of. Not only did he reference porn and masturbation, he talked about circumventing the government internet blocks in order to watch porn. While he was in China. In front of a camera talking into a microphone.

The Shanghai Major is a pretty big deal, when I found out they got the Mercedez-Benz Arena for the finals I was actually very surprised. Its where the World Expo was in 2010, and where big international music stars do concerts. It's like Staples Center in LA or Madison Square Garden in NYC. It's bigger than KeyArena by any measure. I remember a huge Taylor Swift concert being held there last year.

So yeah, it's a pretty big deal and Valve/Perfect World most likely had to do a LOT of negotiating and utilize a great deal of [guanxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanxi) in order to get this confirmed. 

Now imagine Gabe's reaction when he hears about this at Valve HQ. "James did what??" Granted, as we know Gabe didn't know about Icefrog telling James to be himself which is definitely a breakdown in communications at Valve. But again, James made one of the worse jokes you could make, basically making a sex joke and subverting the Chinese government joke in the same sentence, the moment after Gabe puts him in front of a camera. At this point Gabe didn't yet fire him, but he was definitely on two strikes. This is speculation, but I'd imagine the "bottom bitch" comment was the last straw. Seems pretty innocuous in the USA, but it does have sexual connotations.

I want to note at this point that I'm no prude and most (young) Chinese people aren't either. I, like James, use methods to get around the internet blocks to access certain forbidden sites. But nobody talks about it, that's just how the culture is, and nobody would dare talk about it in front of a camera. I have a (white American) friend who was an exchange student in China two years ago, and he made a minor masturbation joke in his Chinese class at a Beijing university. His teacher, a girl who I also know, was shocked speechless for 2 minutes. This girl isn't a prude either and goes clubbing on weekends but my point is that in China you just. don't. talk about sex in any sort of "official" setting.

In this kind of culture, James' actions came across as a boorish ignorant tourist. Except he was a boorish ignorant tourist with a mic in front of a camera. I like James' content and I've been watching GD Studio for a long time. But it was clear that James has no conception of how whats acceptable to say on-air is different in the USA/UK and China.

So Gabe has a decision to make, not just for the group stage, but the main stage. Group stage was more low-key, but I think Gabe ultimately decided he didn't want to run the risk of James making another sex joke while sitting on the main stage in the Mercedes-Benz center. Again, this is the biggest entertainment venue in the biggest city in China - I can almost guarantee the Shanghai municipal government officials will be monitoring the Main Event in some way. One more sex joke on the main stage and there's a lot of bad blood between Valve and Chinese officials, and Valve's access to a huge chunk of the Dota2 playerbase just got a helluva lot more difficult. 

James' "bottom bitch" comment was probably interpreted by Gabe as "well either he didn't get my NO MORE SEX JOKES message or he's intentionally defying it" and led to the "James is an ass" comment. For the record, I'm not saying I agree with Gabe's comment, but I'm trying to explain (as much for myself as for anybody else) what might have led to that comment.

Thanks for reading, and I welcome any comments, especially from any other Chinese people who might be browsing this sub, see if I missed anything.

**EDIT**: To address one of the most common comments on this thread - Yeah, hosting a major in China definitely brings a shit ton of problems. I'm not going to make a judgment on whether Valve should or shouldn't have one in China in the future. It was definitely Valve's fault in regard to the Icefrog miscommunication and not prepping James beforehand. However, I will also say that IMO last year's DAC was a pretty successful large-scale tournament in China, and as many people have said, Valve probably hoped the Shanghai Major would basically be DAC but even better. That obviously hasn't happened with the KeyTV P R O D U C T I O N V A L U E + 2GD Drama

**EDIT 2: REGARDING THE "NOBODY IN CHINA EVEN WATCHES ENGLISH STREAM WTF" ARGUMENT:**

I acknowledged that most Chinese dota watchers don't watch English stream and don't know who 2GD is. However, there are those who do, and some of those who do post the news on social media sites, just like how people find out news about Burning, rotK, LaNm, xiao8 here on /r/dota2. Would probably not be a good look for Valve in China if even a few Chinese social media sites started talking about a Valve host making dirty jokes in the Benz arena. ~|fluff esports

So please, don't kill so many Axes while waiting for your queue.~|fluff

Feels. Good. Man.|self.DotA2|~In my last game, I met a guy that 5th picked lifestealer and demanded safelane even though terrorblade was already there. I even tried to convince him to jungle so he can afk farm and not bother the rest of the team, but I was only met with what seemed like a preteen boy yelling at me in an arabic language, with a 140 decibel fan on the background.

My worst fears come true, he selects the courier and his hero, and starts walking towards the mid lane, loudly announcing in all chat that he will provide sustenance to the enemy team. I beg him not to, but it doesn't help, he's closing in on the river. Until, suddenly...

He stops.

His hero and the courier are frozen.

I try to move the courier back to base, and it seems to work, he doesn't try to yank it back to mid. And then those magic words appear on screen.

  

**Lifestealer has disconnected from the game.**  
**Lifestealer has 5 minutes to reconnect.**

  

His hero starts walking back to fountain.

Five minutes pass, the game will not be counted, stats and MMR will not be updated. And while he got an abandon, me and my former teammates agreed to report him for intentional feeding.

As I return to the main menu I am informed that action has been taken against him.

Thank you, GabeN. For looking over me in my darkest hours.~|fluff

Sun Strike delay|self.DotA2|There are 24 hours in a day/night cycle (= 86 400 seconds). In dota, that is 8 minutes (= 480 seconds). Therefore, 1 second in dota equals 180 seconds in real life. It takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds for sunlight to go from the Sun to the Earth. That is 500 seconds in reality, which is 2.77 seconds in dota time. However, sunstrike delay is 1.7 seconds in dota time. For Venus, it would take 2 seconds dota time and for Mercury a bit above 1 second dota time. Therefore, the dota universe is situated somewhere between Mercury and Venus or fix delay.|fluff
