Monkey King!|self.DotA2|~Two new heroes!

*Hnnnnnnng*

I can't even

Volvo has truly outdone itself!

**EDIT:** Alright, I'm drunk af and really hyped up, but I will try to bring clarity to this post for those who are joining us from /r/all.

Valve is currently hosting the 6th edition of the [Dota 2 world championships](http://blog.dota2.com/), The International 6. Pitting 16 of the world's top teams for a world record setting prize pool of over US $20 million dollars. 

Yesterday, during the TI6 All Star Game, [Valve revealed the introduction to Dota 2 of a pre-existing hero which was part of Dota 1, Underlord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7z51Otzpiw).

[Tonight Volvo revealed a brand new hero in the Dota universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guGFT27SavM). Song Dynasty-era Chinese mythological figure Monkey King, AKA Sun Wukong. 

Should you be a fan of esports, TI6 is now, without a doubt, the best [esport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESports) event I have ever had the pleasure to watch. I welcome you to tune in for the final day of the event on Saturday August 13th. 

Check out /r/DotaVods if you are interested in watching some of the matches. Better yet, you can install the Dota 2 client for free(through [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/)), play 100% of the game for free, watch replays of any TI6 match for free, and watch all live TI6 matches for... free. More specifically, try [EG vs EHOME game 1](https://youtu.be/uryTZc4XjNQ), one of the top 5 all time greatest pro Dota matches ever played. 

RIP Harambe

Introducing Dota Plus|blog.dota2.com||news
Official announcement from the teams of Midas Mode|self.DotA2|~We, the participating Midas Mode organizations and players of Evil Geniuses, Immortals, Mid or Feed, Na`Vi, OG, OpTic Gaming, Team Liquid, and VGJ.Storm, have come together this holiday season to take a stand against the tyrannical Grinch going by the name SirActionSlacks. We reject his philosophy of greed, we reject his corrupting mentality of more, and we most definitely reject his lackluster memes! So we are hijacking his tournament for good.

[In all seriousness, we want to thank Slacks and MoonduckTV for being so willing and excited to help us hijack their tournament and its meaning for a bunch of good causes.]

In the spirit of the holidays, the players of all eight teams have pledged to donate all of their prize winnings from Midas Mode to a charity of their teams choice listed below.  We believe that giving back to our communities is a responsibility we all share in life, and we are inspired by other gaming communities who have long been supporting charity and uplifting others. Having the bright lights of Dota upon us, the time is long overdue that we as a Dota community come together to set an example. Gamers can be a positive force in our communities and this is one small step in the right direction.

We ask that all of our fans join with us and support these and many other great causes this holiday season. Please donate a bit of whatever you have to give to help lift someone else up: money, time, canned goods, or a beloved game gathering dust because you spend twelve hours a day grinding for badges now!

Happy holidays,

The Teams

ESL: We were wrong.|self.DotA2|~I`ll get straight to the TL;DR here (and then add more details and context after it):

Over the last few days we were wrong in how we acted in multiple instances, and this post is to apologize to you, fans of esports and community streamers affected. 

We were wrong in how we kicked off streaming on Facebook and we were wrong in handling the follow-up with the community, the communication here and the DMCAs which we have since retracted.

The introduction of Facebook as our new broadcast platform did not go as it should have. Instead of focusing on ironing out the kinks, engaging in the right kind of dialogue with you and incorporating your legitimate feedback we were busy following protocol and defending our actions. We should have simply let the community streamers do their thing while focusing on getting our end right. Regardless of having or not having the right to do so, taking down streamers that provide a good experience while we arent is not the way to go about things.

We were in the wrong. We will learn from it and go forward.

Now, Im not going to try to defend it, but since the platform and streaming of the game is a topic which will resurface, I`ll try and add some details and context which are important to consider for the broader picture:

ESLs goal is to elevate esports. Its been that way for the past 18 years and many of the same people that started the company in 2000 are still the same ones working behind the scenes at ESL today. Were not in it for short-term profits but want to help build an industry. Helping to create esports is not only the core of our efforts, it is all we do. Our mission is to give players and teams a platform to create big moments that you enjoy, talk about and remember. 

Expanding the amount of streaming platforms which show and promote esports and building an environment where platforms compete to show esports is part of that process. Working with companies that can help us bring esports to the mainstream, is part of that process. Yet if the things we do come at the expense of our relationship with the audience, we need to critically re-evaluate our approach. 

We acknowledge our mistakes and we apologize.  What we got wrong last week we want to get right for the rest of the year.  That means learning from what happened, working with Facebook on improving the experience as well as changing the way we talk with you.

All things considered, thank you for watching ESL One Genting, whichever platform you did it on. I'll be here to continue collecting feedback as I have been for the last couple of days and trying to continue the dialogue. ~|news esports

Dota 2 Reborn - The Beta Begins|dota2.com||news
So, The Workshop tools isn't just a modding platform. It's Source 2. And it's running Dota 2.|self.DotA2|~Everything in this package is a new game.  It's all the Dota assets and code ported over to Source 2.  That's why Hammer is different.  That's why the console is different. 

Guys.  Valve just soft launched the entire Source 2 engine.  

EDIT: Because people are asking for proof.

Everything that would share a name with Source is named '...2'.  That's 'engine2.dll', 'vconsole2.exe', 'vphysics2.dll'.

When you go to open a map in Hammer, it asks for .vmap files.  One of the other options is '.vmf (Source 1.0)' files.  [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/HElcsOu.png) (thanks /u/darkmio)

The fucking console is redone.  

There is a new Key-Value like format (~~~~that i'm gonna call KV2~~~~).  It is type safe.  It looks like this: http://pastebin.com/RVQtkv1j.  EDIT: Looks like my name isn't going to stick.  The engine calls them 'Schema Files', written by CSchemaTextWriter. (Voided found this) 

EDIT2 (Probably the strongest evidence): That script also allows for different dlls to load and render different assets (vmaps are rendered by worldrenderer.dll, etc).  This is quite a bit different from Source 1, as they had a large number of things in the engine libraries.  This bit alone would indicate a significant amount of engine work has been done to split these bits out of the engine and into their own libraries.  

^^EDIT: ^^hey ^^RPS ^^i ^^changed ^^this ^^paragraph, ^^so ^^you ^^guys ^^should ^^probably ^^use ^^the ^^updated ^^paragraph ^^as ^^it's ^^more ^^correct.    


EDIT3: ~~~~lol, source2 apparently support fax machines.  (VoiDeD found this) (source: http://privatepaste.com/513891c5dc )~~~~ Looks like the Tiff Library

EDIT4: from /u/nellody: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/w/images/3/35/Tileset_new_outliner.png notice the 'source2' in the path.  

EDIT: the general consensus around the source reverse engineering community is that this is really source 2.  

EDIT: hi neogaf. 

EDIT: 

    3:01:56 AM <@VoiDeD> there's l4d3 crap all over the vscript code

EDIT: 'CSource2EntitySystem' is a class name.  (thanks Netshroud)~|news

##**Drama**

#[](/pennant-eg) Aui_2000 kicked from EG. 
* [Aui_2000 tweets he's been kicked from EG.](https://twitter.com/Aui_2000/status/632366266536214528) - "i have been kicked from eg after winning ti. i actually hate people"
* [Aui_2000 asks for confirmations](https://twitter.com/Aui_2000/status/632370306670170113): - "can someone from eg just fucking confirm so idiots stop tweeting me its fake"

  **1\.** [EE confirms.](https://twitter.com/EternaLEnVy1991/status/632371194264723456) - "I'll confirm it if if means anything :("

  **2\.** [Whatiship confirms.](https://twitter.com/WhatIsHipTV/status/632369771380523008) - "yes AUI is actually kicked from EG. guess teams really do place value on some players rather than others."

  **3\.** [Mikey from FaceIt confirms.](https://twitter.com/Faceit_Mikey/status/632376798001635328) - "Aui out, Arteezy to carry, Fear to support. ~~ EG's team for Majors CONFIRMED.
Lets now stop speculating...Wait for EU shuffle... #dota2"

  **4\.** [Charlie officially confirms.](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sn8s65) - 

        Rather than have people speculate or message players for answers, I'm going to go ahead and announce the new EG Dota 2 roster: Sumail, Universe, Fear, PPD, and Arteezy. 
        
        Yes, Kurtis was removed from the roster. The rest of the players decided that the above roster was what they wanted to go forward with. 
        
        Personally, I'm deeply affected by this and I'm very sad to see Kurtis go. I've known him the longest out of anyone on the team. He was the one that originally asked me to be the manager for Potm Bottom years ago, and I cannot state enough how depressed I am to see him go. I cannot imagine how much worse he feels.
        
        Professionally, I trust the judgment of the captain and the other players. I will not make roster decisions on their behalf and I will not force players to play on rosters they don't want to play on. EG is deeply grateful to Kurtis for what he has helped contribute, and will continue to support him in whatever he decides to do and wherever he decides to go. I say this both for myself and on behalf of the organization.
        
        -Charlie Yang

Stretch Goal #13 Unlocked: Prize Pool is now $6 Million. Well Played!|self.DotA2|~Every goal struck out in just over 10 days. Insane! We can rage at each other as much as we want in-game, but as a community, we are so damn strong and I loved every moment of being a part of it for nearly a decade now.

The big question - are we done yet though? :)

P.s: Buildings hats. Best hats.

**For the non-Dota 2 folk from the Frontpage** | - via /u/suttin

For those of you coming from the front page, Valve hosts a yearly tournament for Dota 2. They sell an in game item called The Compendium, [all you need to know found here](http://www.dota2.com/international/compendium/).

Whats so crazy about this is that 25% of Compendium related purchases go to the prize pool. Valve seeded the prize pool with $1.6 million. The community has raised it another $4.4 million*, to a total of $6 million. 

We have already doubled the biggest ever video game tournament prize pool, set by last years International, and if the prize pool is split the same way as last year, the first place team will take home $3 million, split 5 ways across the team.

- [Prize pool tracker](http://dota2.cyborgmatt.com/prizetracker/international2014) - At the bottom, it compares last years to this years prize pool, Distribution is not confirmed yet.

Dota 2 Beta is now OVER!|store.steampowered.com||news
May 31, 2017 Update|self.DotA2|~###Matchmaking Changes

* As an experimental change for a few days, All Pick will now have **25 heroes randomly removed from the hero pool at the start** of the draft before the ban phase. *This change only affects Ranked Matchmaking*. 

---

###Other Changes

* In today's update we are changing how commands are processed in Dota to address some user input contention and improve responsiveness. Previously if you cast a spell and before it finished casting, you cast two spells afterwards, only the last spell would be cast. The order queue was only 1 deep effectively. This usually has no practical impact, except for things with really fast/instant cast time done in sequence. Here are a few examples of how the behavior would be different:

**Example 1:**

Axe casts battle hunger. While the cast animation is playing, Axe quickly uses a Blink Dagger and then Berserker's Call.

- Old Rules: Only Berserker's Call is cast. The blink dagger order is ignored.
- New Rules: Axe will use the Blink Dagger, then cast Berserker's Call.


**Example 2:**

Puck casts Illusory Orb. Puck then casts Dream Coil. While the cast animation of Dream Coil is playing, Puck quickly casts Ethereal Jaunt and Waning Rift.

- Old Rules: Only Waning Rift would have triggered and Puck would not have teleported with Ethereal Jaunt.
- New Rules: Puck teleports with Ethereal Jaunt and then casts Waning Rift in the new location.


This change applies generally to all orders that are issued when your hero is in another action (like during a cast animation or while stunned), and the order needs to enter the queue. Issuing a movement command or stop will still empty the queue same as before, if you decide you no longer want to issue the orders in the queue.~|news
Dota 7.11|self.DotA2|~7.11:
==

* This version is focused on changing how the gold and buyback formulas work.

* Buyback cost changed from 100 + ( Level * Level * 1.5) + (Time * 0.25) to 100 + Networth / 13
* Buyback no longer reduces gold earned after respawning

* AoE gold for the losing team no longer scales with the overall team networth difference, just the individual networth of the dying hero. Previously, a core on your team doing really well meant that a support on your team dying gave an increasing amount of gold to the enemy. 

- The comeback component is now just: ( DyingHeroNetWorth * 0.026 + 70 ) / # of killers

    This takes the place of the components below that considers Networth 
    For example in the 1 killer case, it replaces (NetWorthEarlyFactor * 90 + NetWorthFactor * 0.03375). 
    Like the previous formula, it is only given to the losing team.

* The gold multiplier based on the dying hero's net worth rank changed from 1.2/1.1/1.0/0.9/0.8 to 1.2/1.05/0.9/0.75/0.6

---

For reference, the previous AoE gold formula is listed below:

**Terms:**

    NetWorthDifference = ( EnemyTeamNetWorth / AlliedTeamNetWorth ) - 1 [With a min of zero and a max of 1]
    
    NetWorthFactor = NetWorthDifference * VictimNetWorth
    
    NetWorthEarlyFactor (for when Enemy has more NW) = ( EnemyTeamNetWorth - AlliedTeamNetWorth ) / 4000 [Has a max of 1]
    
    NetWorthPoorFactor = 1.3 - 0.1 * NetWorthRank (dying's hero's networth rank)
    
    NetWorthRankingFactor (hero's rank amongst allies involved in the kill): For 1/2/3/4/5 from poorest to richest are: { 1 } / { 1.25, 0.75 } / { 1.25, 1.0, 0.75 } / { 1.25, 1.08, 0.916, 0.75 } / { 1.25, 1.125, 1.0, 0.875, 0.75}

**Formula:**

    1 Killer: NetWorthPoorFactor * NetWorthRankingFactor * ( 126 + 4.5 * VictimLevel + NetWorthEarlyFactor * 90 + NetWorthFactor * 0.03375 )
    
    2 Killer: NetWorthPoorFactor * NetWorthRankingFactor * ( 63 + 3.6 * VictimLevel + NetWorthEarlyFactor * 67.5 + NetWorthFactor * 0.03375 )
    
    3 Killer: NetWorthPoorFactor * NetWorthRankingFactor * ( 31.5 + 2.7 * VictimLevel + NetWorthEarlyFactor * 45 + NetWorthFactor * 0.03375 )
    
    4 Killer: NetWorthPoorFactor * NetWorthRankingFactor * ( 22.5 + 1.8 * VictimLevel + NetWorthEarlyFactor * 31.5 + NetWorthFactor * 0.027 )
    
    5 Killer: NetWorthPoorFactor * NetWorthRankingFactor * ( 18 + 0.9 * VictimLevel + NetWorthEarlyFactor * 22.5 + NetWorthFactor * 0.02025 )~|news

All 158 Standard Hero Builds Item, Ability, Talent tooltips have been revised (approx. 3318 changes)|self.DotA2|~*[^2016 ^Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3urlch/all_145_standard_hero_builds_item_and_ability/)*

--
Every year, I review all tooltips to correct inaccuracies or to tighten advice when opting for X item/ability. **After two months of work: I've overhauled all tooltips for all 158 guides** (about 2307 items, 632 abilities, 316 talents: **approx. 176,170 words**).

Lastly, I've pushed some final hero build changes to wrap up 2017: [**in total, 8228 changes were made this year** compared to last year's (2016) 4371 changes](https://twitter.com/TorteDeLini/status/945680817166176256)

--
Key notes: 

* Removed all General Hero Descriptions (too much work to update, served little use and usually outdated)

* Revised, re-written or clarified Ability Descriptions to be more accurate to how the current abilities work

* Most abilities now indicate if it can hit invisible units, dispel debuffs/buffs, has True Strike

* Talents with ambigious names (eg: "Cataclysm") now have a tooltip explaining what they are and how they work

* Any items that were removed from a hero build in the past 5 years have now had their tooltips text wiped to avoid confusing new players

* Reduced # of tooltip descriptions for items to focus more on items that have unique synergy or value

* Cleaned up some verbose text tooltips that ended up repeating the original default text (ability & items)

* Added "combo cheat-sheets" for items that helped with a hero's killing potential (e.g: Morphling's Ethereal Blade to 'shotgun' enemies with magic-damage)

* Added notes to disassemble an item to make other items in the future (e.g: Mask of Madness)

* Specified items like Radiance and Mask of Madness to USE THEM TO HASTEN YOUR FARM, instead of wasting everyone's time by trying to fight with 1 core item...

E-sport is going to be registered as official sport in Poland.|self.DotA2|~It looks like next country decided to do this. Poland can into the Major?

[Source](http://www.dota2tv.pl/threads/e-sport-w-polsce-oficjalnie-uznany-za-sport.1076/)

Translation :

It seems that in our country soon we will speak without hesitation that e-sport is registered as an official sport. All thanks to the amendment to the Act made by the Ministry of Sport and Tourism, which changes the broad importance of sport.


A few months earlier, a similar law adopted Russia, so that it is possible to obtain the official title of "Champion of Russia" or "Honorary Champion of Russia." Even before the decision was made by the Australian government. So all indications are that soon all over the world will be signed similar legislation. Someone could ask but why? 

Well, if the country to which you need to enter a visa, athletes receive it almost immediately. As you know, the scene Dota 2 always struggled with the problem of visas, the best example is the Execration, which therefore had to give up slots at major Boston. Therefore, the more countries recognize e-sport for the sport, the better it is for professional players

Many people, both older and younger think that eSports has no right to be considered as a sport, because it is "simply clicking the mouse." Supporters of the recognition of electronic games as a sport also have a pair of arguments, but the argument on the forums and in comments is not extinguished. Let us hope that this law will change.

Full text of the new law is not yet known, but to expand the concept of "sport" in Article 2 of the Act 1 learned from the Bulletin of the Public Information Office of the Prime Minister. It was announced there include "extending the definition of sport, which from now on would also include mental activity whose aim is to improve the overall efficiency of intellectual property, including cause-and-effect thinking and concentration." Currently, the passage in question of the Act is as follows:

> "Sport is all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organized participation affect or improving physical fitness and mental, social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels."

Reborn Beta Update - September 1, 2015|self.DotA2|~###Coming Soon: The Reborn Update###

With The International behind us and the Majors just around the corner, we are excited to have the world start playing Dota in the brand-new Source 2 engine. Within the coming weeks, the main client will receive the Reborn Update. Moving away from the Source 1 engine soon will allow us to better focus our efforts entirely on Source 2 in preparation for various upcoming tournaments. There are still a few features that will need some work when the update is released, but we plan to finish them quickly. Expect the weeks that follow to focus on ironing out issues, refining the dashboard and iterating based on your feedback. Afterwards, well begin shifting our attention toward the in-game UI, where we plan to redesign the HUD and work on a variety of other in-game features.

Todays update to Reborn contains various bug fixes and improvements, as well as a large number of backend changes that result in a very large one-time download. Now would be a good time for everyone to start downloading the Reborn update, as you will not need to download it again when the main client receives the update in the coming weeks.

If you do not have the Reborn update installed and would like to get a head start on it now, launch the Dota client and head over to the Play Tab to get set up. All of your items are now in the Reborn client, and after today any new content will be added directly to Source 2 only. | [Blog Post](http://blog.dota2.com/2015/09/coming-soon-the-reborn-update/)

**Analysis Status:** Done

###Official Changelog

- Fixed various bugs with matchmaking.
- Adjusted the weight given to behavior metrics to be more focused on a very small percentage of players that were the most offensive players, rather than the general population.
- Adjusted matchmaking for new players to be more sensitive to the number of games played rather than behavior. Players that are detected as smurfs however are treated primarily on their skill and less so on their game count history.
- Improved the behavior scoring system and recalibrated existing behavior score values.

Official Punishment - regarding uG vs Ehug|self.DotA2|~After deliberation we have reached a decision regarding the punishment of Union Gaming for unpausing in game 4 of the Grand Finals, which resulted in first blood being spilled.

Our admins watched the replays from player perspectives, each teams fog of war and of course also took the entire series into consideration as well.  We cannot prove that Union Gaming intentionally unpaused the game to gain advantage, but we can see that it was beneficial for them to do so.  They say it was a misunderstanding, maybe it was, but even as a mistake, this is unacceptable in the situation where it happened.  If a football player accidentally grabs the mask of another player in a game, he will be penalized as if it was intentional, we must penalize Union Gaming for their actions.

We did not have a rule in place at the time and our mod was not sure what to do, so we decided to talk after, with the counsel of more experienced community members and try to reach a fair punishment for the infraction, an infraction which would fall under our "Sportsmanship" clause.  

With all of this said the official punishment for Union Gaming will be a 25% monetary fine and no invitation to Season 3 of DOTA Regions.  This may feel heavy handed to some of you, but to us we cannot tolerate even the suspicion of cheating.  To those of you who think we should have restarted the match immediately, in hindsight this was probably the best option, from here we can only go forward though.  

The money that is being taken away from Union Gaming will not be kept by our organization.  Our entire goal is to stimulate our Semi-Pro scene and foster it's growth.  With this in mind, we will be donating the 25% fines to Amateur Dota 2 League and NEL, two leagues that we have alot of respect for and wish to see continued success in.  Rest assured that DOTA Regions cares deeply about this community, that we will not tolerate abuses and that we will continue to learn and grow.  Our rule set will be much more thoroughly worked out next season.  Sorry to eHug for the problems.  Hope to see you guys in Season 3, until then GLHF!~|news esports

- Added a damage sound to Blademail reflect (only audible to attacking player)
- Added a sound on Diffusal Blade target units
- Corrected Clockwerk's spawn line
- Fixed FoW issues with some Invoker, Crystal Maiden, and Nature's Prophet abilities
- Visage ult sound no longer stacks with number of familiars

**Visuals**

- New support for remnant based effects. Visual updates to Storm/Ember/Earth Spirit remnants can be applied to all wearable items and will properly mimic when Rubick steals them
- Modified Storm Spirit's effects to bring them visually in line with other Spirits

**Coaching**

- Anyone in a matchmaking party can specify that they'd like to coach the party instead of play. In lobbies, players can choose to coach a team instead of play or spectate. Coaches cannot be used in Team Matchmaking, or Tournament lobbies.
- Increased maximum matchmaking party size to 6, to allow a coach to teach an entire team of students (but you can't Find Match if you have 6 players with no coach)
- Coaches are able to use in-player perspective views and broadcaster tools like line drawing to teach their students. They are able to ping on the ground, the minimap, and anywhere in the HUD itself.
- Coaches are considered to be on the same team as their students, so they cannot see anything in the game that their students can't see.
- Coaches and students have private voice and text communication channels.
- Coaches can hit their 'Hero Select' key to cycle through their students.
- Coaches see spectator-style item purchase popups for their students.
- In-perspective player view now shows the correct state of more HUD elements (Shop Quickbuy, KDA/Last Hits/Denies, Buyback). These improvements apply the the in-perspective view in live games and replays, as well as coaches.

**ECONOMY**

**Steam Community Market**

- This update may greatly disrupt market prices. In order to prevent items being purchased at pre-update prices for arbitrage, we are removing all item listings and returning them to their owners. While this removal process is taking place, new items will not be able to be listed on the Steam Community Market.
- You can now list an item on the market from the armory (right click: sell on the market).
- Armory item tooltips now contain the current lowest trading price for an item of the same class as the one highlighted. (Class is a somewhat flexible concept at the moment, so unusual courier prices will be less accurate than a specific wearable piece of equipment.)

**Crafting**

- Crafting recipes now have a chance of dropping as a bonus item. These drops do not take up your normal drops, but are in addition to them.

- **Polymorph Recipes**
- These recipes take a variable number of any input of the same rarity and output a random other item of the same rarity. Example: 2 of Any Rare => 1 Random Different Rare
- **Augment Recipes**
-These recipes take a combination of inputs of the same rarity and output a random other item of the next best rarity. Example: 1 of Any Common & 1 Wavecrester => 1 Random Uncommon
- **Ancient Scroll Case**
- A new type of Treasure Chest called the "Ancient Scroll Case" has been added. These cases drop multiple recipes when they are opened.
- The Ancient Scroll Case has a chance to drop an Exceptional Recipe. These make items that were previously only available as Genuine quality promotional items. The recipe creates a non-genuine version of the item.

**Gems & Sockets**

- Items can now have up to 5 sockets.
- A socket can receive a gem. Each socket can only contain one gem.
- Some sockets require specific types of gems.
- When a gem is added to a socket that already contains a gem, the previous gem is destroyed.
-  **New Socketing Tools:**
- Artificer's Chisel: Adds a socket to an item.
- Artificer's Hammer: Extracts the gems from an item.
-  **Gem Types:**
- *Kinetic Gems*
- Adds a new animation to the hero using the item.
- *Inscribed Gems*
- Adds stat tracking ability to the item similar to the old strange system.
- The item they are added to changes to the "Inscribed" quality.
- *Ethereal Gems*
- Adds a particle effect to the item.
- All unusual effects can now be colorized.
- *Prismatic Gems*
- Colorizes the particle effect on the effect gem.
- *Ascendant Gems*
- The Ascendant Orb, Gem of Taegeuk, and Bloodstones are now Ascendant Gems.
- The item they are added to changes to the "Ascendant" quality. (in addition to tracking victories or gifts given as they did before).
- **Autograph Runes**
- Autographs are now Autograph Runes.
- Allows you to tag an item with a pro player's autograph.
- Since an item can have 5 sockets, you can now get a whole team to autograph an item.
- The item they are added to changes to the "Autographed" quality.
- **Spectator Gems**
- Items that previously tracked 'games viewed' now contain spectator gems.
- Spectator gems follow a specific league or team.
- Styles that previously required 'games viewed' now require a gem with the same number of games viewed (for the correct league / player / team / etc).
- Ethereal & Prismatic gems are used together on unusual items (couriers).
- More types of gems will be coming in the future.
- Unusual items do not change quality when gems are added. Non-unusual items will change in the order gems are added.

**Item Quality Keywords**

- The item quality keyword "Vintage" has been changed to "Elder".
- The item quality keyword "Tournament" has been changed to "Heroic".
- The item quality keyword "Haunted" has been changed to "Cursed".
- The item quality keyword "Strange" has been changed to "Inscribed".

**Strange Items**

- Strange modifiers on items have been converted into stat tracking Inscribed Gems.
- The stats on items are no longer wiped when an item is traded.
- Strange modifiers that haven't been applied have been turned into 'gem packs' that grant a living stat tracking gem and a Artificer's Chisel to create a socket on an item.
- Previously strange quality items are now have the inscribed quality.

**Unusual Paint & Colors**

- Unusual paint items have been changed into Gem Packs that will grant a gem of the same color of the old paint item when used.
- All couriers that were painted in the past will now have color gems already installed of the appropriate color.
- All legacy courier colors (very old drop colors, bugged colors, etc) have been preserved as color gems. If you want, you can smash the courier to recover the legacy color gem and use it on some other courier or effect combination.
- All unusual paint items on the Steam Community Market have been delisted. You can relist the Color Gem Packs.
- All non-legacy colors (colors that drop normally from Treasure Chests) now have specific names (i.e.: "Verdant Green"). Legacy colors will have the name "Legacy (R G B)". (Most Legacy Colors are completely unique, but there are a few where more than one of that color exist.)
- New colors will appear on Treasure Chest unusuals from time to time moving forward. - While we will avoid selecting legacy colors we cannot completely guarantee that new colors will not sometimes be similar. The 800 or so unique legacy colors in existence cover a large amount of color space.
