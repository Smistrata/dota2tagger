Update from the Shanghai Major|self.DotA2|~Two things:

1) James.  We've had issues with James at previous events.  Some Valve people lobbied to bring him back for Shanghai, feeling that he deserved another chance.  That was a mistake.  James is an ass, and we won't be working with him again.

2) As long as we're firing people, we are also firing the production company that we've been working with on the Shanghai Major.  They will be replaced, and we hope to get this turned around before the main event.

As always, I can be reached at gaben@valvesoftware.com.

Day[9] Learns Dota with Purge - Jan 18th & every Wednesday for 4 months|self.DotA2|~Hey /r/Dota2!  A few months ago I picked up Dota 2 and have been having a blast playing.  As you might imagine, I quickly started to devour Purges videos and began bombarding him with various questions.  Since I was clearly hungry to learn more we figured, why not make a video series about it?

Day[9] Learns Dota will be a long term video series where Purge will coach me (I'm currently at ~~250h of dota) for a few months, teaching core, structural components to proper play.  Our goal is not focus on specific heroes and builds (since a patch could change them at any moment).  Instead, we hope to focus on deeper core concepts that can be useful in any version of Dota.  Weve been planning this show for a few weeks now, so the timing of Dota 7.00 couldnt have been better.  Theres quite a bit to learn now :D.

**Format**

Every Wednesday show will be 5-6 hours long.

* 30-60m - Intro Lesson - Purge will prepare a lesson for a given topic
* 3h-4h - Day[9] plays games - Ill be battling with Purges divine teachings in mind
* 60m - Post session review & coaching - Purge will give an end-cap session to highlight mistakes Im making and reinforce the intro lesson

**Topics**

* Basic calculation and farming efficiency
* Introductions to each role - Safelane, Mid, Offlane, Roamer/ganker, support etc
* Teamfight decision making
* Basic team wide strategy
* Understanding build orders
* How to decide where & when to rotate
* And more!

**How to watch**

The show starts on January 18th and will continue every Wednesday for approximately 4 months.

* Live streams will run from 1pm PST to 7pm PST
* Content will be uploaded to our respective pages
  * PurgeGamers  [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/purgegamers) / [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/PurgeGamers)  
  * Day[9]TV [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/day9tv) / [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/day9tv) 


**Other assorted notes**

* Please do not try to give me Dota 2 advice during the next few months.  Advice and help is great, but when youre an internet personality, there are a few thousand people a day trying to contact you.  I still have no good way to manage that volume of conversation so please be understanding if you hear no response from me :).
* Im currently 2.2k solo MMR
* My favorite characters are Natures Prophet, Zeus, Lion, Lina, and Nyxnyxnyxnyxnyx.
* I hate Slark.~|announce
My stream was hacked|self.DotA2|~Hey, so I'm reaching out to everyone who donated to me in the last 48 hours, please cancel all the donations if possible, he hacked my account and exchanged my paypal with his own, meaning all the money that was sent went to his account. I sincerely apologise for all the trouble that has been caused through this. I've secured my account with the help of the twitch staff and it should be very secure now. I spoke to them and other than cancelling the transactions there is nothing else that can be done, again im terribly sorry this happened. I'll also try to PM everyone who donated money to me on twitch itself....please bump this up as fast as possible so everybody has a chance to cancel. To clarify the situation, I personally didn't lose any money, but I feel like an asshole because all of your money that was sent the last 2-3 days went to this guy's account.

Sincerely, Black~|announce

Regarding Gifting|self.DotA2|~We hate the gift restrictions as much as you do. We thought it'd be helpful to explain to you why they exist so that you can have a better view into the challenges surrounding fraud. Throughout this post we'll talk about gifting compendiums to friends, but this applies in general to all items purchased from the store.

Here's the problem: Bad guys buy compendiums with stolen credit cards, and then resell them to other players at a discount. It can take days to determine that the cards were stolen, and that a fraudulent item had been added to the economy. We can't effectively punish the fraudsters, because they're not really traceable - they commit the fraud on new or stolen accounts, never on their own accounts. In addition, these side markets make it very easy for people to get scammed.

When this started happening in 2013, we decided that the impact fraud was having on players and the economy wasn't big enough compared to the drawbacks of imposing restrictions on everyone. Unfortunately, like all scams that make money, it ballooned rapidly. The moment a method of fraud becomes profitable, it will explode in scope until we can find a way to address it. In 2014, the percentage of compendium purchases that turned out to be fraudulent became very significant and we also saw a massive growth in scam-related support requests from users that didn't receive their items or had their accounts stolen. Additionally, credit card fraud can become a big problem for us because if our fraud rates climb too high, we will no longer be allowed to accept credit card payments at all.

So, we added the time-based trade restriction to allow time to detect and limit the impact that the fraudulent activity has. We believe it actually hurts sales when we put restrictions on our players, because it means it's harder to buy a gift for your friend, for example. We hated doing it, but we didn't have a better solution. We are continuously exploring different methods to solve these problems, because we want to be able to stop fraud without affecting legitimate users.~|announce

/r/DotA2, HELP US! Since the compendium patch, I got more abandons than I've had in the last 4 years. Not only me - but my entire state.|self.DotA2|~http://imgur.com/lBpO85u - My terrible conduct summary from the last week.
-
**This is going to be a long post poorly written by a Brazilian. BUT PLEASE, help me raising awareness to the critical server issue that is going on in Rio de Janeiro since the last big patch.**
-
Ive tried dev.dota2 and even /r/DotA2 earlier this week  but we are getting almost no attention. Rio de Janeiro really needs to get this to the front page.
-
Since the last big patch, when the compendium was released, **100%** of the players from RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL who use the NETVIRTUA ISP are having **UNPREDICTABLE** kicks due to timeout. After the kicks, we are not able to reconnect no matter how hard we try. It's a locked door to our own room, and our cute puppy swallowed the key.
Since it happens mostly for NETVIRTUA RJ users, and it started happening right after the patch, I strongly believe the problem is on the route between our ISP and Valve servers. **Contacting our ISP DID NOT solve anything.** *I am pretty sure that Valve can work it out for us.*
-
**But /u/RenanWtf, why should I care? I am not Brazilian, and I don't like you guys.** *Well, that is fair. But...*
-
* 1) This could be happening to any of us. Whether you want it or not, we're all the same community. At the end of the day we all have the same objective: ~~~~shitposting~~~~ playing some Dota with our friends.

* 2) And most importantly - If the problem is exclusive for Brazilian servers, even considering the high latency, US East servers will soon be our new home. I believe you dont want that HUEHUEHUEHUE.

-
**Well, CARIOCAS from Rio de Janeiro, couldn't you just stop playing and wait for your problem to get fixed?** *That would be a good suggestion, but the thing is: our problem WILL NOT GET FIXED unless we seek for help. And we've been trying to do that A LOT.*
-
* We also cannot just check if everything is okay before finding a match to decide whether or not we should play, because the ping is always perfect. The problem always comes up after a few minutes into the game, like 10 minutes onwards.

-
Enough talking. I think you all get the point. We have a problem, we cannot play without getting heavily punished (24 hour bans, low priority queues, reports all game).
-
TL;DR - Valve should know what is happening in Rio de Janeiro, and how a big chunk of players is completely unable to play due to server issues.
-
-
*Help us! Put our differences aside. I've put a lot of effort in this essay. ^Up^vote this for visibility. Come on, do it. You've upvoted shittier threads. Go ahead. I am waiting. My favelas and vuvuzelas are all getting ready to annoy the shit out of you unless you upvote Rio de Janeiro. Cariocas and the Christ Redeemer cannot wait to bring our samba and carnaval to the US East servers.*

**[EDIT: May 24th]: UPDATE**
As /u/MoNeYINPHX suggested, I've tried tracerouting the brazilian servers as well as the US East server.
Here are my results, can someone help me understand what is going on?

*Can someone help me understand this?*~|announce
7.01 Update|store.steampowered.com||announce
Miracle, Moon, Cr1t Leaves OG|facebook.com||announce esports
gg friends|self.DotA2|~Ive never tried to be too much of a public figure, so when it comes to my departure from the subreddit Id probably most prefer to go silently with zero fanfare. However, Ive been told by a few too many people that Ive got to say *something* after moderating this place for over five years, so here *it* is:

**After today I'll no longer be part of the mod team here at r/Dota2. The reason is pretty simple, I'm moving on to other opportunities related to the game and it wouldnt be kosher for me to retain any sort of position here. Im not quite ready to reveal those at this point (feel free to wildly speculate), but know that you'll probably see me around the community for some time still.**

I've been a redditor for coming up to eight years now, visiting the site almost every single day without fail, and for the most part Ive been an absolutely proud participant in the community here. However much shit gets thrown at this site, ever since I first uncovered it, it has had an immeasurable positive influence upon my life, with the biggest part of that being this subreddit. While I've moderated other reasonably large subreddits, nothing compares to /r/Dota2. Getting to watch this place grow from zero subscribers to the unruly monster it is today has mostly been an absolutely great experience.

Ive always tried (and sometimes even succeeded) to guide the subreddit's moderation from a place of general rationality, and I wouldnt leave if I didn't feel like there wasn't the right people in place to continue that. So Ill make it official now and relinquish my "head moderator" status. The person that will take over this frankly unglamourous title from myself is /u/0Hellspawn0 whose recruitment is probably my greatest legacy on the betterment of this subreddit.

Much of what is good about the community stems from Hellspawn. Hes an absolutely rational and lovely person that gives a lot to this place (with only the black marks of adding both /u/Leafeator AND /u/GoblinTechies (RIP) to the mod team). Ive been mostly absent from the day-to-day moderation of the subreddit for some time now, so I doubt youll see anything in the way of immediate change, but hopefully unbridled from my stodgy management of this place he and the other mods will be able to make more improvements with the moderation around here.

Speaking of which, Id also like to publicly welcome /u/coronaria, the first fresh face in the mod team for some time, who has already been doing an excellent job of brightening up this place. Please give her a warm welcome!

Although I certainly could, Im not going to launch into a long list of acknowledgments here but just make two simple and heartfelt thank yous:

Firstly to all the other mods, helpers and contributors on r/Dota2 that really do give a lot of themselves to making this place better. Its pretty amazing the amount of man hours that these guys have given to this largely thankless, unrewarding job. Im always blown away by how you guys can remain so dedicated day after day, year after year. Im truly grateful that Ive been able to consider you as not only as colleagues but also as great friends.

And secondly, I'll just thank the entirety of reddit for having such a profound impact on my life. People love to constantly shit on (myself included) this site and community, and while it's often an endless source of frustration, it can also absolutely reflect the best of humanity. Ive been able to make so many amazing, lifelong friends, both directly and indirectly of this site and its totally changed the way I view and interact with the world.

Anyways, if you were always a big reaverxai fan (heh), feel free to toss me a shout or follow on twitter [@reaverxai](https://twitter.com/reaverxai). Thats it, Im out - maybe now Ill finally be able to play pubs without a fake name and not be subject to the merciless verbal assaults of clever redditors and memefiends.

Edit: Thanks for all the nice words, really do appreciate them all. Sorry to anyone offended that I made a goodbye post, feel free to downvote/hide it!~|announce

All 145 Standard Hero Builds Item and Ability texts have been completely written|self.DotA2|~A year ago, [I read a post about how the tooltips](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2pq0as/updated_for_683_and_just_hit_50_million/cmz1h92) for the ["Standard Hero Builds Project"](http://steamcommunity.com/id/0825771/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides&p=5&numperpage=30) were not as useful as they could be.

Despite the appreciation I've been receiving about this project, I always felt guilty about how nonoptimal the tooltips were, because I have not been able to update them due to a bug listed here: http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=175090 (and also just lack of available time).

I know a lot of people are suffering from this bug to update their builds; thankfully a user named /u/parnakra has a temporary fix for it here: [/r/dota2 topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3lxz05/shoutout_to_uparnakra_who_made_a_fix_for_the_hero/)

**After two months of work: I've managed to overhaul all tooltips for all 145 guides** (about 4,205 items and 580 abilities plus general hero summary: approx. 235,000 words in tooltips written).

--
* In almost every hero guide, there is an ability cheat-sheet to help users understand how to "combo" with their hero. To add, there are now lists of scenarios that an ability/item could be useful for a hero goals: [example - see here](http://imgur.com/Ra0Xcmv), [example 2 - see here](http://imgur.com/eW2al80)

* As of yesterday, the project has accumulated **[over 108 million subscriptions across 145 guides](http://www.liquiddota.com/forum/the-tavern/453377-in-game-standard-hero-builds-100-million-subscriptions?page=242#4835)**

PSA: Crumbling Island Arena is no more|self.DotA2|~The new patch completely broke it. Again. And by the looks of it the problem is fully on valve's side. Again. I removed the game from workshop. Everyone can refund their CG passes.

I'm on a month long business trip so I won't be able to even look at a possible way to fix it for 2 weeks. And I doubt I can even fix it. The game just freezes completely.

Public apology to the DOTA 2 community|self.DotA2|~Hello everyone,

As producer and showrunner, I want to apologize on behalf of PGL for airing the clip that closed the broadcast of the Kiev Major.
 
A lot of people were disappointed and the high expectations set for us were not met. We let you down, and the clip does not reflect PGL's values, team diversity or broadcast philosophy.
 
We have the utmost respect for the Dota 2 community and, going forward, the video production workflow will be improved with additional checks and quality filters to ensure that mistakes like this will not happen again.
 
Everything we do is for the community and your feedback is and always will be very important to us.
 
Thank you for helping us do better next time.~|announce esports

**/u/JoBoDo_252 and I are happy to announce that [ReIncarnation RPG](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=299009781&tscn=1503356722) is now released on the Dota2 Arcade!**

# About ReIncarnation

ReIncarnation is a Dota2 Custom Game that /u/JoBoDo_252 and myself been developing for over 18 months with great passion and dedication. We've had about 300 testers pass through the game and we've received nothing but good feedback (and bug reports along the way, of course!)
It's one of the biggest and most fully fledged RPG's to hit the Dota2 Arcade to date.

[GoDz and others from Beyond the Summit are playing the game right now!](https://www.twitch.tv/beyondthesummit)

***

# Game Overview
We drew inspiration from classic WC3 RPG's such as the iconic Twilight's Eve, aiming to bring a fresh perspective to the games of our youth. Indeed in ReIncarnation there are over 43 completely custom heroes separated across four Tiers that you are able to advance through as you play the game, ending in a choice of 24 heroes at the max tier.
The early/mid game is designed to be somewhat solo-able, and not too punishing without a party. As you enter late and end-game, a party is going to become more and more valuable, but for those who wish to play solo it will be difficult but not impossible to progress.

# The Path Forward
/u/JoBoDo_252 and I have no intention of stopping development with the release. We plan to continue balancing and polishing the game far into the future. We have plans for expansion maps including a PVP-oriented battleground where you can fight in objective-based arenas using your hard-earned characters, and more PVE/story-based maps where you can explore more of the world of ReIncarnation and it's secrets!

[ReIncarnation RPG - A Dota2 Custom Game](http://imgur.com/bW5OVrA) - Coming August 22nd!

[Join us on discord!](https://discord.gg/CQRKrDX)

ReIncarnation has been in development for over 18 months. We've had about 250 testers pass through the game and we've received nothing but good feedback (and bug reports along the way, of course!)

## Game Overview


The game is inspired by classic WC3 RPG's such as the iconic Twilights Eve and many have called it a pseudo-successor to this game. Indeed in ReIncarnation there is over 43 custom heroes separated across four Tiers that you are able to advance through as you play the game. There are currently 24 heroes at the max tier.

We've designed early-mid game to be soloable, and not too punishing without a party. As you enter late and end-game, a party is going to become more and more valuable, but it's still not a requirement. Players who wish to solo late game are just going to have to work hard to get the best equipment to do so.

Oracle MMR calibration exploit (abuse)|self.DotA2|~Every 2nd game there's a guy who picks Oracle and spams Purifying Flames on his teammates. And that's that. He'll never use any other of his skills to help.  
  
  
Please look closely at these 2 Dotabuff accounts:  
[1st](http://www.dotabuff.com/players/314806723/matches?date=&hero=oracle)  
[2nd](http://www.dotabuff.com/players/244450404/matches?date=&hero=oracle)  
Do you see a connection here? These guys are LOSING their games but rank UP in bracket. Why?  
The answer is simple. Since all of these are calibration games, win/loss or KDA ratio doesn't matter as much. This is why all they care about is amount of Hero Healing, which is fluctuates from 30000 to 40000 per game.  
  
  
You may ask - Why oracle is the problem? Can't they pick Omni or Dazzle and do the same?  
Answer is simple. It's never going to be as effective as healing with Oracle, since Purifying Flames is doing damage before applying heal. A very strong stackable heal. So you can "heal" at any time, anywhere.  
  
  
That's basically it. These guys are reaching 4k incredibly fast (1-2 games) and lose us games, since losing 400+ hp before every fight doesn't really help.  
  
  
This subreddit was super effective last times we asked help from Valve, so I hope they'll react quickly when this gets enough exposure.

Ti5 qualifiers coverage hub of Unimpressiveness-THE SCRUB HUB|self.DotA2|~Hello, I am here to officially announce the SCRUB HUB (formally named the FU Hub) located in beautiful Colorado, USA. Scrub Hub exists as a alternative to the soon to be wildly popular and much more viewed Hub for viewing the Ti5 qualifiers. Rather than the support of Three Studios and and the unlimited funds/manpower of Twitch Tv, we are putting on a hub with beer and no money, bringing the best of all Dota 2 talent that is not attending the good hub. 
	
**Info**
The SCRUB HUB will consist of SirActionSlacks sealing himself in a room with cameras and trying to cast games for as long as he can stay awake. *ANYONE IS INVITED TO ATTEND* be that via co casting, taking over casting with a solo cast, or even showing up to my house irl. (to cast simply add SCRUBHUB on skype and you will be selected to cast when your turn comes, and to actually come to my house please DM me for my information).  Of course I will need to sleep eventually, and when that time comes I will put my stream into the trusting hands of someone who says they wanna host the stream while I sleep. We will do all the games. ALL OF THEM. 

**Additional Perks**

Not only will the SCRUB HUB feature everyone who wants to show up, but it will also feature the following unique things


	Pug Cam with Go Pro on Pug 

	Lounge Cam of my empty living room.

	A sealed room where I will slowly lose my mind alone, with the window taped shut and all clocks disabled. 

	People that show up will sleep on my floor or couch. 

	Literal blackjack and perhaps Hookers

	Most likely the end of my 4 year relationship with my girlfriend. 

	A 70% chance of horrific failure, like a horrendous car crash. Be there for one mans humiliating defeat. 


**Is This Real?**

Yes, this is 100% real. Those games are sitting on DotaTV ripe for the casting and we gonna cast that shit as long as I (and you) can.

***will there be things beside casting?***

Yes, like the real hub I will give the casting to others while I go do other shit in my house/play other games with you the viewers or anyone that shows up to my house. 

***really? This is real?***

Shit yeah, I even got a few hommies that arnt going to the real hub to stop by. Seriously, you right now reading this can be a part of the Scrub Hub. Lets do it.

**this is a terrible idea, you know that right**

Yes.

Thank you. 

Tl:Dr: (in a style you are familiar with) 

I am ashamed to announce that SirActionSlacks & his friends will be teaming up to form a coverage hub of very poor quality dedicated to the upcoming TI5 qualifiers. The qualifiers are set to take place between May 25th - June 1st and so will our very low budget and low quality stream.
 
You are an idiot, what does this actually mean?
With the support of No One and in partnership with Fuck ALL and their studios located in EatADick Ave., we were able to bring under the same roof one Dota 2 personality ranging from Slacks. By the way, when we say one, we actually mean whoever wants to show up 0 people to be exact! One casting stream will be complemented by a Pug Cam, following a hectic schedule with games running 24/7 during 8 straight days (yes, literally). Here is the full talent list:

Announcing Pudge Wars|d2pudgewars.com||announce
Clarification: Meat Hook does NOT get wider towards the end, and here is proof.|self.DotA2|~So there has been a post about the Meat Hook on the LD in that pro match today, because it looked very suspicious. And people in the comments said that the hook would get wider towards the end.

Now, the first comment I read it from, I thought they are just joking because the hook stuff is basically a meme by now and people just make up random silly stuff to explain it. But there were more posts saying the same and they were actually being serious. Turns out someone managed to spread this without having accurate proof.

So [this] (https://gfycat.com/PointlessThoseAnnashummingbird) is the gif he used as proof. There are several issues with it.

* We don't know how the pudge and the 2 targets were aligned
* We can clearly see that the hook was launched by just estimating.

So what we have in the gif is pudge launching a hook which looks horizontal towards units which seem aligned. But neither is the hook 100% horizontal, nor are the targets 100% aligned with Pudge.

----
----

So I went and took these videos.

The first video doesn't need any explaining, it's all done in the video. It is long though (9 minutes).

But since people hate watching long videos, I also made a shorter version. What I did in the shorter one is:

* Put pudge at a certain spot, and a plague ward 500 range away from him (both perfectly aligned)
* Put 5 Svens on each side of Pudge, 124.001 range away from the hook's travel path, so the hook doesnt hit
* Then moved Pudge and the ward 0.001 range down, it starts to hit the svens on the bottom row.
* Then moved Pudge and the ward back to the original spots
* Then moved the top furthest sven 0.001 range down, the hook did hit it (the typical "bullshit" hook)

* [Long, explaining video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPhBOIn1ylo)
* [Short video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMekZg-vgdM)~|announce

Due to the lack of a Official Panel for the Major, Presenting for ONE NIGHT ONLY the EMERGENCY POWER PANEL|self.DotA2|~#Hello there folks!


Due to the majors not having a official panel and all of the best talent being at the majors, we have decided to enact the **EMERGENCY POWER PANEL** to guide you through all the games for the major since literally no one else can do it. 

That's right, we, **the forsaken of Shanghai** will lead you through the games with as much production quality one German man can handle.

Of course, out of respect for the event, we will only have the stream up in-between games, and will host the main stream as soon as the main stream goes back online. 

Join us here at moonduck with special friends for one night only.

# THE PANEL NEVER DIES: Live on [twitch.tv/moonducktv](http://www.twitch.tv/moonducktv)

Note: we'll go live when the game is over. No ads, no bullshit, no drama, only Dota.

edit: Live now until game 2 between LGD and Newbee is going

FPL. Inhouse league for pros!|self.DotA2|~Hello guys! Loda here

Few weeks ago I was approached by some players that wanted to discuss the possibility of creating a new Inhouse League where we could just get good games and practice that would actually mirror pro games. Somehow I was elected as one of the people to make this happen, and with the help of Funn1k the true backbone of the project :D we finally managed to achieve that ambitious goal thanks also to the support of awesome people over at Faceit which provided us a client and the biggest prizepool in the history of Inhouse Leagues! :) And it will grow! 

Today, 13th April, the Season 1 of The FACEIT Pro League starts and it will last till 13th May and players will have the chance to compete for a total of 10,000 Euro of Prize Money.

 


The initial playerpool of the league is made by players coming from Europe/CIS since the league will be played on EU servers and we agreed to vouch only those players able to guarantee a certain competitive level which for us remains the unique and essential element to keep an Inhouse Legue project successful and entertaining for both players and community. Therefore, beyond players coming from the most important European professional teams, also other teamless guys whowe think are more than enough skilled for the FPL will appear in the starting list.
 



Besides the initial playerpools and in order to keep the influx of young, fresh players going, other players can qualify in the lague trough the Faceit ladder system, where every month the top 3 players of the ''Master League'' will qualify for the top one. We hope with this system to give new young talents an easier way to take more visibility for the professional scene, just how it was very long time ago.




DotaTV tickets and weekly shows from The GD Studio

 



With FACEIT, we decided to have free tickets with DotaTV completely FREE for anyone to watch and give everyone the chance to watch professional players in a more relaxed environment


 

We are happy also to announce that The GD Studio together with other Dota2 personalities agrees to sit down every week and making cool shows for you guys and casting some FPL matches!

Check it out if you are interested! :)

Thanks valve for finally banning cheaters out of dota!|self.DotA2|~Finally valve got around they Anti-VAC 
and here is a banwave: https://steamdb.info/stats/bans/


How do you know that these are dota 2 vac bans? -> Well if you look at 'cheater' website forum you will see that everyone is crying that they got VAC banned, and same of them even lost 1000$ dota 2 items, had 1000 lvl compendium.

Did they got banned for scripts like auto disable and so on? --> These are NOT scripts, these are real hacks what are begin injected into game. One of the popular hacks has over 100+ features like auto techies mine detonate, auto disable and so on.


Anyways thanks to Valve, maybe finally I will get out of 1k. kappa

PSA: MMR is SKILL RATING system and not a REWARD/PUNISHMENT system.|self.DotA2|~I just came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/68y8w7/bsj_just_had_a_game_where_his_team_won_a_team/) now and many posts have come up before with comments suggesting "PUNISHMENT" for intentional feeding based on MMR.

For fuck sake, try to understand that MMR is supposed to be and is a measure of SKILL and not a REWARD based system. If a 7k MMR player is "PUNISHED" by making him be only 2k MMR, it doesn't even matter to the guy in the long run. His ingame MMR might have been slashed off. But for god sake, he is still a 7k MMR player  by skill and he had got there. That is where he belongs. It will just be a matter of time until he climbs back to his actual MMR by stomping scrubs on the way ruining games for that skill bracket.

This is why a 2k account buyer eventually drops to 2k, whatever MMR account he may buy, and why a 7k player eventually ends up at 7k even if he starts at 1 MMR.

#MMR IS NOT AN INCENTIVE.

IT IS A RATING OF HOW RELATIVELY GOOD YOU ARE AT THE GAME WITH RESPECT TO OTHER PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME.

#STOP SUGGESTING MMR AS REWARD OR PUNISHMENT

P.S: Sorry if it seemed to be a rant. It just felt out of place that too many people think MMR as a REWARD SYSTEM.~|announce
Pyrion Flax Gameathon 2014 for Cancer Research|self.DotA2|~IMPORTANT INFO HERE: http://imgur.com/KvOf4Co  

twitch stream here www.twitch.tv/pyrionflax  
It will go live a few times before the event when I just stream for fun, but the ACTUAL EVENT starts August 16th.   
  
Howdy y'all. I'm going to be doing a charity stream on Saturday, starting at 10am GMT. Plan is to run all day, hopefully without technical hitches, and just play Dota and other games and get viewers to donate money to Cancer Research via Justgiving.com.  
  
I called Cancer Research myself, suggested the idea, they loved it and said Justgiving was the best way to do this. I don't have any idea how much we might be able to raise, so I'm going to start off with a humble amount of 2,000 (about $3,300 or so) and hope we can make that goal or more.    
  
I'll be streaming from 10am until as late as my ancient, decaying body can handle. It might even happen that we get someone to take over the stream for a few hours while I get some sleep and then I can get back in the next morning, who knows?  
  
I'll be running ads and things during the broadcast and all the ad money will also go to Cancer Research. So, if you're tuning in and don't feel like donating it would be great if you could at least turn off whatever blocking software you use as a small way to support this great charity.  
  
I hope you can tune in, and any dota people or games industry people out there that feel like dropping by and playing some games, go ahead and do so! Tweet at me, I can give you our TS details, and you can climb aboard the love bus.   
  
************* EDIT EDIT EDIT *****************

OK Great response so far! I've had a ton of suggestions and offers. I also have to ask you guys for some ideas.

If we did giveaways or "prizes" if you like for donations, how could we make sure that the right people get the prizes? I'm thinking of a way people can make donations on Justgiving using their steam name but someone could easily change their name to that name and try to claim the prize. So what kind of system could we use to prevent that happening? How has this been done in the past? This is my fault for not figuring this out earlier, but hey we've got a couple of days to get this right!


Wish us luck.  
  
Love,

/r/tz|self.DotA2|~Hey Now, 

Today is a wondrous day in the reddit dota community. Not only are we seeing the start of DAC Main Stage, but we are rolling out some much anticipated and highly requested subreddit features. Think of it like /r/dota2 7.00.

_____

You likely noticed our first change before you opened this thread. Over the past four years /r/dota2 has celebrated and championed Artour Arteezy Babaev. From his humble competitive beginnings with team Kaipi in 2013, he has always been a reddit darling. The man is a walking meme factory, and with such fanfare comes oodles and oodles of reddit posts.   

The excess of Arteezy posts caused a bit of a stir among /r/dota2 users. While some championed the endless drama, stream highlights, fan art, and shitposts, others became outraged that this Arteezy-centric content was overrunning the sub.

[Unfortunately for the latter group, we have the data to show that they were a vocal minority.](http://i.imgur.com/nLuYzd2.png) 

As a result of this data we are going full steam ahead with giving the people what they want, more Arteezy content. 


/r/dota2 is now /r/tz 
With this change we will be enforcing the new Arteezy Rule: 

Every post must be related to Arteezy 
Post can be tangentially related to Arteezy if you can provide proof of the relation. 
For Example: DAC Content is applicable because Arteezy is a player at the event. 

Going forward, any post that does not show relation to Arteezy will be removed. 


###But wait, theres more!  

We would also like to introduce the /r/tz talent tree. We have been working very hard on a system that allows you the users to help guide the direction of the subreddit. As /r/tz gains EXP over the course of the day, you will be able to vote on which talent to implement into the subreddit.

Talent A| LEVEL| Talent B
:--|:--:|--:
MMR Verification System| **25** | [Serious] Posts Only
+7 Day Ban Duration | **20** | -7 Day Ban Duration
+4 Moderators | **15** | +17% Post Removal Rate
BabyRage Global Emote | **10** | s4dotaLUL Global Emote

Check the banner image for the current subreddit level. Once we reach that level, the talent with the more votes in their straw polls will be implemented for use on /r/tz. 

Vote on Talents:   
[Level 10](http://www.strawpoll.me/12649859)  
[Level 15](http://www.strawpoll.me/12649867)  
[Level 20](http://www.strawpoll.me/12649872)  
[Level 25](http://www.strawpoll.me/12649885)  

I sincerely hope that you enjoy the changes that we have been working on, as we are very excited to finally share them with you. For any questions or concerns please feel free to [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fleagueoflegends). 

May your memes no longer just be dreams,

/r/DotA2 2017 Census - Need help raising awareness, low user turnout|self.DotA2|~##/r/DotA2 2017 Survey 
Many of you may remember the [2015 /r/dota2 census](http://i.imgur.com/tfnM8SS.jpg) where we collected some data about our users and got some great feedback on how to move forward with the subreddit. Its two years later, and were looking to do something similar again! Like last time we have a google form, but this time around weve shrunk the size down to make it easier to complete. We would super appreciate your time over the next week to help us make the subreddit better for y'all.

###**[Link to the Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXMwrCELgADlzJRzk1SsfSuBvnXTt6h1L1H1s1VduxhWDGIA/viewform?usp=sf_link)**



______
If you have already helped fill out the survey thank you a ton for your time. However there is a relatively low turnout (5k vs 13k in 2015). 

I suspect that this is because there was only a sticky, which most people seem to ignore, and never a popular post about the survey. So thanks for the help fam.

The New Dota 2 Subreddit|self.DotA2|~As you've no doubt noticed if you browse /r/Dota2 with styles enabled, we've just implemented a major style update for the subreddit.  


We've wanted to make changes to the subreddit for some time, and it finally came together with some help from our friends over at /r/GlobalOffensive. We've built the new style off of their subreddit, and we really have got to thank /u/Jpon9 for all his help and time. Hopefully we can continue to work together do more stuff, linking our communities through both Valve and eSports.


We've finally brought in live streams into the sidebar so you can see when Arteezy is still streaming 20 hours later. Right now we only show Twitch streams, but if there's interest or a need in showing Azubu/Douya/MLG, we can work towards adding them as well.


One thing that we're still working on is automated match threads for live games. The system is still a work in progress, but were close, and hopefully we'll soon have a bot that will hook into the upcoming matches and make match threads for upcoming games in a consistent fashion.


A few weeks ago we ran a banner contest for TI with the promise of some Arcana flair. Unfortunately as this new design came together, we found we couldn't really make any of the submissions work on the new subreddit, but there we're still some favourites that we wanted to highlight. Congratulations to /u/bil08, /u/zekgames, and /u/shared_tango, who we will be contacting to find out what flair you'd like. As we move forward there will be more opportunities to participation and excellence as an /r/DotA2 community member.


We've worked hard on the new CSS and are pretty happy with how it looks, but realistically there are always things that could go wrong or need improvement. If you have any feedback or notice anything out of whack, please let us know and we'll look into it right away.

Hey, I run the podcast Bottle Crow, and we're havin' troubles|self.DotA2|~Heya, folks. My name's Colin, I run the Dota podcast Bottle Crow. We don't have a ton of listeners, but we've got a few, and I wanted to reach out in the hopes of reaching them. The podcast RSS feed is busted right now- really, really busted. So, in case there are some listeners out there, I wanna let you guys know what happened, and what we're doing about it.

Our RSS feed has been a pretty bootleg operation- we've been hosting it through Google Drive, and using a script to force it to work with a feed. It's always been a workaround, and there's always been the risk that Google would close the weird thing we're doing with their service. Well... they did. And it busted everything. I've wanted to figure out a better solution for some time, but it never felt urgent- it's working right now, so who cares? And obviously that meant that when it did break down, I had nothing prepared.

Ultimately, this is gonna be a good thing. We're getting Bottle Crow up on Soundcloud, at https://soundcloud.com/user-721620498/ and honest to god I am already wishing we'd done this earlier. It's slick as shit, and if I could have built it while the feed was working, and then switched us over as soon as it was done, that would have been great. I didn't. I take full responsibility, and I'm bummed I let you guys down.

But! You can listen to every episode on Soundcloud right now (!), we're going to put every episode up there going forward, and I'm figuring out how to set up a new RSS feed with Soundcloud so your podcast apps and iTunes can play nice with it just like before. Better, even, because I'm going to be doing more stuff with descriptions and tags and things to make the presentation better.

This has been the most rewarding thing I've ever worked on, and I really don't want it to fall apart because the RSS fucked up. So please, if you listen, if you know someone who does... let 'em know. We ain't gone, and we hope to have lots more stories about me Repelling enemies and general idiocy.

Thanks for reading. If there are any questions, I'll check back on this.

EDIT: Quick note, it's like 1:30 CST, and I'm replying to stuff as I have spare minutes at work. At 4 CST I go on lunch, and I'll binge reply to outstanding questions and comments- this can be a pseudo-AMA, I'm happy for any questions, comments, or feedback!

EDIT2: The Soundcloud has been updated! The description of every episode has its original release date right up top, and I've made a playlist that has all of the episodes in chronological order.~|announce

A letter from the owner of Team Freedom, and some special esports news|self.DotA2|~Hi all,

&nbsp;

First, I want to give a big thank you and congratulations to Stan King, Yawar, CCNC, Sneyking, and Flee for their exceptional performance on our road to TI7. Also, thank you to all our fansboth old and newfor your continued support. Even though we didnt make it to TI, we will learn and grow as players and as an organization.

&nbsp;

Many of you may not know, but I am also the founder of eSports.US, an organization dedicated to supporting charitable initiatives through competitive gaming. With the help from many of you, including /u/SirActionSlacks-, /u/GranDGranT, /u/ZrRock, /u/GoofyGG, a number of pro teams, and many others, we hosted several charity show matches to raise money for children. Team Freedom has also had a longstanding commitment to charity in which the organization is committed to donating a portion of proceeds to charity.

&nbsp;

I wanted to use this opportunity to let you know about something exciting that weve been working hard on since the beginning of the year. I am proud to publicly announce that eSports.US is now known as **The Esports Foundation, Inc.** and we are officially recognized as a **501(c)(3) public charity**and one of the first operating in esports. Our web site remains the same at [https://esports.us](https://esports.us)

&nbsp;

Our mission statement is:
> to provide relief and assistance to, and improve the quality of life for, children affected by poverty, emergencies, or health issues, using competitive video gaming as a platform to support our cause

&nbsp;

Well be starting to fund raise shortly through many of our planned events in Dota 2 and other games. We also have a booth at this years TwitchCon so please stop by to say hi if youre there.

&nbsp;

**Call to action!**
If anyone wants to help volunteer in any capacity, or if you have any ideas on how we can work together as a community to really show our charitable impact (i.e. remember this? [how to save the world through esports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpNzKGhbx8o)), or simply just want to contribute to our operational funding, please contact me. If you (or know someone who would) want to be a corporate sponsor, please really contact me :)

&nbsp;

Thank you,

Building off of a first iteration that saw the BTS house brimming with candid player moments, hot grills, gameplay that was SO SMART,  and the attention of over 4 million unique viewers, we're pleased to confirm that the Summit 2 LAN Finals will run from December 3 - 7.

Without the outpouring of support we received from the community for the first Summit, there was no way wed be able to pull this off again. Therefore, we look forward to rewarding our amazing fans with an extra day of play at the Finals, several special guests, and improved unique live events!

Further details about the format, invited teams, and qualifiers to be announced soon.

Statement from creator of Roshpit Champions|self.DotA2|~Hi Everyone,

Yesterday this thread was brought up to the top https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4au0yy/valve_the_first_custom_game_you_monetized_is_a/ and it generated a hailstorm of discussion. I made a mistake in responding as if I knew what I was talking about without having an actual understanding of how it works.

The truth is you are right, the workshop art belongs to the Artists. If this custom game is offering a Game Pass, it is not fair to the hours of time put into drawing the amazing images that you see in game.

So the following actions are being taken:

1. I am removing all unacceptable item icons from the game. I will push an update in a few hours. Once it is live all items that have icons from the workshop will only have a generic image. We will slowly recover item images by curating our own content. This is the only fair way to do it.

2. I want to apologize to all the artists who I did not consult in using their amazing works. They spend hours pouring their hearts into this creative content and it is unfair to showcase them within Roshpit Champions with no credit to them.

I would like to clarify that everything other than the item icons taken from the Workshop (and the WoW screencap which was removed last night) is allowed to be included in the game -> I mention this because it seemed like a sentiment was brewing that the entire game was a Rip-Off, which is an unfair accusation given how much time has gone into generating the rest of the content.

For anyone that's interested, I'll do a stream tonight on Twitch and maybe we can come up with some new ideas for icon art together. 

If there are any professional artists who might be interested in this project, please contact me and perhaps we can reach a deal.

The First DOTA2 Tournament in Korea - GOMTV|self.DotA2|~Hello DOTA2 users,

I feel somewhat nervous as this is my first time to write a post on DOTA 2 community.




My name is Chae Jung Won (aka Mr.Chae) and I am in charge of eSports at GOMTV in Korea.

Those of you who enjoyed StarCraft II may know already, that we have been providing English commentary and stream of numerous eSports contents produced in Korea for the benefit of oversea viewers.

We have been broadcasting SC II and World of Tank league and fans all around the world are enjoying our contents.

In addition to this, we will be producing eSports contents through DOTA 2 which is gaining huge popularity around the world.

Out first league will be NSL which will launch on July 6th at 1PM KST.

This is a league in which Korean publisher of DOTA 2, Nexon and GOMTV are hosting together, and in addition to Korean commentary, we will also provide English and Chinese commentary.

DOTA 2 scene in Korea is in a beginning stage yet, and there is gap in experience with teams that participate and win awards at The International.

However, I have faith that once DOTA 2 officially launches in Korea, many new tournaments will spring and Korean teams will improve fast in skill.

You may not be able to see many Korean teams in coming The International, but look forward to 2014 to see them.
(Foreign teams be prepared :p)

The reason I am writing this post today, is to provide guide to our first DOTA 2 contents, NSL, which many oversea viewers are showing interest, on how to watch it.

The champion of this NSL, will gain the right to participate in DOTA 2 The International in August. 

Please see below, for more information :
