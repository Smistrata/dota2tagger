The Dota 2 workshop and its ecosystem are dying: here's why|self.DotA2|~Hello everyone. This thread was written collectively by many artists of the Dota Workshop community, and were going to talk about a few serious issues that have, as of late, severely hurt it.

First off, let us say that we all love the Workshop and deeply appreciate that Valve has created an environment where artists can contribute to games that are held in such high regard by the community. It is amazing to see how high the bar for quality has been raised since the early days of the Workshop. With no time constraints and a competitive environment, we are able to take pride in our work and set our own deadlines to produce the highest quality assets possible. 

Second, we'd like to dispel the notion that Workshop artists are millionaires. Most of us have, until now, been able to make a decent living, and it's been a comparable, sometimes superior alternative to freelance work for those of us who have been successful at it. We will get to the real draw and appeal of the Workshop later down this thread.

Third, for those unaware, **heres a quick summary of how the Steam Workshop works for Dota 2**. Artists can create item sets for your favorite heroes, couriers, wards, etc. and if, after the community votes on it, Valve decides they want to put your item in the game, you receive a portion of the sales of your item, or the chest your item is in. If your item or item set goes into a treasure chest that had 10 things total in it (e.g. 8 sets, 1 ward, 1 courier), you get 1/10th of the artists share (by default, 25%) of the net profits of that treasure. If you got 2 things (e.g. 1 courier + 1 set) in that 10-things chest, you get 2/10ths. Rarity does not factor into this. Once an item is accepted, its out of the artists hands, and it is *entirely* up to Valve to determine how and specifically in which way it is sold, bundled, implemented, and whether they want to make modifications to it (e.g. particles). 

So. As we've said, there are big issues happening in Workshop land, and we have been unable to get a response from Valve about it. Many artists are becoming disheartened, feeling like we have no recourse (besides talking about it, hence this thread), and as such, many feel it is time to move on from the Workshop entirely, and many already have. Some of us have been a part of the Workshop since the beginning seven years ago, and have been part of the Valve games community through modding long before that. Promoting the growth of the Workshop as a unique opportunity for game artists is something weve invested years into, and the last thing we want is to see this unique concept disappear.  

**Now, let's take a step back and look at this issue's origin, and how it got to this point.**


* * *


# PART 1: BETWEEN TI5 AND THE BOSTON MAJOR

After TI5, in the fall of 2015, Valve announced there would be three Dota 2 Major tournaments around the world leading up to TI6. Workshop artists were excited by this prospect. It finally promised more structure to treasure chest releases, something that, during 2015, had become almost entirely controlled by third party tournaments. It looked like Majors would revitalize and improve not only the Dota 2 competitive scene, but also the way cosmetic items would be sold!

Shortly after the announcement, e-mails rolled out for the first Fall 2015 Major treasure. This was unusual at the time, because Valve would usually just put your set in the game without the need to notify you. The reason they needed to notify you for this was because you were now required to agree to give them half of your 25% share of the revenue, bringing our share down to 12.5%, **while introducing a different way to split the revenue among artists**.


With the Majors system, our work is included either as part of the Battle Pass itself (level-up gifts, quest path rewards), or in its treasure chests.

How does it work? All artists who are included in the Battle Pass and its treasures earn a portion of the 12.5% of the profits, that is to say, the treasure sales AND the sales of the Pass itself, regardless of whether their item is a quest path reward, a chest item, or a level-up drop; profits from the Pass and the treasures are thrown in a global pool.


EDIT HERE TO FURTHER CLARIFY: if a solo artist made a courier that got included as a level up reward, if another solo artist made a set that got selected to be a quest reward in the Pass, and if yet another solo artist made a set that was included in one of the treasure chests, then all of these artists get paid the same amount. If there were 100 items included overall across the pass and the treasure chests, each of these items awards 1/100th of the "global revenue pool" of the artist's share (12.5%) of the major's profits, to the artist or artists who created the item. And obviously, if you got more than one item in the pass/chests, then you get your part of the 1/100th for each item you worked on (or all of the 1/100th, if you worked solo, but solo artists are very rare).

(we realize this may sound complicated but it's in fact a very cool simplified system)

**This was a really great and fair system to all the artists**, since the sales of the later chests logically cant reach the sales of the earlier chests of the Majors timeframe, and more importantly because the level-up rewards in the Pass include at least one of every treasure. By the time the 3rd and 4th treasures are released, many of the owners of the Pass have already earned several of the chests and therefore buy fewer of them. However, since all artists are part of this Pass "pool revenue system", regardless of when their item (and its treasure chest) is made available, artists are still fairly and equitably compensated; the revenue is evened out across items.

Everyone involved ended up doing just as well as they would have on any other Valve treasure release, because, as expected, the Battle Pass and its associated treasures sold quite well. **There were lots of positivity regarding the structure of this new standard** going forward because some much needed stability was implied.

As 2016 crept up, things were still working out all right on our end. People were getting paid similarly to what they would expect, Valve appeared to have delivered some semblance of structure and control that many had asked over the course of 2015. We did, however, start to lose some artists because of the significant gap between opportunities to break in and get paid. If you didn't get anything into one of these Majors, you were going six to eight months without income. 

Then they failed to produce anything for the Spring 2016 Major. It's understandably difficult to plan for something being held so close to the massive effort that is TI6, and they've remedied that particular issue for 2017. Not a problem in and of itself at the time if you already had items accepted in previous Majors, but we'll get back to this later on.

With Valve forgetting to invite Workshop artists at TI6 until the last possible minute, meaning that few people could make it *(note: they fixed this for TI7, invites are already out)*, and the lack of any Workshop-related events at Key Arena, most of us became concerned about what the future of the Workshop was going to be like.


* * *


# PART 2: THE NEW SYSTEM

Enter the Fall 2016 Major. E-mails have become the standard Workshop agreement at this point. With the Majors being the only real opportunities to get anything in-game, you're basically forced to agree to these terms.

The alternative is having already worked for months on submissions that will never get in-game because these are your only opportunities. **Unless you like working for free, you can only say yes to the e-mails, always.** Valve holds all the power in this situation, artists have zero leverage, but for the most part, until this point it had been working out for everyone involved.

When the sales data became available to us for the Fall 2016 Major *(note: it only becomes available once every single item thats part of the global revenue pool has been added to the game, that is to say, once the last chest is released)*, most Workshop artists became suspicious of the much lower than expected numbers, and on close inspection, **it became clear that, unlike before, we had not been compensated in any way for the Battle Pass sales, even though they were a very significant part to the total amount paid out to Workshop artists.**

At first, some of us thought this was a mistake that would later be remedied. When contacted, the Dota 2 team quickly made it very clear that this was intentional, but declined to answer any questions or concerns. They have continued to ignore us since.

However, we were absolutely and undeniably a part of the Battle Pass! Not only **people needed to buy the Pass [before they were allowed to purchase](http://i.imgur.com/lrpnoTV.png) its treasures**, but [our contributions were prominently featured](http://i.imgur.com/0Qlwvtl.jpg) inside of it.

And of course, dont forget that the treasures, where the bulk of the artists work is present, **[were given out as rewards](http://i.imgur.com/GzhTMzk.png)** when players level up their Battle Pass. By level 60, owners of the Battle Pass had no less than **17 treasure drops**, in addition to 5 community-made courier/ward drops. 

We feel that the Battle Pass relies heavily on our work and that it makes little sense for artists that have contributed all its cosmetic items to not see a cent of it anymore.

And with the Pass not contributing to the revenue pool being paid to contributors, **this effectively means that the artists who created any items that were only available in the Pass (anything not in chests) have been paid by further diluting other artists revenue**. 

While its hard to estimate the exact amount of money that we are losing out on, we can tell you that the Battle Pass sales contributed to roughly half of the revenue pool paid out to artists. It removed more than half of the available income from the Major and gave it to Valve, on top of the half Valve already claims for the sake of funding the Major. Without exaggeration, we went from a 25% revenue share to roughly 6% over the course of a single year.

The same issues continued through the Winter 2017 Battle Pass with even worse results. Not only does this Pass only have three treasure chests instead of four, but the sales for these three chests are *significantly lower* than last year. **For example, even if you got 3 times as many items in the Winter 2017 major compared to Winter 2016, you'd only be getting half the money. This means things are effectively 6 times worse as before**, and to say this hurts the viability of the Workshop for artists would be a massive understatement.

This is information that we wish to put out there not only for the members of this community, but also other artists who have not been in the know about what has been happening, or who have considered joining the Workshop because they heard lots of great things about it.


* * *


# PART 3: THE VIABILITY OF THE WORKSHOP

With only 2 majors serving as opportunities to get something in the game, and a single Collector's Cache in TI, all spaced some 4 months apart, you're going 4 months between opportunities for income, and missing even one event is something most full-time artists can not survive. **When the resulting pay is then no longer substantial enough once you finally do get something in, who will be left to produce the kind of quality and quantity of content required to fill treasures and fund Majors?**

In the midst of all this, the Call to Arms for TI7 has just been announced, and it is aquatic- themed. There is nothing wrong with a themed Call to Arms event, but when it's for the TI7 Collector's Cache, and we know that's the only chest that's going to be released within the next 5 months, what do we do with the sets we've been working on and have released since the beginning of the year with hopes of making the Collector's Cache? It's hard to get excited for something that nullifies the chances of getting anything you've worked on so far into the only available chest until the unannounced Fall 2017 Major, an event that may or may not happen, that you will not get paid for until January 2018, almost a year from now.

On top of that, it's hard to imagine that Valve will not find a way to claim a bigger share of the Collector's Cache than expected, because that's exactly what happened with the New Bloom / Lunar New Year 2017 event. Everyone was led to believe the Lunar New Year chest(s) would be sold separately, and compensated for, without the 12.5% Major funding cut going to Valve. Instead, it was pushed into the Winter 2017 Battle Pass, with the results we mentioned above.

We have heard people claim the Workshop was never intended to be a full-time job. Not only has Valve touted it as a full-time job through articles in the past and the revenue they've distributed to artists, but that revenue is the biggest thing that has kept the Workshop competitive and productive enough to be successful as a funding engine for Dota 2 for all these years. It has attracted and continued to enjoy AAA talent for that reason, talent that is now forced to exit the Workshop because it is no longer viable compared to other work. It has always been a huge risk, but the Workshop only functions when the rare payouts you only have a small chance to get are worth the extensive work you have to produce to get those opportunities.

We've tried continuously to reach out to the Dota 2 team, Gabe Newell and Erik Johnson about these concerns over the past six months, but we have received no response.

It has been particularly hard to read quotes like this being released in the midst of trying and failing to get answers for why the Dota 2 team is digging further and further into our revenue:


**_"The scarce commodity here is not money -- it's how many hours there are in a day"_**

In this quote from an interview with Gamasutra, Gabe Newell is being honest; we have no doubt of that. In fact, our only hope, lately, has been that maybe he would see what's going on and take some action to preserve the Workshop, as he has always seemed like an enthusiastic proponent of UGC as a business model.

The CS:GO Workshop is still being run (and monetized) successfully without any cuts to artist revenue, and in fact, those artists have typically always earned more than Dotas.


Artists have increasingly been giving up on the Dota Workshop over the past six months. Everyone has been reluctant to speak publicly about what's going on. A fear of the consequences of speaking out has been a very real thing. The Dota 2 team has, over the past year, become increasingly faceless, unresponsive and impossible to communicate with.

**Why do some of us care so much?**

Because we truly believe that the Workshop is the most incredible engine for funding a free-to-play game that has ever been conceived, and some of us have been a cheerleader for the model to everyone we've met since we started contributing to the game. It's a completely community driven effort on both the side of the creators and the consumers. It is, at its best, a successful signature product of Valve experimentation and implementation, something that should be nourished and grown, cared for and held up as a legitimately amazing form of a successful UGC driven economy.

It has empowered 3D and 2D designers, both amateur and professional, to take full charge of their own designs and compete in an environment filled with other top-grade artists from around the world. It has given artists who might have problems fitting into a standard rigid work schedule, for reasons physical, medical, or mental, a platform on which they can not only support themselves, but thrive.

We've always assumed the success of Workshop artists, the community, and Dota 2 as both a game and an esport, would all go hand-in-hand. It has become depressingly clear over the past eight months that Valve, or elements within Valve, think this is not the case.

If the Workshop was to fail as a full-time job prospect, we would expect and want that to be a result of a market dive, the failure of cosmetics we create to drive the economy of Dota 2, and not seemingly artificially imposed cuts to our share of the revenue to line other pockets or avenues for undisclosed reasons.

**After all the above, for many of us, the Call to Arms for the TI7 Collector's Cache represents a final breaking point of the Dota 2 Workshop.** Those of us who manage to get something in it may be able to continue doing this through the year into a further uncertain future. Those of us who don't are going to have to call it quits.

We dont have any sort of leverage, and we have essentially been ignored by Valve. And some of us fear that, if we were to continue to press the issue with them, we might get essentially blacklisted from the Steam Workshop, so we have been left with little choice but to bring this matter to your attention directly, in a collective manner.

We hope that, with attention brought to this issue, we can see some systemic change, and even maybe a better future for Dota cosmetics as a whole. Thank you for reading!

After almost a year of work, we are finally ready to launch our CARRY OMNIKNIGHT set with something no one else has done before, a full Alt Voice Pack! Come take a look!|self.DotA2|~One year ago at Ti4 I went around to all of the workshop artists carrying this [very high quality hand drawn omni set](http://imgur.com/PEk041V). Many laughed, but one decided that they would give it a go. After [several attempts and discussions](http://imgur.com/UXz1FuS), it is finally ready. 

**HERE IS THE SET!**

[IMMORTALIS!](http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=505305858)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inspired by a fusion of Greek and Roman military units, the set was beautifully crafted by Chemical Alia and Drysocket and features 2 different head styles, one with a sweet helm and another with the signature badass bandanna. I know that a lot of people want only the flashiest and cumbersome sets in now-a-days, but I wanted something that would look like it would fit but have a really cool design in the world of Dota 2. Hopefully you agree that we succeeded! 

Also you get nips! Sweet, sweet nips.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But thats not all folks. 

For the last several weeks I have been sneaking off to do a alternate voice pack to co release with the set. I have a sample here for you to enjoy.

[Take a listen!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRV3iz5hCNY)

Im a big lore nerd so I tried to explain why omni's voice went all crazy when the set is on, so feel free to check out my lore on the Immortalis workshop page and lemme know what you think. 

We have made several alternate versions of each voice line and have added in several custom trigger events as well. this includes 

-around 400-450 total lines 

-around 14 hours of studio recording 

-all original lines redone in the Immortalis voice 

-alternates to all lines custom made for Immortalis 

-healing lines for most heros (activates when healing heros that work well with omni) and eventually all heros 

-kill lines for most heros and eventually all heros (up to 3 per hero) 

-custom trigger lines (such as healing a friend with very low health, killing a enemy who just killed allies, repeling a enemy, and hundreds more) 

-custom item lines with a emphisis on items that are typically built on omniknight 

-so much more. so very much more. 

If my dream could come true I would have it be unlocked for anyone who wore the full set and it would be toggleable on and off. Also it would be client side only (like announcers). 

Anyhow, the voice pack is a new idea no one has tried before, but if it gets good reception we will expedite our release. 

**also if you have any good lines feel free to post them, I have 1 more recording session in me! if we use it we will credit you. WHOO**

well thanks for looking and hopefully voting, this dream set has been a long time coming! Please let us know what you think!

Snow Brawl (dota 2 custom game) getting attacked by phantom downvotes. Valve please help|self.DotA2|~Our development team has spent the last two months hard at work building and testing our game Snow Brawl for the Frostivus entry.  Whether we win or lose we really just want people to enjoy and play our game.  We released our game on Monday and currently have 368 subscribers, prior to today had an approval rating of 80% and a 4 out of 5 stars which is a huge success in our minds.   However, sometime between last night and today our game has received over 500 additional negative votes against us.  Which seems impossible since we've only had 400 unique subscribers in total.  

We have already submitted a ticket to Valve's Support but have yet to get a response. However,  I know Valve frequently reads /r/dota2,  So we are hoping this post can get upvoted enough to get Valve's attention.   Even if you didn't like our game, or even custom games in general, it shouldn't matter. 

All we're asking is to simply up vote this post so we can be heard and are game to be judged fairly, and not buried behind these phantom votes.

If I knew we'd get this much attention, I would have sabotaged the game myself. (just joking, those tin foil hat's look great on you guys).  At this time we still haven't heard from Valve, but we have been made aware the Frostivus competition has been extended to the 11/24, hopefully, this will give Valve more time to sort this out.~|workshop

Creating cosmetics for pro players is an awful idea for artists|self.DotA2|~Hey, Workshop artists u/ChemicalAlia and u/Drysocket here.  This morning, we were contacted by the manager of a well-known pro player about having a custom set made for him.  This reminded us about just how terrible of an idea it is for artists to work with players/teams/other organizations in the current Workshop environment, and we thought that we should make a thread to talk about that in more detail, maybe bounce some ideas off of Dota Reddit to see what you all thought towards a solution.  Disclaimer:  There are some awesome pros and personalities who are a pleasure to work with; and making a decision to work with anybody is yours and yours alone.  Were only speaking from a logical standpoint.

&nbsp;

**Here are the main two issues, which well elaborate on below:**
1: Player sets are bundled in chests, so you cant support the player directly.
2: The benefits that you gain from working with pros are basically nonexistent and not worth the revenue cut you give them. Honestly speaking, its charity work.

&nbsp;

**To artists:** If youve made something for a pro player/team/3rd party Dota person, and it gets accepted, congratulations!  Youve probably just given a sizeable chunk of your revenue away and got nothing in return for it.  If thats your rent or mortgage for the next few months or year, oh boy, we feel that feels. 

Artists at one point were, but are no longer credited anywhere in the store for their work.  There is no way for the customer to know that a given set is FOR said pro player/team.  It's just some random set, in some chest.  In the past, that was one of the main justifications for giving a large chunk of money to that organization: the expectation that their name will be able to pull in more sales on the store from supporters in return for that revenue split.

&nbsp;

**What orgs may promise you in exchange for their revenue cut and why it isnt worth it to the artist:**

   * An expedited path to getting a set accepted with standards lowered because of their magic Valve connections.  While two or so years ago, that definitely did work (to an abusively successful level), that is fortunately no longer the case. There are no shortcuts now (Please send all known shortcuts to: ValveAddPlz@gmail.com).

   * Exposure to help build your reputation as a workshop artist. Ask yourself, however, when was the last time you saw a workshop artist become successful/popular BECAUSE of their collaborations with 3rd parties?  From what weve seen, the credit usually goes straight to the player/team itself, unless the artist is already very established.

&nbsp;

Weve seen player sets on the workshop with literally 4, 5, 6+ ARTISTS on them.  To these artists, wed advise you to really consider how much youre actually getting out of the deal, and if it is really worth whatever percent youre giving away to what essentially amounts to charity.

&nbsp;

Also, don't look to popular artists making player sets as a sign that it's a great idea. Some of them have already made enough money to retire many times over, and since money is not an issue they are free to be do whatever the hell they want.

&nbsp;

In reality, you will be relying solely on Workshop exposure, the entire premise of which has been slowly deteriorating over the past year and a half due to its own usability issues.  We may as well admit that THIS is the Workshop now:

&nbsp;

http://i.imgur.com/512bC44.jpg

&nbsp;

Even still, it can take many months and sometimes years for sets to get in, so by the time something actually gets added, itll probably be long forgotten unless its one of the most memorable sets on the Workshop ever.  Hopefully Valve is aware of this, as popularity on the Workshop rarely seems to be a factor in their selection process for accepting sets.

&nbsp;

The bottom line is, working with a pro/team/org will probably not be worth it to you.  In this current environment, you need to seriously ask yourself if the kind of revenue splits that are commonly expected is worth giving away, for all of the work that you do.  A lot of these team/player managers who negotiate the deals are businesspeople, and many of the Workshop artists are naive kids/new to the game industry and have no business experience.  One could argue rightfully that its even a bit predatory.  Protect yourself, your art, and know that youre doing them a favor, not the other way around.

&nbsp;

**How to improve things?**

We have some ideas, but want to know what suggestions the community and other artists may have about this problem.  

&nbsp;


For example, it would be worth seeing what would happen if Valve started releasing player sets to the store instead of including them in chests, which defeats the entire purpose.  Perhaps they could expand on the Pro Store to include player sets and make a stronger push towards marketing them.  It seemed like that was originally the direction Valve was going, but stopped somewhere along the line.

&nbsp;

Regarding artists shouldering all of the financial burden and risk: What if the revenue situation was like how Valve now handles tournaments, in which a certain percent of the players take comes from the artist and that same amount is matched by Valve?  This could even be standardized to prevent gouging from either side.

&nbsp;

Alternately, what if contributions to the players/teams was handled more like the Service Provider system?

&nbsp;

**Final thoughts:**

What do you guys even think about the idea of player sets in general?  Is it stupid?  Awesome?  Did you always support them?  Do you now?  If player sets are not even a thing anymore, then thats all the more reason for artists to take note.

&nbsp;

It sucks seeing artists screwed over because the system has changed in such a way that it only hurts them.  Some things that were a great idea several years ago no longer are, and because the Workshop is constantly evolving, you have to constantly re-evaluate your plan if you want to stay afloat.  Weve been doing this since the inception of the Workshop and have all too often learned that the hard way, so we just want to pass on a little of what weve learned. 

&nbsp;

Weve always believed that the Workshop could be an amazing alternate opportunity for game artists outside of studio work.  Although there are some big issues right now that are preventing it from being as awesome as it should be, we want to see it prosper.

&nbsp;

P.S. This is only tangentially related, but important to note:  If you are an artist who works with any 3rd party organization, we STRONGLY advise that you specify early in your correspondence that you own the artwork, not them.  This is **very important** from a legal standpoint. There are many ways that things can go badly, and you need to be able to pull out if necessary and keep the work you have made.  Things often go south one way or another, and OWNERSHIP is something that the artist needs to make apparent a.s.a.p.

Official System Shock 2 SHODAN Announcer pack in the works. We need your help!|self.DotA2|~Greetings /r/DotA2,

My name is [Stephen Kick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smkick) and I'm the CEO of [Night Dive Studios](http://www.nightdivestudios.com/), we are responsible for bringing back many classic PC games to Steam, our most notable title being [System Shock 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/238210/). We're all big DotA fans and after attending TI4 this year we began thinking about ways we could blend our love of classic games and DotA.

One of our better ideas was creating a **SHODAN** announcer pack. If you aren't familiar, SHODAN is the rogue artificial intelligence that taunts, and misdirects you as you roam her halls on board the doomed spaceship Von Braun. [She has a very iconic voice and her dialog is bone chilling.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGEjKoGHzO0)



We've been in contact with Terri (the voice of SHODAN), and Eric Brosius (Sound engineer from SS2) and they are both on board with the project.

We also proposed the idea to Valve, but before diving right into production they asked us to approach **you**, the DotA2 community to get your opinion. Would you be interested in a SHODAN announcer pack? Would it be too similar to Valve's own GLaDOS announcer? Do you have any suggestions on how we can best represent both System Shock 2, and DotA2? Do you have any ideas, or maybe specific lines you'd like to hear?


Please give us your honest opinion! We want to create the best announcer pack we can and we can't do it without you. If you haven't played System Shock 2, and would like to give it a go, send me a PM. I'll be giving away keys to the first 25 messages I receive.

**edit: The keys are gone! Thanks to everyone who responded!**

**edit#2: Thanks for the gold!**

**edit#3: 12/10/14 We have started production!**

**edit#4: 3/12/15 Looking for ideas for SS2 wards and couriers! Please post and share your thoughts!**

Workshop Drama|self.DotA2|~For those of you who don't know me: I'm the creator of the PubSimulator bots.


After seeing the top Reddit post here about the Shutnik bots (called Rage Trigger), I got curious and checked his code out. When I was reading his code, it reminded me of AdamQQQ's "Ranked Matchmaking AI" (if you haven't subscribed to AdamQQQ, do it, I think his bots are the best ones in the workshop, hands down). At first, I thought this is just the shrine usages (as he has said it in his post), but after looking at other files, I realized that he has basically copy pasted the code of almost **58 out of 115** heroes from AdamQQQ as well as all of AdamQQQ changes in the bot behaviors (he has removed the AdamQQQ's name from all of the files of course, which is literally the only difference).


Until now you might say "alright, probably he forgot to mention this", which is still not fine, but could be an honest mistake. After seeing this, I got curious about the other heroes that "he" has implemented. After some investigations, I realized that the **heroes that haven't been copy-pasted from AdamQQQ's code, are a copy paste from "BOT EXPERIMENT Credit:FURIOUSPUPPY"** (BTW. most people don't know this, but Furious Puppy is not the main author of those bots, the guy who wrote BOT EXPERIMENT used some of Furious Puppy's code and this is his weird way of referencing him). I should also mention, Shutnik has made some changes (from what I see, it is only what items should bots buy and their leveling up order, which is a quite trivial task if you are familiar with bot scripting), but in no way he is the main author of the bots (and I also didn't go through other codes in the workshop, maybe these are also someone else's code. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if this is the case).


How can you check these claims:


- When you subscribe to "BOT EXPERIMENT Credit:FURIOUSPUPPY", you can find his code in "...\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\570\837040016".
- When you subscribe to "Ranked Matchmaking AI", you can find his code in "...\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\570\855965029".
- You can find Shutnik's code in his post (which is still on the front page as I'm writing this).
- Open any of the "ability-item-usage-*.lua" files from the Shutnik bots, you can see it has been copy-pasted from one of the above. Other files are mostly copied from AdamQQQ.


Final words: there is not a problem with using someone else's code, as some of the other bots in the workshop are doing this, but not referencing someone else's work properly is not fine, especially when you have copy pasted more code from them than that you have written yourself. I am friend with some of the bot scripters and they sometimes compain to me about the fact that someone can just copy their work (which has happened many times before, but to no success) and the workshop doesn't have a system to catch plagiarism. Another reason why I made this post is that AdamQQQ is Chinese and "! " (creator of bot experiment) is Russian, so they may not know about the Shutnik's Reddit post and his bots.

Edit: if I get a response from any of the involved parties I'll include it here.

- Shutnik's response:

"Dramma? Cool. Ok, lets see:
Arizona is not a russian, he just learn this language and choose a russian nickname. Jokes on you.
I used a lot of his code, and mentioned that in a post, am i?
And btw he was listed before in a workshop page, but decided to un-mod himself from my project. Sadly, reasons unknown.
Script is changed a lot since then, bots have learned how to lane properly, how to push, how to everything basically.
Arizona's bots have default behavior. This is even in a description.
New bots, such as Lycan, Balanar, etc etc, think exactly like a default. Except warding and rune logic, which is global.
They can use spells and learn tallents, and thats great, and this is the reason why they used.
Compare it to my script now, and say they are the same in their behavior.
About adamQQQ: i did take some of his scripts, (and did mention it) cuz there is no need to re-invent a wheel, if his bots doing damn good about shrines or whatever, i'll take it.
Some of his bots have a behavior rules, applied to one bot.
I did the job to make all this special moments work together for every bot. His, and Furious Puppy, and Arizona's.
Plagiarizm
Please, be fair. If you dig enough to find out this code something alike of Arizona's, dig also in my VK.
In my group, i was releasing updates continiously. Check the dates, when i released updates.
My work was used in other bots scripts, and i have nothing against it. Go on and take it, i dont mind, it is open sourced.
Because we do it for free, for a community. And there is no reason to bark at each other, trying to hide your stuff one from another.
If authors somehow disagree with it, and want to made a holy war based on nothing, for nothing, well, ill take it.
Get rid of the "alien" code, eventually.
On the other side, i can ask for the same. But i will not."

- My thoughts:

No he did not just use "some" of AdamQQQ's code, he has copied almost all of his code (again, you can check it for yourself). Also read this carefully: "I did the job to make all this special moments work together for every bot. His, and Furious Puppy, and Arizona's.", which basically mean I got their code and put them together, which again, you can judge for yourself whether his post was in any way implying.

- AdamQQQ's Response:

Hi every one, I'm the author of "Ranked Matchmaking AI".
"I just knew about it, it was a bit too bad.
I checked Shutnik bots codes by notepad++ compare plugin. Surprisingly, in addition to the licenses and comments, the other is exactly the same. Remove these comments, can be said to be a big project.
All of us know what is open source, which great to promote the development of computer science. Every could use others code with a reference or other licenses (such as GPL). In my script description, I aslo written this words. (You are free to use all of the codes for any non-commercial purposes you choose, with a reference to the original Author. Do not use any of the files here for any program which is not open source and free to use.)
Sorry, I don't know much about GPL. But in this time, Shutnik not only copied my own code, but also copied a lot of other people (include Improved Default Bots by v33 and so on), without a reference. Although he mentioned my name, but is only a great shrine solution and S.B. scripts? Some times, I want to implement some new heroes, but in workshop, I couldn't found something new in hero ability usage. They all look like BOT EXPERIMENT's copy.
In the end, I already read all of posts there.Although I did not understand it all with my poor English. Because I don't understand slang and abbreviation. I only understand the formal English. Thanks to PLATINUM_DOTA and everyone who care the bot script."

On this Frostivus Night, I would be eternally grateful if you could give our Frostivus Entry a shot, before it's forgotten forever. It's a high difficulty horde mode in the style of Left 4 Dead with changing objectives as you go through 4 different Acts.|self.DotA2|~[The Second Day of Frostivus](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1197063942)

*Every year, the first night of Frostivus passed peacefully. On the second day Frostivus was canceled. But not this year. As Roshan is delivering the presents he is attacked and his sleigh is shot out of the air. The heroes from the Dire and Radiant decide to form a truce to work together to help Roshan and make sure that this year, Frostivus will finally happen. And so the unlikely alliance sets out to defeat the horde of Greevils and help Roshan fix his sleigh, find the lost presents and deliver them to all the good boy and girls. Maybe you'll even find out who is behind these attacks and stop them for good.*

The Second Day of Frostivus is a 5 player cooperative horde mode in which you are tasked with completing various objectives while fighting back a horde of Greevils and various special and boss units. The game takes about 30 minutes to complete but because of the high difficulty don't expect to be able to do it on the first try. [Bulldog couldn't.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyEy0t1Z16I)

We worked very hard on this game. A team of 12 people all put their heart and soul into this to deliver an experience with custom music, custom artwork, a custom tileset for the map, custom items and carefully handcrafted balance to make the game be challenging but still fair.

I would be overjoyed if you could give the game a shot while it's still topical and playable. It's highly likely future patches will destroy it and we aren't likely to be able to maintain it to keep it playable. If you enjoyed Dark Moon, Siltbreaker or Wraith Night, then this should be right down your alley. So grab 4 friends and see if you can make it all the way to the end and beat the mysterious final boss.

I really hope you enjoy the game. I am very proud of it. And I am very proud of my team for being able to complete it in time.

Have a good day.~|workshop

One last plea from the Custom Game Community. Give us another week and we'll give you better games.|self.DotA2|~This topic has been thoroughly discussed so I'll keep it short.

Valve, please extend the deadline for the Frostivus Custom Game contest by one week. Just one week would allow us to do so much more and let us polish our games a bit. And it really can't delay the Frostivus release by much.

I am not the only member of the custom game community asking for this. So this is where I request that the other members of the community leave a comment in this thread. Let us come together and show Valve that we ask this as a community.

For anyone lacking [context](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7b1mo1/707_and_the_frostivus_custom_game_contest/).

Edit: So I am just going to put this here I guess. I want to make clear that I am not trying to get some sort of competitive advantage here. I genuinely thought that the majority of developers were on board with this because last time I posted about this people largely agreed as well as conversations I had in private. The voices on here are more split. If I am alone in wanting this extension, then we should not have it. I was just trying to help. (I also want to clarify that our game will be done within the deadline, I just want another week for polish)~|workshop

Dragon's Ascension: Set for Dragon Knight|self.DotA2|~Hi Reddit!

I nervously present you with the spiritual successor to the Father of Dragons set I made last year.  The amount of love that set has gotten has meant a lot to me, and I would like to thank everyone who has suggested I re-design the set and submit it on my own.

Now that I'm no longer bound by the narrow restrictions a fully evolving set presents, I think this version is better executed and better designed than the previous set.

I'm planning on some more heavy duty work on the loading screen, and a dragon form to accompany the set is coming soon!  Please take a look and let me know what you think!

Frog Witch Doctor? Artist here, please read!|self.DotA2|~I thought I would come out and clear things up, I'm a transparent person so I'll just tell it as it is, I might mention things that should probably be private.


I see a thread about it pop up every now and then, and I am extremely pleased you guys like it, there's alot of misinformation going around about it - a big game of telephone I suppose.

&nbsp;


**Going down the timeline here -**

- The ingame ward only has 1 animation (It's a tree), the importer has 3 (spawn, attack, die), when you import it only plays the attack - this was Initially the problem with the set (Easy solution would be to blend our animations into a single one, thats how I made a preview video showing the ward in game working... Communication?)
This is why it was delayed at first. I think this was fixed? We got as we got asked for something else.
- We got notified that we need to create a low violence (LV) loadscreen for China (We also got asked to make low violence ward fx, even though we didn't use ward FX, the default skull is Valves and their LV is a air ball, which looks a bit lame to be fair)
- At this point I spoke to my concept artist, FX was hot and our Frog was the most succesful rated item ever as you can see here, it peaked at 23k, still 99% likes before workshop overhaul https://twitter.com/Mig_Dota/status/499242009203191808

&nbsp;

We decided we could make cool FX for the ward and possibly casket, that would work for both China and rest of the world, Here is a preview, the idea is that he summons his  stronger, magical spiritual self (Heavily inspired from Diablo3 Acid blob, won't even deny it)

&nbsp;

**Loadscreen** http://i.imgur.com/q02sucO.jpg

**Custom Icons** http://i.imgur.com/3EnKfXa.jpg

**Screenshot** http://i.imgur.com/exNzy9Y.jpg

(Those were WIP's, can't seem to find a vid preview of final)

&nbsp;

The response on the FX was that it can only be considered once the **source 2.0** rolls out (same thing with Mushi QoP, expected it), we were ok with it, we try to make cool things and have fun, people already wanted the frog, imagine if they get extra FX as a nice surprised.

&nbsp;

So now we just waited, but something happened, somewhere along the line it was decided that the set is "poorly executed", and the wood / frog eyes are repetitive and it needs a new pass, I was extremely confused at first.

&nbsp;

http://i.imgur.com/wbZcMyZ.jpg

**I made this image** to show fellow artists and get opinions, UV maps and up close. Majority said they think its weird feedback, biggest comment was more **depth** on the actual planks which is very valid - even moreso from the ingame view, the initial feedback we got was very vague and attempt at getting more detail was ignored.

&nbsp;

Oddly enough - at this point a organization contacted me about adding it to their tournament, when I expressed the feedback Valve gave me, the tournament said they could probably push it in (Organizations?).  I just didn't agree  with the % split, and apologize that players don't have a frog to kill people with.

&nbsp;

After a long night of sleep and a clear head me and my partner spoke again and came to the conclusion of the feedback from valve and artists we spoke to, lets add more cloth (Break up between wood), few new elements (Reduce frog eye copout), more breakup on wood with patterns / shapes, and chunkier wood (Thick, big, points of focus) instead of thin and smooth, so we can really push in detail, even from the in-game cam (Possibly neglected this too much and focused on tight zoomed in pixels)

&nbsp;

**Here is the current designs** we will be going with, the frog was always the core of the set, and we made the mistake of letting it **overshadow the set itself**, but after seeing these designs we feel we will create a much better product and look forward to showing it off.

http://i.imgur.com/QY9rAR9.jpg

&nbsp;

Truth is I'm quite busy, when we will fully update is unclear but its my favorite project I've ever done, and my baby essentially. Whenever valve has given feedback on something - it has immensely improved it, I felt the WD feedback was a bit harsh as I can't ignore some items that make it into the game, but we will be delivering you a better product, and thats whats important.

&nbsp;


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&nbsp;

Bit off topic but would like peoples opinions on these 2 sets. 

This whole scenario has been a huge confidence hit and has put me on tilt, everytime I make a item I question the vague feedback that was given "Repetitive elements? This BB set is full of spikes and rock shells, is that repetitive and bad?" 

&nbsp;


**Ember spirit**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This has been done for a while and is just sitting on my harddrive, no idea what to do with it, we don't want to upload without the ribbon FX as it just looks too  damn good, source2 is coming and valve specifically asked for no FX till then (in CNY blog).

I love this set, he looks like a beast but you can't ignore the fact that its literally made of 3 elements, if the WD feedback I got should be considered on other things, it's a failure.

The nightmare of designing fan hoodies.|self.DotA2|~Hi Reddit!

Some of you may know me. I'm a big fan of LoL, but for the last few years, I've been a bigger fan of DoTA 2.

A few years ago, back when I was playing both games roughly equal amounts, I saw an amazing artist design a number of hoodies for a game called Mass Effect. [Take a look at them here](http://lupodirosso.deviantart.com/art/mass-effect-hoodies-Tali-and-Garrus-294739828)

I was inspired. I took it upon myself to design a set of hoodies for LoL and DotA 2 shortly after.

[View the DotA2 hoodies here.](http://sitaduncan.weebly.com/dota-2-hoodies.html)

Not long after designing the LoL hoodies, I was contacted by Riot themselves. They loved my hoodies, and even wanted to put them into production! I sold a few of the designs, and sure enough, only a few months later...

[Blitzcrank Hoodie](http://www.jinx.com/p/league_of_legends_blitzcrank_champion_zip_up_hoodie.html)

[Malzahar Hoodie](http://www.jinx.com/p/league_of_legends_malzahar_zip_up_hoodie.html)

To say it was exciting is an understatement. I submitted other designs to Riot, hoping they would pick them up. Nothing ever came of it, but it was cool to see people so excited over something I had designed.

I also submitted my DoTA 2 designs to Valve, hoping they might like my hoodies, and perhaps even produce them. Nothing ever came of contacting them either, which was a disappointment, but I moved on.

I was the only one who appeared to move on from my hoodies however. My inbox became a daily slog of going through requests for my hoodies, everything from begging for free hoodies, to offering egregious sums for some of the hoodies that I had never actually produced. I'm not exactly a seamstress, so I couldn't actually make them myself, so I had to turn people down a lot. All of the time to be exact.

Pretty soon however, I started to be contacted by companies. Never big name companies, usually sketchy sounding companies located in regions with very little copyright law who wanted to manufacture my hoodies. As I had access to the designs, but not the rights to either set, I had to tell them no.

I was often very unprofessionally told that they didn't appreciate my refusal to offer them the full designs. I wish I could say that was the limit of the abuse.

I began receiving messages on my facebook artist page, email, seemingly everywhere about how horrible of a person I was for not making these hoodies available. I feel worse for these people's lack of understanding of reality than for the abusive words they sent to me.

I wish I could say it got better.

What I had to deal next with was something far more troublesome. People began to illegally produce my designs. I refuse to provide these links, but if you do a little googling, you can find several hoodies produced with my unreleased designs. I submitted these to Valve's legal department, and also went through the effort of submitting removal requests myself.

You can also find other artists claiming to be the artists behind my hoodies. 

But there's good news everyone! (The slime pipes are working again?)

I am finally getting a chance to produce the hoodies for which I have been so doggedly harassed and begged for.

You can finally vote for them on my steam page here:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=247667849&searchtext=

As you can see however, it didn't take long for someone to submit a DMCA request on me. Thus continues the cycle. Thanks for listening to my story, and please vote! If only so that you can make my life a little bit easier by letting people get my hoodies legally.


TLDR:  My hoodies may actually have a chance to be legitimately and legally created.  Please support the real hoodie and report any thefts that you find.

Edit: If you like Sproinking check out my Enchantress T-shirt, too! http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=247655709

Update 4/13: I am totally floored by the amount of support that I have received from friends and strangers alike these past 24 hours while dealing with the art theft.  You guys make me feel truly awesome! Thank you all so much.  Jugger hoodie is now incredibly highly rated in the contest and I'm daring to believe it will be produced! As a side note, you maaay be seeing some more hoodie designs, and even a few prototypes from me in the near future.

Update 4/15: The DMCA has been removed from my entry, and the prime art thief's entry has been banned!

7/5: No such luck with the hoodies, but thank you all for your support, and enjoy the International!

Just submitted our Gyrocopter set for Chinese New Year with custom ability particles! What do you think?|self.DotA2|~We've just submitted our Gyrocopter set that we've been working on for a couple of weeks called Gyrotechnics. To set our set apart from the others being submitted we've done custom particles for all 4 of Gyro's abilities and a particle for his death animation. All of the effects are based around Fireworks, a staple in Chinese New Year celebrations. 

I don't believe Valve has ever added custom particles submitted by community contributors before but we felt it really enhanced the set so we're hoping they're open to adding them in if the set does well.

For anyone who's worrying about the Flak Cannon particle being confused with Desolator, we're suggesting that it's only active when Flak Cannon is active and it'd be on every projectile Flak Cannon fires out. Desolator is only active on the main projectile when Flak Cannon is active.

Quiet from MGSV is coming to Dota 2|twitter.com||workshop
Dota IMBA has reached 1.5 million subscribers. A big, heartfelt thank you to all of you!|self.DotA2|~Hey, r/dota2! Been some time!

Some of you may know [Dota IMBA](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=440115357), one of the custom games you can play in the new Reborn client.

Not too long ago, IMBA was simply [a bunch of edits](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2rx4fq/presenting_dota_2_imba_a_custom_game_mod_where/) to the game's files, making abilities bigger, faster, cheaper, etc... And today, it's a full-fledged custom game, with 27 modified heroes, 35 customized items, and a bunch of options you can set up to customize your game. But more importantly: played by *so many people*!

I am truly aghast, day after day, by the amount of support this community delivers. The growth in playerbase has been immense - in fact, player count has been rising so fast that I wanted to make this post when we hit 1 million subscribers, but wasn't fast enough with the updates to do so.

Thank you. Thank you for being so supportive, for enjoying something that I poured a little part of my soul into, and for helping make it grow bigger and better. There's still a **lot** of stuff ahead of us before I can call IMBA a finished product, but you guys are the ones keeping me consistently motivated to do it.

Thank you players, thank you people who frequent the /r/dotaimba subreddit and prevent my stupid design decisions from ruining the game, thank you youtubers, thank you reviewers, thank you Valve, (especially /u/DanielJ_Valve), thank you experienced people from #dota2mods and [ModDota](http://moddota.com/forums/) who are always ready to help, thank you /u/Hewdraw for the help, thank you Mimiya for the inspiration and hours of fun. Thank you all!

Keep playing, and have fun! :)

---

If you have never played IMBA, and are wondering what the hell I'm talking about, think of it like this: "What would happen if Icefrog buffed every single hero in the game for 100 patches straight?"

[Check it out for yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfV2x5Rqsxo) with this video, made by  , which shows how a typical 10v10 match of IMBA pans out!

Here's [some](http://gfycat.com/ThickSlimyJumpingbean) of [the](http://i.imgur.com/38RaCDS.jpg) stuff you'll [see](http://i.imgur.com/bZv3POV.jpg) while [playing](http://gfycat.com/WellgroomedFickleBanteng).

You can read more about this custom game [on its workshop page](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=440115357), or get to know the changes done to each hero on our [quick hero changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/dotaimba/wiki/quick_hero_changelog).

I hope we keep enjoying this game, and many others, for a long time! Best regards!~|workshop

Valve we need word on what happens now that the custom game contest deadline has passed. Are we allowed to continue updating the game? And where do we show the % shares?|self.DotA2|~Contest is over. 

It is still possible to update the games. Some creators already have, others are afraid to because they worry it might disqualify them. Because of the short deadline many games had to be rushed out and are experiencing some bugs. Are we allowed to fix those or not?

It's important that we know. This contest shouldn't be decided by a game of chicken. If the games are going to be judged in the state they were in when the deadline passed and updating disqualifies you then there are already quite a few modes that have disqualified themselves without knowing. If that's not how it works and you are allowed to continue working, then it's not fair towards the people that aren't updating out of fear of disqualification even though the games might benefit from it. This is especially bad because some people are already updating and others want to but don't want to risk it.

A simple yes or no would suffice. We aren't asking for a lot of information here. 

On that note: In the rules you state: "2.	Identify all contributors to the submission and receive their confirmation, including percentage shares for the prize."

This functionality doesn't exist. Nobody knows where to add in the percentage shares for the members of their team. The functionality for that simply doesn't exist. We posted it in the workshop page but is that the right place? No idea. Not every team has an even split and it's important that we can communicate that. Especially since you specifically ask for it on the page.~|workshop

Announcing the Open Angel Arena Anniversary Tournament, a custom game tournament with a $10,000+ Prize Pool!|self.DotA2|~## The Open Angel Arena team is proud to announce the Open Angel Arena Anniversary Tournament, a custom game tournament with a $10,000+ Prize Pool.

Yes, you read that right. Last weekend we had a fundraiser for our tournament and we were hoping to raise $500. **We ended up with $10,349! 100% of that money is going towards the tournaments prize pool.**

* The tournament will take place on the 3rd and 4th of March, starting at 3pm Berlin Time both days.
* We currently plan on hosting the tournament for 32 teams. Should enough teams sign up then we might expand the tournament to a 64 team bracket. 
* [Link to the rules!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YJj_oRRLvmC6zvKQxBmg4yDZVesrJOqjJokESea2tIM/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Link to the sign up!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOVXbT1gyXzOEQDL2sEFQ1mD_sz08Y9NmRnMVziN7FTNBjZQ/viewform) Sign ups close Feb. 10th.
* The prize pool will be split as follows: First place: 50%; Second place: 25%; Third places: 12.5%

Join the [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/9ApbMyW) to find a team for the tournament and to play games with the best players!

#### Where do I watch?

The tournament will be streamed on my [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/l34Um1) but we'll make another announcement the day of the tournament.

We are also happy to have other streamers cast tournament matches or have players stream their games. Feel free to contact us if we can be of assistance.

## What is Open Angel Arena?

* [Trailer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jaGleeqKvw)
* [How to play!](https://youtu.be/BXsSy65mSnk) (5 minutes)
* [How to play and design discussion!](https://youtu.be/hI7seVtUeZo) (52 minutes)
* [Workshop Page!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=513926896)
* [Video of a competitive game of OAA](https://youtu.be/-Nu8FXF9DGg)

Open Angel Arena is a modern reimagining of the classic Angel Arena game mode. It was made by a group of passionate Angel Arena players that grew unhappy with the current iterations on the workshop. So we took it into our own hands to remake the game from scratch, revisiting old features while modernizing and streamlining the gameplay. It is a highly competitive game and there is a lot to learn. If you plan on joining the tournament I recommend you start practicing soon.

* **Most heroes are viable**, including supports, casters and tanks. In fact, supports are absolutely essential to many strategies.
* **All items are upgradeable**. This allows for a wide range of possible item builds and for an even wider range of possible strategies. Have you ever wanted to play attack damage Elder Titan using the 100% lifesteal talent or use Lunas ultimate to rain death and stuns on an entire team? In Open Angel Arena these strategies are not only possible but actually viable. 
* **New custom items**, designed by the community and carefully balanced before being added.
* **Bosses have been redesigned to be an integral part of the game and have been made more interesting**. To upgrade items you have to kill bosses, often as early as 10 minutes into the game and then regularly for the rest of the match. A killed boss respawns as a new, stronger boss with new abilities. Bosses in OAA have various mechanics that you will have to deal with while battling them and arent simple DPS tanks.
* **Duels have been redesigned to include objectives that encourage players to fight and enable objective based gameplay**. There are multiple different duel arenas that you can be placed into and you will always be playing in a duel. If there is a 1v1 in one arena there is also a 4v4 in a different one and so on.
* To win the game you must win a Final Duel. **The first team to 100 points will trigger a Final Duel. The team with 100 points then needs to win this Final Duel to win the game**. If they dont then the games score limit gets extended by 10, putting it into overtime. This goes on until a team wins a Final Duel.
* Fountain camping has been eliminated from the game.
* [Our custom music is amazing!](https://soundcloud.com/user-238514931)

Open Angel Arena is an open source project. There's lots of cool stuff we have designed, if you'd like to help create them, check out [our GitHub](https://github.com/OpenAngelArena/oaa). We are always looking for new people to help with the game. Its a fun experience and if you are a new developer the best experience you can get is to simply work on a game. If you work on Open Angel Arena you can also get feedback on your work by professional developers. You can find the developer discord in the installation instructions on GitHub.

We look forward to having you play in the Open Angel Arena Anniversary Tournament and even if you don't play we hope you enjoy watching it!

### What's happening until then?

* We are still working on the game and a few small features will be added before the tournament. The balance of the game will also be adjusted mildly. But these changes will be made a reasonable time ahead of the tournament so you have at least a few weeks to practice.
* We will soon release our [first custom hero](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19A8S42MtunAp7q9YHn7u3drwlc26rzyDO6iRoI0p5YY/). This hero will not be allowed in the tournament, so don't worry about that. But if you feel like giving some feedback on the guy that would be great and very helpful.
* In all likelihood we are going to be hosting a second fundraiser soon. This time not all money will go to the prize pool but instead we want to use some of the donations to help push the development of the game by using it for bug bounties and administrative fees like running the website. Donations from this second fundraiser will receive ingame rewards through our upcoming free Bottlepass. The fundraiser will be held on my [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/l34Um1).
* We have our version of a Battlepass, the Bottlepass, releasing soon. This will include MMR and unlockable cosmetics, some custom made.

### We hope you'll give our game a shot. Lots of great and passionate people have worked hard to make it a truly fun and competitive experience!

7.07 and the Frostivus Custom Game Contest|self.DotA2|~Hey, 
I am one of the developers working on a game for the [Frostivus Custom Game Contest](http://blog.dota2.com/2017/09/frostivus-custom-game-contest/). I'll keep this short and to the point, if you have any more questions I'll gladly answer them. 

There are 2 weeks left until the deadline. 7.07 released a week ago, 3 weeks before the deadline.

Creating a well made game in little over 2 months is an insane task, almost impossible on it's own. The recent patch broke many essential parts of the game, essentially invalidating a ton of work that has been done on the contest entries. An example of this is the change to "RespawnHero" which is used to modify the respawn times of heroes, something that almost every existing custom game uses. 

The people participating in this contest are largely already active members of the Dota 2 modding community. We have existing custom games, many of which were ruined by 7.07. This puts us into a situation where we have to choose between fixing our already existing games or continuing work on our Frostivus entries. Abandoning our current games for up to 3 weeks basically means letting them die completely since the player base will be long gone by then.

I have a question and depending on the answer a request:

While the deadline for the custom game contest is the 20th, does that mean that the development for the game needs to stop at that point in time? Are games judged on their state on the 20th? Or are we still allowed to continue updating and patching? The phrasing in the rules is not clear here, as it only says that the submission needs to be finished by the 20th.

If yes, then that's great. An extension of the deadline would still be fantastic but this is already a good start.

If no, then an extension of the deadline would be appreciated. Give us another week to allow us to fix the damage 7.07 did, not only to our Frostivus entries but to the entire Arcade.~|workshop

Sneak peek of Dota IMBA's upcoming 7.00 update|self.DotA2|~Hello, r/dota2!

Dota IMBA has gone without updates for a somewhat long time now (months!), because we have been preparing a BIG update to bring the game up to par with Dota 7.00. The current version is a patchwork solution that *works*, i.e. doesn't crash and is playable, at least, but we feel it didn't adapt well to Dota's 7.00 paradigm change at all.

One of the things we made to actually make the game *close to 7.00*, instead of just a 6.88 clone with talents duct-taped in, was our own take on the talents system. [Here is how it works:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OJ5DgVC_YU)

 - Heroes' maximum level is 40, by default. Normal abilities have 7 levels, while ultimates have 6 (learnable at 6, 12,18, 24, 30, 36).
 - Heroes can pick one of 6 *generic*, stat-only talents on levels 5, 15, 25, and 35.
 - The available *generic* talents change from hero to hero; for example, casters will usually have at least 1-2 options between CDR, spell lifesteal, cast range, or spell damage amplification.
 - Each *generic* talent can only be picked once; if you pick cast range at level 5, for example, you cannot pick it again at 15.
 - Finally, generic talents are stronger if picked later in the match; for example, picking a spell damage amplification talent at level 5 might grant you +10% damage, while waiting until 35 to make the same pick would give you +25% instead.

There are also *unique* talents. these are a binary choice - pick one out of two - that can be made at levels 10, 20, 30, 40. All of them change a hero's abilities in some way (sometimes pretty dramatic). For example, at level 40, Axe has the option of increasing his Culling Blade's kill threshold by a massive **400**, or to give it +650 cast range, allowing him to leap from far away to dunk fools.

Overall, we hope these additions can allow you to play the same hero multiple times without getting bored, due to the increased flexibility, and maybe even give vanilla dota some ideas, as has happened before.

For those who already play IMBA, worry not: we didn't spend all those motnhs just making a pretty little talent screen. We basically rewrote the game from the bottom up. All heroes have been at least slightly reworked from their current IMBA versions. You'll have a good time figuring out the new combos and crazy things that can be pulled off!

---

IMBA 7.00 is coming **soon** (tm). We expect a release sometime next week, if no unforeseen roadblocks present themselves.

/u/D2imba (Firetoad, previous IMBA developer), /u/shushishtok (Thunderlizard, current IMBA developer), and the entire development team wish you good luck, and have fun!~|workshop

This has its rating inflated, and legitimate voters need to know.

EmpireTV.HEAVEN is known to use bots to spoof submissions to the top.

Here is a screencap of a steam conversation between HEAVEN and a workshop contributor, in case you haven't seen it before. 

Credit goes to this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1vk0np/first_pick_7_danidem_reveals_upvote_botters/

Posts on the items themselves calling him out on this keep getting deleted, and the accounts flagged and banned for "spam."
This is important information that needs to be seen.

The usage of bots on the workshop needs to be addressed, HEAVEN is already trade banned for other scummy and scammy acts, but he needs to be removed from the workshop as well.

Nevermind my opinions on the set itself, these abhorrent practices need to stop, the workshop should be about what the community actually wants, not who pays whom for upvotes.~|complaint
Can we bring the attention of Valve to the Dota Hattery please?|self.DotA2|~We all know Valve reads Reddit way closer than the emails or the dev forum, so i just wanted to point out that the amazing http://dotahattery.com/ is nowhere near the service providers list (Service providers can get a percentage of sales out of Valve share, if the item gets in).

It's a service lots of both Dota players and Dota workshop artists use regularly and it keeps money and effort to keep it up updated and running. if we can make it appear on the service provider list it will not only be a boost to this actual service, but will incite other services to grow and maybe get on the list too.

Open Angel Arena has nothing to do with the bots spamming links and canceling custom game lobbies|self.DotA2|~Hey, project lead for Open Angel Arena here.

To keep it short:
The bots that have been joining and ruining custom games have started spamming "Check out this much better custom game https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=513926896 - https://savecustomgames.github.io/"

We have absolutely nothing to do with this and condemn it. This is not the way to go about it.

We have been getting a lot of aggressive comments on our workshop page and I understand your frustration but please keep in mind that this only hurts us as well. We don't want to be associated with this. It doesn't make sense for us to get publicity this way, especially since we're currently in the planning phase for a tournament in March. This is very frustrating for us and I just want you to know that we are very unhappy about this situation as well.~|workshop

Pure Reflex and some inside information!|self.DotA2|~Hi there, I noticed a lot of people have come across Pure Reflex, popularity has grown and many pro players are testing out their reactions. With the communities help Pure Reflex has risen to a top 20 game and has very positive ratings, 73,646 (80% of total) which is huge in the Dota 2 community.

Just thought Id let the community know what my opinions are in the current state of custom games. I know Im not that known around here but I thought Id just give my two cents. Ill also be updating with more updates/opinions closer to spring so be sure to give my Twitter a check.

Anyway, as eSports are growing, I feel there is a need for games where players can grow, challenge and express themselves. I feel Pure Reflex is great for this. All players start on an equal footing, there is no randomness, conditions are the same for everyone and the outcome is decided by Pure skill ad reaction which is extremely important in eSports.

It is now my opinion that it would be best to create a standalone game and publish it on steam. I have a lot of experience in developing games now and am currently working at Gameloft. I have also received a lot of job offers from companies in Europe and participated in the development of a few games that have been released. Here are a few mods Ive created for Dota 2 specifically over 3 years.

http://steamcommunity.com/id/mocherad/myworkshopfiles/

Unfortunately though there has not been any support from the Valve/Dota 2 team in all this time. There are a lot of unfixable issues in modding currenly, for example implementing an MMR system is impossible. We also have no way to deal with leaves. I dont hate Valve for this, I actually plan on working at Valve sometime and if not Valve hopefully Blizzard! Id also like to say Valve actually has very good devs, for example, the CS: GO Valve team is very good. They helped a lot with the level design competition with CS: GO. However the Dota 2 team seems to have a lot of problems, not sure why either. I feel like the community has lost a couple of years progress with custom games which is a shame as we have lost a lot of the custom games player base of the years. I feel like I could be a big help to Valve in this situation.

Due to these reasons, I plan on creating a standalone game of Pure Reflex and upload it on steam. I plan on adding everything I had wished to add to my custom game on Dota 2 but was not able to.

A rating system, a. Players have always given feedback that they cannot find players of similar skill. This is both a problem for new players and veterans.
Tournament system a. Organisations should be able to easily make a tournament (it will take few minutes 5-10 to create)
Different game modes a. FFA, deathmatch etc
Replay system
AI bots to practice on your own

At the moment I am planning the roadmap for my game. I am doing a GDD, interviewing future employees (3D, 2D artists, programmers, and animators) I also have a well-known studio in Asia that is interested.

As for Dota 2 mods! Dont worry I wont stop creating the community! For more details and official announcements please follow my personal twitter where I will post all the info. Also, I am looking for beta testers, if you are interested, let me know!

The first ORPG addon (v 0.55)|self.DotA2|~HeyGuys.
I'm glad to present to you my **ORPG** (online role-playing game) addon.
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=562659280

This addon is going to consist of several maps, which you will be able to play depending on your hero's level. It's inspired by lots of MMORPGs, but will also try to have it's own zest.

**It has working:**

- 1 map designed for 1-10 leveling (aiming to have 45 or 60 level cap);

- **Save and load system!;**

- **Hero to hero trading!;**

- **Custom inventory;**

- **Crafting system;**

- Custom items (equipment, usables and loot);

- Enchanting;

- Custom quests tabs;

- 3 fully done heroes;

- 10 levels of creeps with custom aggro system and wandering function;

- 1 party boss (accessible through a quest);

- 7 quests;

Works best with 16:9 screen ratio (for now).

Data wipe is going to take place somewhere at beta. 


**What it aims for:**

- To have **endless gameplay** and be **infinitely replayable**;

- To have passion inducing atmosphere - to **be farmed**, **get epic loot** and **fight with other players** in arenas or dungeons;

- To force players to **team up** to get the said epic loot;

- To have interesting lore and a storyline;

- To be a little mmorpg inside the DOTA 2 with servers up to 20 people;


**Screenshots:** http://imgur.com/a/swWcF

It's still a **WIP** and lacks a lot of content, but bear with me - i'm working on it solo and try to make it perfect, at least as i see it, as much as i can.

Follow my twitch channel to be aware of any upcoming streams, support the project and help to change and balance the map in chat discussions. http://www.twitch.tv/ambassador601

I, think enough time has passed and enough changes were made since i posted this on reddit for the first time.~|workshop

I am a custom game creator and i cant even join my own game anymore|self.DotA2|~Hi everyone,

Today my friends and I tried to play our custom game, [Battleships](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=302491959), which we have been continually building and balancing for the last three years. Unfortunately, we discovered that there seems to be an unannounced level-based restriction on playing custom games that prevents nearly all of us from joining a lobby.

We dont really play DOTA2 proper, which means were all low level, but have spent a lot of time improving and debugging a game that now has ~~200,000 subs and ~~150 weekly players. Its a great way for us to stay in touch as our lives move us around, and hopefully provide a fun game for the community :).

Does anyone know the details of this restriction or how long it might be in place? It appears that this is a response to a problem with bot spam, its just frustrating to spend so much time making and playing a game only to have it taken away with no information, alternatives, or timelines.
Thanks!


tl;dr We cant play our custom game and would like to be able to.~|workshop

Hey R/Dota2, after listening to your great critiques we are finally ready to release our courier, SQUIRE SNORTS THE OMNIPUG! Take a look!|self.DotA2|~[SQUIRE SNORTS LORE: Now in Video Form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95lR10Q2mts) by edje! 

[Steam Workshop Link!](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=479158872)



Hey guys! 

A few months ago we came to you with our beloved pug courier project. Me and Vlad both have pugs and have always wanted one in game, so this is our attempt to add some snorts into Dota 2. As such, its been a passion project for both of us and we are really pumped to launch him today!

***Whats New?***

Our biggest critiques last time were: 

1. The wierd looking refresher orb: this has been replaced with a new little pouch to hold your tangos and mangos and a little clarity. [here is his new model](http://gfycat.com/GleamingExemplaryInsect) 

2. Not enough animations and a static face: we have added several new animations and more life into the face (blinking and moving tongue) [animation showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg8e-5d3B_w)

3. Only 1 pug color: We have added Dire Black pug! 

Overall we are both really happy with the way he turned out! Thank you so much for being a part of it with us.

***Whats next?***

Well, you can vote for the pug to see it in game or you can leave us a comment here about any improvements you might want to see or critiques. Last time you guys had great feedback and while we might think we have everything we could want this time you might have more suggestions. Overall we think Squire Snorts would make a great addition, and we hope you do too!

Thanks for reading and see you in the trench!

Steam Workshop : Razor Set|self.DotA2|~Hi all!

I just made an item set for Razor: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=171879486

YouTube video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAPkgWO7q6I&feature=youtu.be

This set has actually been sitting around on my hard drive for quite some time.  I had a really hard time with the design, so I kept shelving and re-designing it.  Hope you all like it :)

Amber Broodmother set: A plea to change the eyes|self.DotA2|~The new set is fantastic and looks really good except for the eyes.


I know they are the base model but others e.g. Zipfinator did a similar thing with his [Skywrath Mage set Blessing of the Crested Dawn](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Blessing_of_the_Crested_Dawn) ([head piece shot](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/6/69/Cosmetic_icon_Virtue_of_the_Crested_Dawn.png?version=873628d28cc53c4f93fbd21ad32dd755)) and [Vengeful Spirit set Umbral Virtue](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Umbral_Virtue) ([head piece shot](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/9/98/Cosmetic_icon_Umbral_Virtue.png?version=6903fbb92e0a0fdb762fa33a1196b96b)). I believe it's done by placing a texture over the eyes but I may be wrong. The whole Amber Queen set is fantastic but I think the eyes, in this case, look very out of place.

I'm hoping to reach out to the maker of this set to ask whether it's possible. 

[How it looks like now](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/577947268917925025/D112B989C4835747A9B0FE2974F61358B9C6D509/)

It is done! The remake of the original eul map is LIVE!|self.DotA2|~Under my different username (itworks 1234, I changed it to align it with my steam one) I have promised the remake of the very first Dota versions:

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4sqr64/the_promised_remake_of_the_original_eul_wc3_dota/

Well, it is done! It's called Dota Classic and here's the Steam Workshop page:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725837387

Search on the in-game arcade for "Dota Classic"

It has some bugs - it's the very first beta after all and I've only tested it against AI so far, but all the orginal mechanics are there:

* All items fully shareable
* Killing a barracks stops the respective production
* Secret river shop
* Morbazan (secret quest)
* Special items tied to scourge/sentinel

All original heroes ported, with the exception of four (they will get ported too, just a bit later). Sniper's ulti is different than in the original,will be changed later. Leshrac needs some modifications as well.

All items (except one: infravision dog, coming soon), all spells and the old layout! The xp/gold mechanics however are not a perfect replica of the original for now. That's coming in a later version.

I will monitor this thread for feedback, and I hope I get lots of it.

Please be aware that it's not going to be 100% replica in all areas, that's simply impossible given the engine differences.

EDIT: I played with a few people and there were some stability bugs (I've never tested it with others before) Please bear with me, I will fix the issues. Please report disconnects.

EDIT: Leveling seems to be fixed now. I needed around ten minutes to reach level six against AI, that's the same as in the original. Killing heroes might give still too much xp however.~|workshop
