Disable reporting during the game|self.DotA2|~In light of new changes to reporting system, I suggest another change: Disable the report option on the scoreboard while match is going on. If someone still wants you to report after the game ends, he has the ability to do so.  People get often reported when they make a mistake during the game or make someone rage accidentally . Personally I have to admit I report people sometimes who trigger me whom I wouldnt report at the end of the game

Do you think this change would improve the reporting system?

Dota is a Game with more than 10,000,000 Players worldwide, can it please finally get a fixed Staff to ensure all it's Features are getting maintained?|self.DotA2|~It feels like most features of this game are broken and have been abandoned. Tutorials, Bots, Custom Games, Effigies, Gems, Weather, Loading Screens are useless and hell, there are even Team Pennants from fu**ing TI2 that were never updated and the reason for all of this is Valves Firm Policy that allows everyone to change the projects they are working on whenever they want. Basically, if the Developers that worked on the Custom Game Editor want to work on something else inside the company, they are free to do so and it will never get updated again unless someone else does the work.

Why is "Scan" still called "Scan" and looks like something out of Call of Duty? We should have something more LORE FRIENDLY|self.DotA2|~Yes, scan actually does "scan" an area, but i dont get how it fits into the universe. Its a legit radar icon and makes pinging noises, like there is a UAV flying overhead and if I get 10 kills i should be able to call in a AC130

I would suggest we call it something like "eyes of the ancient" and have the icon be an observer ward like eye. When activated instead of a radar animation it could be a outline of a eye frantically looking in every direction, but if sees something it turns red and the eye opens wide, alert. https://imgur.com/a/1Q1Vv

Lore wise it would make sense too, as if to suggest that the ancient itself is mustering power to look at a specific place on the map to aid it's brainwashed heroes in their battle, but much like re-spawns it takes time for the ancient to recharge its power.

Valve, it's time for some much needed features and community reform.|self.DotA2|~I've never been good at introductions but I think it's time we see some real changes to help Dota grow. Valve has shown that it wants to start promoting the game and adding features to help attract and hook new players which is really great, but what really prompted me to make this thread is the sudden increase in the number of threads regarding toxicity in games and the community in general. Dota's player base has also been quite stagnant for years now and the top reasons new players quit, is due to experiencing smurfing and toxicity in games, this is further worsened by a insufficient tutorial which doesn't provide the necessary tools for newbs to succeed.  This thread is solely to address issues within the community that I and many others have experienced. Here are my ideas to help remedy this and make Dota a more pleasant experience in all of this. Please note that these changes do not aim to remove in game systems, but are additions or expansions to existing ones. (The exception to this is in regards to the arcade)

#REWARD GOOD BEHAVIOUR
The first step is promote good behaviour and reward players for being friendly and teaching to others. It's been proven that positive reinforcement can do wonders and can really improve a person's attitude and performance, so if there were a system implemented that allowed players to be rewarded for being good people, this would greatly improve the overall atmosphere in game. First off, **commending needs to be encouraged more often**, it's not uncommon that we simply forget to commend someone with found enjoyable or friendly in a match, but we almost never forget to report a annoying or unpleasant player.. A good method is to have a screen at the end of a match, that's dedicated to commending which would be seen before the regular score screen. For rewards, they can range from** actual rewards** such as a chest, an exclusive item, special terrain skin or a set, which the chance of receiving would justify for many players the extra effort it can be to be more forgiving and understanding. The next method and what I believe to be the most important/effective is to give players that have been exceedingly good something to show off. Why? Because **Dota player's love to brag** and what better way to promote good behaviour than to grant a temporary badge of honour to make it real clear, who's **better than the rest of us**.

#MORE REASONS TO PLAY
Dota is a incredibly stressful and emotion game to play, but have you ever wondered why? It's because **winning is everything**. Everything about Dota creates the expectation that you should be trying to win every game that you play, so much so that even in the games that you have no control over, **you feel like a loser** and it's because you have failed every win condition in or outside the game. What I'd propose is a way to soften the blow of losing and to add more ways to "win" at Dota. Loot creates, set collecting, in game currency, farming commends, quests, achievements are all common themes in other multiplayer games and can create a much more casual experience for those who aren't interested in tri-harding, spamming ranked and gaining MMR. Make it so, even if you lose, you still gain something, acknowledge the fact that **Dota is an incredibly emotional game** and do something about it. Now for the big one and this will lead into my next idea, add more ways to "win". **Tournaments, In-House leagues, guilds, clans and the arcade**. Having more player goals to work towards is real important to decreasing stress and frustration after a loss because it gives other reasons and goals to work toward which aren't completely defeated when losing a match.

#REDUCE ANONYMITY, INCREASE COMMUNITY AND BELONGING
The current Dota promotes to much individualism, solo queue being the only MMR that matters and there being almost no way to interact with your fellow players, creates even more anonymity compared to a standard internet community and is further promoted by the ability to change your name any time and to anything. By giving people a concrete community to belong to, you can reduce the amount players act as if nothing matters, by allowing them to develop their own reputations and friends amongst community groups. My suggestion to implement guilds, clans and groups, but before I go into this topic, I'd also like to explain why guilds and clans failed in Source 1 and it's because there was no reason to create one, there was no way to interact directly with clan/guild mates and there was nothing to give clan/guild members a sense of belonging. Here's how to make it work in various stages:

* First idea is to give **tournament organisers and broadcast studios the ability to create tournament pages and groups**, so that people can subscribe them, promoting this and implementing into the client is very important. This allows the tournament organiser/studio to **notify their members** on steam, on your phone, on your twitch, when a match they are hosting has started, allows members to chat with each other, before, during and after a game. Also this give tournaments and studios a means to directly communicate with their audiences. **Allow these groups to moderate themselves**, this is very important because Valve I know how you hate interacting with the community.

* Secondly, give **Teams the ability to create their own** pages and groups, for the same reasons. Allow them to promote themselves, do giveaways, notify their fans of upcoming games and host a place of discussion before, during and after a game. Give an option to merge chat channels, so that tournament organisers, studios and teams and interact together. 

* Next is to allow users to form their own groups. This will be mainly for people who have a big following to have their own dota following, people such as AdmiralBulldog, Purge, Day[9], GrandGrant, BurNing, Dendi a place for their fan base to talk with each other and be notified when they're streaming, playing, if they've join a new team, uploaded a new video. Also allow them to moderate themselves.

* **In-house Leagues** come now, allow every group to host their own In-house League, many of you have seen how **successful FPL** was/is and I'm sure the top players enjoyed it immensely. Anonymity is both the greatest strength and weakness of the internet, it not only allow you to escape, but also allows people to incredibly toxic to others because they have their true identities hidden. This solves 2 problems, playing with randoms you don't know and have no connection with and top level players being queued for unreasonable amounts of time. I suggest groups that host in-house games have rules that their users either have to use their pro names or not be able to change their name after joining or even have it shown in brackets next their current name.

* Teams/Squads and **Regular Tournaments with no pay wall**. This is for players that want to play the more competitive side of dota, have the ability to create teams that are not qualified to enter minors or majors, but can enter weekly tournaments for small prizes or just tournament wins and profile borders/stats. This **separate to Battle Cup**, where it's seasonal, requires a ticket and also provides better rewards. Have groups also be able to host their own tournaments, either in themselves or against other groups, this is to spark community interaction and rivalry amongst bigger groups. **Teams should have results, prizes and ranks tied to the team** to discourage players from endless creating useless teams.

* Last suggestion is for **Arcade/Community Workshop groups.** Groups that are dedicated to a arcade game or a workshop developer, give these guys a way of building their own followings, like they did in Warcraft 3. Have groups especially for workshop development and tutorials. This will also require a rework of the current arcade, it's a disaster, you can't even play as a party without each individual person finding the game and downloading it, like at least give each player in the party a prompt to download it.

To reiterate the important points allow users the ability to **create groups inside the Dota client**, so that they they can **receive notifications** about matches, streams new videos etc. Allow for the **creation and hosting of in house leagues** inside the client so that players can play games with a group of people they are more familiar with. **Host Regular tournaments** to provide for players looking for a more competitive experience. Allow these **communities to customise and moderate themselves**, set their own rules and requirements for joining, private of public. This will not only decrease the workload on your end Valve, but allow these groups to be more personal and niche. **Promote and support these features to come, community and a sense of belonging are what keeps players here even if the game doesn't.** 

#THE ARCADE
This could be Dota's strongest feature, very few games have good mod support and Valve you may just find your next winner from this. Starcraft and Warcraft were all wildly successful thanks to their great mod support, and 3 of your most popular games were previously mods, I think it's time to pay some respect to this portion of Dota 2. From the player perspective the arcade and custom game section has always been a part of the game to unwind and find something new, to relieve some of the tension from regular Dota, even Starcraft 2's arcade which was considered a disaster is still a popular place players go to for some time to kill. The arcade unlimited potential and can also be used to help new players to Dota, user submitted tutorials or using custom maps as a means to get used to basic mechanics and controls. The biggest problems of the arcade right now are that: 

* **It doesn't work** The lobby doesn't allow you to kick players that are afk, select colour, position, race, role, you can't play a new game as a party without having each party member finding the game and individually downloading it and every game bar the top 10 - 20 are dead. In Warcraft 3, there was no list of popular games, there was only open lobby and the list of games was only sorted by genre and came from sites like epicwar and hiveworkshop (which also had most popular, but was defaulted as what's new).

* **It's hidden**, currently the arcade is hidden away behind a tab. A unsorted list of open lobbies (for your region/ping) should just appear on the front page as a panel and if you wish to browse or host your own game you can go to the arcade tab. In my opinion, the list should only include minimal information such as thumbnail, game name, game type and host name, but do not include number of players to allow lobbies to fill up more evenly and naturally. This is to promote and keep the idea of the arcade in everyone's mind and make it feel like the arcade is as important as the main game.

* **Provided resources for developers** I just feel as if the number of doodads, props and tile sets Valve provides to workshop artists is very little and makes making games much to timely. In Warcraft 3, many of the best games and classics used the default models and tile sets provided by the game itself and it was only after many years that games with many custom models and tile sets appeared, but only after there were a huge variety of games to play, many of which were modified melee maps. Edit: This may be of an issue of the editor being too difficult to use rather than a lack of provided materials. In which case an easier more user friendly should be developed, similar to the wc3 editor.

* **Unit Control** Valve just copy like Starcraft or Warcraft for this part, the current HUD and Unit control systems just don't allow for good unit control, meaning games which only allow you to use one character are the only things worth even considering.

* **The arcade should be part of the tutorial**. Using custom maps to allow players get used to different game play mechanics, such as cast times, turn rates, fog of war. Adding challenge and verse modes for each of the scenarios would be such a fun way to learn Dota. Most importantly, these mini games should point to the arcade as a means to find alternative versions or other fun mini games.

#PROS HAVE TO BE MADE ACCOUNTABLE
**Pros represent the game and the community**, so anything they do that promotes shitty and toxic behaviour has to be punishable. I'm **NOT** talking about the occasional and rare instances of toxicity caused by shitty moods or accidents, but rather **extreme and regular instances** of flaming, abandoning, intentional feeding, doxxing, stream sniping, raiding is **NOT OK**. The outside world is peering into your home, at least pretend to have it be clean and inviting. Note: When talking about pros, I'm talking streamers, tournament attendees, Youtubers, studios, casters, anyone and everyone who has a larger than normal public image. 

Edit: This was not my strongest point, you guys have made it quite clear. I'm not asking pro's to become community role models, but I do still believe that Valve should at least be a little more strict toward these individuals. This is probably most popular topic of discussion as it's the only one that people have actually replied for both sides, rather than disliking it for the sake of it.

#A WALL FOR SMURFS
The current barrier for entry is incredibly low, which is seemingly great for new players, but is ruined due to rampant smurfing. It's important to decide **which features of Dota, new players can make use of**. New players should be at least required to play multiple ~~~~bot~~~~ co-op vs ai games **on and against** a **limited hero pool** before versing **players of their level**, told about hotkeys and basics of RTS, such as multiple unit control. **Having all the heroes at your disposal is great for experienced player but is useless to new players** which should only be playing 1 or 2 heroes at the most, whilst they get a grasp of the game. A lesson from League of legends, which I know mentioning is taboo, but they have a much less rampant smurfing at the really low level because there is such a large wall between starting from scratch and having all the features unlocked, that most experienced players would rather pay for level 30 accounts instead of levelling a new ones from scratch. I don't have any concrete suggestions for this part, but I highly recommend baring the most prominent but most useless features of Dota 2 for new accounts to reduce smurfing.

> To clarify, the main idea is to identify the main aspects of dota which are considered core. Identify which of these are unimportant to players that are just starting or learning the game. And introducing these concepts slow enough that it becomes unappealing for experienced players to want to make an account and playing through this process which would otherwise go unnoticed by a truly new player. League does this by slowly unlocking summoner spells, giving talent points and unlocking runes over 30 levels which is like 100+ games. This process is considered progression by newer players and isn't annoying. Experienced players however, would rather not go through this process because it takes ages and isn't worth being able to Smurf. Although it doesn't remove everyone, it reduces the number of Smurfs enough that it isn't really noticed by new players and the majority of Smurfs lie at level 30 from bought accounts or play which is way beyond what a brand new player would encounter. Note how it doesn't remove Smurf from the game, just reduces the chance of a new player encountering one, which is the point.

#FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
This game lives off its player base, this game lives and dies with the players. I suggest creating a coaching program for new players, this program would **involve a experienced player with a good behaviour record to volunteer** and coach a new player 1 on 1 for their first 5 - 10 games. This is to help new players get a grasp on the game from someone who is experienced, yet also promotes positive attitude and condemns poor behaviour and sportsmanship. These **volunteers will of course be rewarded** for their time and if the player they **coached sticks around** for say 50 games. Rewards can be similar or even more exclusive than good behaviour rewards stated above and of course a nice badge for some bragging rights. Adding mini games and challenge scenarios for core mechanics may also be strong method of introducing Dota to players which are interested but feel they aren't ready for a real match. Valve has shown it isn't above using user submitted content as main selling points in games and using arcade features to expand the tutorial and join the arcade and Dota communities together is a win-win scenario.

#TO THE COMMUNITY
This is still up to you guys, you can really make this place much better and more welcoming. I know there a many of you that that have been around for ages and love this game. So keep do your part in condemning toxicity, but more importantly promote the creation art work and community interaction, good play, commend and add nice and kind people (a friend request goes a long way and is worth even more than a commend) and remember this a game, just try have fun.

#TO VALVE
You've recreated my favourite game of all time and have continued to support it and although I haven't agreed with every approach you took and I've wizened up to your increasing greed over the years, I'm still eternally thankful. You know full well, how important it is to grow the player base of a free game, just think of the millions you can make with the millions of new players that join. I just hope you make the right decisions whatever they may be and bring Dota and it's community to new heights.

Edit 1: Added clarification to The Wall for Smurfs Sections.

Edit 2: The majority of you guys agree that Pro's should not be made role models and should act and punished as if they are normal players.

Edit 3: Thanks for my first gold and reddit silver /s

Edit 4: I've read essentially every reply so far, but i gots to sleep. Remember --> **community** <-- use it solve our problems.

Edit 5: In the wall for Smurfs section, I do mean coop vs ai matches, not bot matches. A few of you are quite opposed to limiting the hero pool for new players, although my actual suggestions for this part aren't weren't meant to be concrete, I still think it would do less harm then good, but the main way of teaching newbs is through coaching and enhanced tutorial.~|suggest

UI is getting better and better, but we still miss these things.|self.DotA2|~* "Learn ability" hotkey option, I don't know why you would remove options we had for so long, when it's just a hotkey. (Alot of people are writing that you can ctrl-hotkey to level up. I know this but I hate to use the ctrl button, Ctrl-Q for example feels so awkward)
 
* Learn talent hotkey. One hotkey to bring up the talent tree, and then 2 more hotkeys, one for left talent skill and one for the right.

* (New suggestion from comments about how you could skill talents) rather said if it worked like the chat wheel and the screen was split down the middle and you hover left or right could be good

* Bring hp/mana bars above the skills, placing them at the very bottom of the screen is really annoying.

* Last hits, KDA to be shown at all times. I promise you, Dota 2 viewer count on twitch will decrease if this is not fixed. The players stream. It's really boring to watch a stream if you can't see their score, last hits etc. 

* Give a better XP bar, not one who is in a circle, also would be good to show the numbers without pressing alt.

* Option to turn of the new sound when something happens in the game, kills towers etc.

* Move the gold to be closer to the center of the screen, you can add the quickbuy things to the very bottom and put gold + courier usage above it. Let the gold be to the left, and courier to the right (now gold is to the right)

* Add hotkey to "take backpack items", just like we have for "take stash items"

* Buff/debuff icons.
Right now, they just sort of float around above the control console, and the UI breaks if there's more than 6 of them. They need to be left aligned, and tightly spaced together. (hamataro suggestion) - Also maybe put a timer inside the icon (like normal spells) or above the buff icons to see how long a buff/debuff has left, it would make things much more clearer. Rather than only having that circle "cooling off"

* Here is a suggestion for a better HUD (superm4nkumar suggestion): http://i.imgur.com/NgxtCx3.jpg

* The AVG mmr is still bugged to -1

* Range indicator is broken for some spells, like tinkers March of the Machine

* The Confirm button when you random doesn't work

* Let us have both the normal shop and the customized open at the same time, like we did before. Or atleast let us a prefered show that should be shown every game, now we always have to change if we want the normal shop in every game. -- A way to default to the shop and not the guide/recommended would be nice (better explained)

* Put a timer when the item is transfered from backpack to inventory, to see how long is left until we can use it

* ANOTHER BUG: "Minimap draw on right side" needs to be reselected every game now, in the configurations. Also, the UI is weirder with option now, considering the UI for Death info, runes, enemies info, etc.

* Also like to see damage and armour values changed back to (a) + (b) instead of just an overall value as it is now, without having to pres alt. Same goes for damage 

* Shop hotkeys are not working currently at all

*  Would maybe even suggest moving the scan/glyph to above the map, that way sponsor overlays and stuff can still fit.

* You have to scroll across again on the post-game scoreboard to see MMR change!

* Skill/Item tooltip should have a slightly longer delay as it will show up briefly when you edge pan downwards.

* health / mana bar background should be less saturated(black?) so you could see the length of the bar with your peripheral vision more easily.

* If you press your shop hotkey while being close to the laneshop or secret shop. Fix so only the items from that shop is available, rather than opening the normal shop and having the items that are available highlighted. 

* Still missing icons above hero when "broken" or "muted".

* And also missing icon above someone hit with "frostbite" showing the "disarm".

* When you buy something while dead (and with free slots) for it goes in the stash instead of immediately moving to the inventory.

* Also, add the option to keep the health bar and mp bar green and blue respectively when you play in colorblind mode.

* Is no longer possible to see breakdowns of enemy resistances to know things like when an AM has skilled mana sheild. I don't think that it would be intentional. (By Profepicman). (Im not sure if this is true, please someone confirm and PM me if this is not accurate)

* Before 7.00, I could type things to my allies while I moved my hero around. Now, when I right click it immediately closes the chat.

* Should add another option to control the new shrines, seen so many accidently turn them on just because they wanna run to them (sometimes people wanna run there but wait for their team to catch up so they can use them togheter, instead they just turn them on while team is not even there). Maybe we should have a option next to the glyph/scan which activates the shrine closests to your hero. Also a hotkey that you can bind to this.

* Please let them make an option where you can turn on to permanently see allied hp and mana without pressing ALT !!! Only a few guys mentioned it but its pretty important!!

* Make it possible to swap heroes in picking screen instead of when game has started

* If you use alt + (hot key) for items, and use quickcast, you can't self use items by hovering you mouse over your hero portrait anymore.
I'm pretty sure it's because when you press alt it now brings up that screen with your KDA cs etc, infront of your hero portrait.

* Don't let the HUD adjust its own length. (switching from 4 spell unit to 6 spell unit)

* Hero portrait should be completely clear. (currently it shows status icons, for example when silenced)

* Hero control HUD shouldn't shake when stunned. (overall remove all "cosmetic" effects)

* If there is more than 1 selected unit, it should show hero portrait AND smaller icons. (same way as in pre-7.00)


Anything else we need to add? 

(will update with more things from the comments)

Tried taking as many comments as I can into consideration now, hard to read through them all, PM me if you think I really forgot something here. Not just UI changes, bugs/missing options aswell.

Since many are asking and commenting about this I just wanna make clear that I don't think the UI is better than it was before 7.00. "Better and better" means that it's becoming better by everyday since 7.00 was released. I still liked the old one better, but I sure see potential in having a smaller UI, It just needs a couple of tweaks~|suggest

Concept for a Jakiro Rework|i.imgur.com||suggest
Orgs, if you're going to take down NoobFromUA at least give us a good official alternative.|self.DotA2|~There were hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Dota fans that relied on NoobFromUA to provide them with condensed highlight videos of games that they would never be able to watch. It was the perfect way for people like me, who aren't able to stay up the entire night on a weekday to watch 8 hours of Dota, for 5 nights a week.

And yeah, there are Twitch VOD's, but those still aren't condensed. A NoobFromUA vid shortened a BO3 series to 25 minutes or less, while still making it feel like you didn't miss anything. A lot of Dota 2 viewers just don't have the time to watch full VOD's of every single game played, but like to keep up with every single match.

My point is, just come out with something official for us to use. Maybe even hire NoobFromUA to make that content for you. IMO it doesn't even matter if I have to watch/see ads or whatever, as long as the content is still available, I think most people will be happy.



EDIT: People are letting me know that PGL has started uploading highlights to their youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/PGLeSport

However after watching last nights highlights, they dont seem nearly as good as NFUAs. Also this is only PGL, and doesnt solve the problem for other tournaments. Still think the best option is to officially involve NFUA, or (as people have also pointed out) do what Epicenter did and have NFUA run PGL ads before/after the vid.


EDITx2: Yes people, we know that what NFUA was doing was illegal. Yes he was stealing content. Yes he was going to get taken down eventually. Yes he was a thief. 

However thats not the point of this post. Whoever NFUA was doesnt matter, what matters is that the Dota community has lost its primary source of high-quality highlights, a service that many people depended on to watch Dota. Please use this post to discuss what should be done about this issue, and not to slam NFUA. Theres other posts in which you can do that. ~|suggest esports

It makes sense lore-wise but that is frogcicle tier balancing.  Razor has been a shit tier hero for a while, so why not just fuck it and let him be melee too?

**WHY RAZOR SHOULD BE MELEE**

**1. Whip is a melee weapon**

In most video games, whip counts as a melee weapon.  Hell, in DnD, whip is a melee weapon.  Ranged weapons are usually defined by projectiles that travel as far as they can go before hitting the ground.  Whips have limited range as defined by its length.  There is no projectile in the whip, the whip never leaves the user's hand.  NAME ME ONE OTHER HERO IN DOTA THAT IS RANGED AND DOESN'T SHOOT ANY PROJECTILE OF ANY KIND.  That's right. Razor is alone and he should be with his melee brethren.

**2. Razor is designed to be up and close to his enemies**

2 out of 3 of Razor's spells is only effective if he is close to his enemies.  With Static Link, Razor needs to be within range to continuously drain the damage.  Same goes with the Eye of the Storm.  In most cases, you have to be up in front in team fights as Razor to steal damage.  The only spell that contradicts this is Plasma Field but that spell is mostly used to punish enemies who are trying to get out of your range

**3. Benefits he will get from becoming a melee hero**

* He can buy stout shield and quelling blade to further boost his early laning stage
* Vanguard will actually become viable on the hero
* He will be effective with skull basher (Might be too OP)
* He can cleave with Battlefury or Empower (But he doesnt really need cleave)
* Never miss uphill
* Sange and Yasha is usually a core on the hero and he should get the full benefit of it

He will lose the benefit of Dragon Lance and Hurricane Pike which might be a downside but Razor shouldn't be played like a bow wielding pussy.

Denying to neutrals needs to be nerfed, so here is my proposa|self.DotA2|~What was once thought of as a sign of skill and luck, running from three guys chasing you into a pack of jungle creeps praying for them to last hit you for that last ditch deny, has become a disgusting Purge like obsession with efficiency and cowardice. 


The new trend in pro games is to be hyper efficient and deny yourself not when being chased with low hp, but when you dont want to walk back to base and have spent all your gold, have surived a teamfight but want to go get a item, or in rtz's case confusion and or boredom. This is not high risk high reward gameplay, this is cheap and boring.


To remedy this, i have come up with a fool proof idea to add depth and risk into denying to creeps.


**Creeps should level up just like heros when they get a kill on a player, transforming them into JUNGLE PREDATORS**


Here are some basics for Jungle Predators


* unlike jungle creeps, jungle predators do not move in easy reliable ways to promote stacking. Instead they behave erratically, and use movement skills to ensure they are in the camp to prevent more creeps from being spawned.

* JUNGLE Predators have massive hp and mana compared to their old forms, as well as gaining ultimates.

* jungle predators cannot be enchanted, dominated, eaten, midas-ed, or converted untill they are in deny range.

* dying to or creating a jungle predator (dying to a standard neutral) puts all forms of tp on cooldown for 2 minutes.

* killing a predator drops a "creep tear". This item can be used on yourself and enemies and allows you to hear the death screams of every creep on the map, at full volume even in the fog of war. New screams added for lane creeps. Lasts for 10 minutes. 

* predators do triple damage, but also give triple xp and gold when killed. 

* all predators have a "iorn orb" passive that reflects and blocks iorn talons on to the caster 


**Types of Jungle Predators**


When a hero dies to a jungle creep, they become a jungle predator. While also gaining all of the buffs above, they do a physical transformation which makes them larger and or diffrent looking and gives them additional "ults". This form is shared by any one of the creeps in a specific "camp" (i.e. any Satyr will turn into a Teller if they get a hero kill)


Here are the different jungle predator forms. 


**KOLBOLD MOTIVATOR**


Speed aura replaced with "motivation". When a enemy comes within melee distance of the Kobold Motivator, he will run at the enemy unit at max movement speed hitting it with his whip at max attack speed for exponential damage each hit (first hit is 2hp, next is 4hp, next is 8hp). The kobold will not stop hitting the unit untill it dies or the target dies. Kobold Motivatior is not effected by fog of war and has true sight (cannot break sight). Cannot be controled while in motivation mode. 


**MOUNTAIN TROLL**


Hill troll heal and mana aura becomes a new skill called "Shadow Relm". Shadow Relm is immediately cast upon transformation to Mountain Troll. Shadow Relm is a aoe much like voodoo restoration, but its aoe increases every time it is cast while the unit is stationary. Cast time is the same as troll's normal healm. Any units in the aoe lose mana equal to mana aura and health equal to heal. If any regen items are used in the aoe (slaves, clarities, urn) the effects are reversed (heal items take away equal hp, mana is drained from clarities, ect). Aoe grows as long as the Troll is alive and casting, and has no limit.


**Vhoul Deceiver**


Upon transformation, the Vhoul Deceiver leaves its camp and hides in another random camp in the jungle. It then takes the form of one of the creeps in its new camp. If attacked and not killed, it will leave the camp if no enemies have sight and move to a new camp. Gains 2 skills: Deflection: Deflects all skills and items that are not vanilla right clicks to the caster, including non target skills and items such as hand of midas and helm of the dominator. BioVenom: upon death, explodes in a techies like suicide that covers a area in a poison gale. 


**SPECTRE**


If any member of the ghost camp kills a hero they transform into litterally specter the hero. Specter spawns at lvl 25 with no item and is controlled like a bot, attacking anyone who enters the jungle where she spawned. Will ult when any hero is in deny range and steals kills from both teams with haunt. If specter kills herosnshe gets gold and can buy items. If all heros are dead on the map specter will push objectives. If specter destorys a ancient the jungle creeps win and both teams lose 50mmr dispite if they are playing ranked. 


**Succubus**


If a harpy camp member gets a kill, they transform into a Succubus. The Succubus has a passive ability called MARRIAGE. MARRIAGE allows it to follow any hero that comes into its aoe, at first having no effect, but after a while it will start to drain the affected hero's gold exponentially. While following the hero, the Succubus is invulnerable and cannot be targeted. The Succubus will only leave the effected hero if the hero affected a-clicks the succubus, it will activate its passive DIVORCE and return to its camp, taking half of the gold of the hero affected with it. If the gold gained is less than the gold the hero had when first attracting the Succubus, all pasive gold earned by the hero will go to the Succubus untill it dies. 


The Succubus will randomly change targets if the hero dies in close proximity to another hero, and may "cheat", following another hero. All heros lose money to succubus untill it dies. Succubus can only be targeted by enemy teams of the effected hero or the hero affected. When the unit dies, it drops "fancy clothes" based on how much money it leached from heros. The fancy clothes provide no stats boosts or effects and are worthless but can be traded to shop owners for 1 gold each.


**Centuar Stampeder**


Centuars gain the ultimate "stampede" with a aghs effect and will run towards heros when 3 or more are close enough together for a war stomp. If the Centuar is able to war stomp with three or more heros in its aoe, it will continue to stomp untill it is out of mana. When there is not enough mana to cast stomp the Centuar runs to the closest cliff and runs off it and dies. 


Stop cooldown is reduced to .5 seconds, mana cost reduced to 25, and mana is quadrupled. 


**Omega Wolf**


The omega wolf gians several new abilities.
STALK: turns omega wolf invisible but emits a growling sound when near.
OMEGA POUNCE: much like mirana's leap, the wolf jumps incredible distances.
DRAG: much like batriders lasso, the wolf is able to bite the foot of a hero and drag them to it's original camp. The hero plays a animation grabbing at the ground and screaming while it is being pulled for a short time. Drag is a channeled spell and can be interupted with a ally stun.
MATE TO DEATH: if a hero is dragged back to the spawn camp, the omega wolf mounts them and starts to drain 1% of hp every .25 seconds untill the heros death. If a enemy or ally hero approaches the "den" the rate of MATE will increase rapidly as the wolf attempts to finish before the hero can be saved via a stun. Auditory noises from the jungle are played during mate and get faster as mating increases. 


If there are multiple Omega Wolfs, they will hunt together and create mating dens, random points on the map that act as creep camps to mate in. If dens are created and no heros have been caught in 5 minutes, wolves will hint couriers. 



**TELLERS**


If any unit from a Satyr camp kills a hero, they become Tellers. Tellers gain a passive abilty called "Charge". CHARGE: Teller holds a stance and begins channeling as soon as it is spawed. Every death on the map (lane creeps, jungle creeps, heros, rosh) charges the Teller's shockwave attack. When heros enter the camp AOE, the Teller releases Shockwave. Shockwave now has 3 forms.
1. Shockwave: a increased damage shockwave from collecting a small amount of spirits
2. CAME WAY YA NAY HA: a massive shockwave energy blast that lingers for several seconds, after collecting a moderate amount of spirits
3.Final Form Spirit Bomb: a planet destroying shockwave that when casts kills every non jungle creep unit in the Tellers jungle.
4. Not even my final form spirit bomb: if roshan dies, and each enemy dies on both teams before a shockwave was released, Teller turns Gold and goes Super Satyr" foating to the center of the mid lane when discovered and launches the SUPER SATYR SPIRIT BOMB- killing every unit on the map including all creeps, heros and roshan. 

Note: Tellers make auditory charge sounds as they charge shockwaves. These sounds are a man yelling and gasping for air.


**Godless Golem**


Cooldown of rock throw reduced to .10 seconds
Killing a shard unit creates 2 mini shard units
Shard and mini shard units mana cost for rock throw reduced to 0.


**OGER GOD**
Frost armor effect lasts 20 more seconds.

An Open Letter to all the big Esports Companies Out There|self.DotA2|~Dear Important People*,  
  
*(You all know who you are, you're the ones who run the whole shebang. You're organising tournaments, you're booking talent, you're the ones assembling a list of people and teams and so forth. You're the ones with all the cheddar and people like me are the tiny little mice trying to get some for our starving mice families. We live in a hole in the wall. A HOLE IN THE WALL.)  
  
This is a simple request: please can you try to plan ahead a little further than two weeks at a time. I can't believe for one second that you are living day to day after all these years of Dota 2 being on the scene. Take a calendar, look at the dates on it, plan ahead a few months and think to yourselves "maybe people will have their own shit planned unless we give them a head's up".  
  
It's fine, I get it. You're worried something will change. You're worried you might need to shift a date, or someone will emerge from the shadows and you want to hire them instead of the person you spoke to three months ago. Well that's not cool. Everyone has a life of their own outside Dota (except Tobi obviously) and everyone needs a bit of notice before they fly halfway around the World to watch videogames for a couple of weeks.  
  
I realise this is not your problem, but at the very least you could understand why it's someone else's problem, and it's one of your making.

Valve: A Proposed solution to last minute roster-drop problem|self.DotA2|~Whether intentional or not, there is a huge problem facing the current system of adding and removing players from teams: the single day roster-lock. Because this lock is a single day, teams could simply align a new, available player in secret before dropping their teammate days or minutes before the lock. This leaves the dropped player severely disadvantaged in finding a team in a fair amount of time.

My proposition is as follows: instead of having a single day that teams can no longer add or remove players, **there are two dates instead: a "drop-lock" and an "add-lock"**. Once the drop-lock occurs, a team can no longer drop any of their players. But, any players dropped the day of this are not in vain: they still have some time left to find a new team. Any team with fewer than five players can still add players to their team before the add-lock date, perhaps two weeks after the drop-lock. This would easily and effectively solve the problem of unfairly excluding very talented players from acquiring a team quickly enough.

Any thoughts on this revised system?~|suggest esports

6.87 is a great patch but the presentation feels rushed. Here's a list of #polish suggestions|self.DotA2|~**No new item sound effects**

* Tome of Knowledge is very underwhelming. It recycles the level up animation and is completely silent.

* Bloodthorn recycles the Orchid sound effect, when it should have its own unique sound. I've always adored Dota 2's sound design because you can tell what's happening with your eyes closed. This trend should continue.

* Hurricane Pike also recycles the Force Staff sound effect. Such a huge opportunity for some amazing sound effects with a name like HURRICANE PIKE.

* Blight Stone might not be required, but could be nice to have a very small sound effect like a mini Desolator impact sound.

&nbsp;

**Aghs upgrades are getting messy**

This might not be a huge issue once we get the upcoming UI update, but [as this post already covered](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4htvqb/wouldnt_it_be_nice_to_have_cooldown_on_aghs_with/), there is no feedback to the player for some of the newer Aghs upgrades, such as what the Aghs upgrade does and failing to display the cooldowns.

**Scan uses recycled assets and is a little confusing at first**

[As discussed on this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4hadd4/til_scan_uses_the_same_minimap_indicator_as/d2onvg5), Scan should not use the TP minimap assets. In addition, it isn't immediately obvious to players what green or red mean when using scan.

&nbsp;

**Scan is unfriendly to spectators**

/u/somethingToDoWithMe:
> The scan ability is extremely spectator unfriendly. Both teams have the same color of scan so when a scan is used, you have to take notice of the team and how recently the scan was used to figure out which team used the scan.

>I also feel that having something that important be only on the minimap is bad for spectating. I think they need to show something over the actual ingame map so that observers can just move the camera over to the location and show the viewers what the area scanned was.


/u/aliboy:
> A voice line and event text should show up - similar to what exists currently for fortifying structures. Scan should have a default announcer line that says something along the lines of;

> "Dire have activated Scan"

> "Radiant have activated Scan"

> And when you are in game and your team uses it the announcer should say " Scan activated"


/u/VampoRainze:
> show scan in game not just minimap.

&nbsp;

**Dota lore**

/u/thjake:
> no lore for new items and abilities since 6.86


/u/-De-Koenisch-:
> Please rename Scan into something less technical.


I agree with this. Scan should be renamed to something that fits the lore of Dota a little better. I've heard various suggestions such as:

* Scry
* Eye of the Ancient (/u/SirActionSlacks-)
* Light of Heaven (/u/phipb)

Feel free to post any additional suggestions and I'll add them here. I've always loved Dota 2's attention to detail and level of polish, and I hope Valve's dedication to presentation doesn't wane for future patches.~|suggest

The sets could be created in cooperation with the winning team (like the Treasure of the Eternal Alliance).

If you're close to reaching a crucial level it would be great to be able to tell this quickly, as it can change the outcome of a fight if your team plays accordingly.    
It's also useful for telling a teammate to stay out of XP range, so I can have solo XP and reach, for example, level 6.

Quests shouldn't have timers.|self.DotA2|~There have been many posts of people rushing an item that shouldn't be rushed and ruining games because of quests, that require you to get an item before a certain minute mark.

A quest should not be failed till the game is over. A lot of people will simply give up on the game if they don't get in item by the required minute mark.

In the future Valve should avoid puting timers on quests, but rather make us buy the item and then do something with it.
For instance "Build solar crest before game timer reaches X/Y/Z minutes." would now be "Purchase a Solar crest and kill 2/4/6 heroes that are affected by the Solar crest debuff."

So in general instead of rushing an item a quest would have you buy an item and then do something with it.

This type of quest allows us to get the item at any point in the game. Getting the item sooner will give you more time to complete the quest, but you also won't risk failing the quest if you don't rush it. It's also a lot more support friendly than the item rush quests.



**TL;DR:** Quests should not have timers that fail before the game ends, as that disincentivizes players from trying to win the game if they fail such a quest.

Please Remove The Hero of The Day from Ranked|self.DotA2|~I love the idea of rotating heros of the day, but I do not feel that it has a place in ranked.  It just gives an advantage to picking a few heroes and promotes spamming them in ranked.  The mango itself is kind of silly to me, but I feel that it gives a weird advantage right now and can be balanced a bit more if not removed entirely.  Instead of giving the mango to people that simply pick the hero of the day, give it to people that random.  

Edit: There seems to be confusion in the comments.  I have literally no problem with randoming, and I do not think that this is a sign of the end times.  However, I feel that ranked should be mostly free of advantages like this.  Randoming gave a risk vs reward deal because you could random into bad heroes for your line up, heroes that are easily counter able, or even bad heroes in the meta.  To balance this out, dota gave you some extra gold to make you feel better about doing it.  This never decided matches flat out and neither does the mango.  However, the risk vs reward deal is mostly gone with the Hero of the Day.  This is because you can pick a hero out of the 10 and get a reward.  For example, I have been picking TA and she becomes the hero of the day.  I now have an advantage when spamming her for that day.  With randoming that was impossible because you did not know what you were going to get.  I feel that this mechanic is cool as it promotes players to have larger hero pools, but I do not feel that it has a place necessarily in ranked.  I do not want my ranked games to be influenced (not decided) by a hero of the day mechanic that seems to be geared towards newer players.  Sorry for any confusion and sorry to the devs for complaining.  I genuinely love dota 2 and I love the new patch so far.  Keep up the great work.

Edit 2: I might be wrong about it being a hero of the day.  If it is not I am sorry, but I still believe that the risk vs reward is too small.  However, many people have brought up good points that these are like small balance changes to heroes in each game.  I think thats actually a really cool way of thinking about it and I think its useful to remember that when you discuss this change.~|suggest

Petition to get improved punishment system in Dota 2|self.DotA2|~Dear Valve,
I am a very big fan of your game, but it comes with a heavy toll on my spirit, welfare and mood. I simply cannot comprehend how so many people wish for the same thing and nothing is done to improve on it: **Improve your punishment system.**

These last 2 days alone I suffered 8 griefers in 12 games. Intentional feeding, selling items, ruining lanes all that kind of jazz, and I am 5.000 MMR. The fact that I feel these kids go unpunished is very harsh on my dream to improve. 

Even the pro players such as Puppey agree that intentionally feeding couriers, yourself etc. should be punished **WAY HARDER** than playing 5 more games in low prio. You simply need to **start dashing out some bans or minus mmr punishments**. People misbehave so much lately, and nobody cares if they get sent to low prio. 

I switched away from HoN because the community was so toxic. I can't believe I am about to give up on Dota because of the same issue. Please. Please. Do something about this.

MMR boosting sites even proudly display this as the way they make sure you are safe to be boosted:

*"We are much more interested in keeping our customers happy and satisfied that can come back to us again or recommend our services to their friends.

Riki can be sold for his death value gold (amount of gold given to a single hero if they kill Riki. Riki can be consumed, transfering his total hit points and mana to the hero. Upon consumation or selling, Riki is killed. Upon respawn, Riki is fully controllable again, and all transfered passive buffs are returned to Riki. If the target hero dies while Riki is in their inventory, Riki is transferred to the closest flying animal courier. If no animal courier is available, Riki will lose an extra 120 gold and an animal courier will spawn at the base, with Riki in its inventory.

If the animal courier holds Riki in its inventory, it will gain Riki's passives, however will not gain an auto-attack.

The only way for Riki to emerge from item form is the death of the host hero, consumation or selling.~|suggest

Valve should introduce more ways to earn compendium points|self.DotA2|~At this moment we can't really earn new levels without buying additional points or 50 level compendium. Points drop rarely. So there are my suggestions:  
  
* **Aegis Offering/Recycle system** - TI4 recyling system should be added. This gave points every week for your unwanted items.  
* **Old achievements** - By this I mean 10 Hero challenge and daily hero challenge, reliable ways to earn additional points.  
* **Points Charm** - Many hates this idea, but that would be great if compendium owners will get these. 3 Correct Predictions - 50 points. 2 Incorrect Predictions - 2 charms fragments/100 coins.  
* **Player Cards** - I wonder if they actually introduce this. Last year we were collecting cards to get spectator gems and points for all cards. Volvo pls  
* **Points for collecting Immortals** - Ex. you get all non-rare items from first chest you get some points.   
* **Challenges for points** - Just like actual challenges, but grants you points instead.  
* **Points Betting/Predictions** - You pay points and choose which team you think will win. If you were right you get back points + additional points. However if you were wrong, then you lose all points you bet. More points you bet = More points you will get.  
  
That's all I came up with. Hope Valve will see it.

Valve can we have a mini AI tournament for TI6?|self.DotA2|~We can do something like this: http://sscaitournament.com/

Not only would this be entertaining but it'd give us [hopefully] better AI. The tournament winning AI doesn't necessarily have to be put into the game, if for example it simply isn't scripted well or properly. If anything the tournament could serve as an inauguration of sorts, the beginning of community collaboration on the AI. I feel like Dota has come so far yet our bots remain absolutely atrocious. All it would take on Valve's part would be to make the current bot AI open source and to put like.. 1000$ (pocket change for GabeN) on the line for the winner. Like I said, if for some reason Valve deems the winning AI subpar then worst case scenario we had a super refreshing and entertaining mini tournament, and a better starting point for further AI work.
What do we think?


EDIT:    ..  but perhaps certain rules could be stipulated to prevent this, that is, for example, the winner is not simply the bot that wins that games, but rather behaves the most like a human!~|suggest

Re: Blink Penalty|self.DotA2|~(Yes a million threads complaining about this have been made before, but hear me out).

If the blink mechanic is to stay (which looks likely), what could  make it vastly easier to learn is to provide some sort of visual/auditory feedback. This way you would know when you have blinked over the max range or when you have succeeded in clicking between 960-1200 units.

&nbsp;

For example;

* If you blink 960 units or less (which would include clicking over 1200 and being punished) the game plays the standard blink sound and animation.
* If you blink over 960 units the game plays a slightly modified blink sound to indicate you have made a good blink.

I believe this would make the mechanic far more accessible to those attempting to learn it as it provides positive feedback after every blink, forcing the player to eventually learn the range subconsciously.

Invoker Buff/Rework: MasterZed's Solution|self.DotA2|~I'm the guy that posted [A Brief History of Invoker.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3d8ris/a_brief_history_of_invoker/)

This is suggested mini-rework that streamlines Invoke and the Aghanims upgrade, as well as a simple buff in what I feel is an overall better design. I've been sitting on this idea for about 6 years now - thought now might be a good time to post it.

&nbsp;

##Short Version:

**Invoke:**   
*Invoke is now a core ability gotten for free at level 1.*    

* Think Earth Spirit stone remnants. You start the game with Invoke level 0. Points can be put into Invoke to improve it.
* 20 Mana at all levels    
* 30s CD at Invoke level 0
* 20/14/9/5s CD at Invoke levels 1/2/3/4, first available at level 6/9/12/16.

&nbsp;

**Aghanim's Sceptre:**    
*Removes mana cost for Invoke, and adds one effective level to Quas, Wex, Exort AND Invoke.*    

 * Applies to orbs passive bonus AND what they give to spells. Lvl 7 Quas would be considered lvl 8, giving 8hp/s per orb (instead of 7hp/s) and creating an icewall that slows for 160% and lasts 13.5s (instead of 140% and 12s). Lvl 1 Exort would be considered lvl 2 etc.    
 * Invoke is likewise lifted one effective level - lvl 3 Invoke would be considered lvl 4 with 5s CD. Level 4 Invoke is lifted to a special Aghs only level 5, with a 2s CD.

&nbsp;

Invoke Level|Level Available|Invoke CD|Aghs Invoke CD
:--|:--|:--|:--
0|1 (Free @ Lvl 1)|30s|20s
1|6|20s|14s
2|9|14s|9s
3|12|9s|5s
4|16|5s|2s

&nbsp;

**What do these changes mean:**    

* In effect, it's as if Invoker starts the game at level 2 instead of level 1, as he doesnt need to invest a point into Invoke to get spells. The net result is that for the first few levels (until he puts a point into Invoke) one orb will be one level higher, giving a subtle but effective buff to everything he does. QW could get a point in E to help with LH, EQ could get a point in W to flash farm or neutral etc.    
* Invoker will start the game picking from one of three spells (like every other hero), get a second spell at level 2 (like every other hero) and then get a power spike at level 6 that peaks at level 16, with an ultimate that actually scales well.    
* Aghanim's gives everything it did before PLUS additional functionality above just a CD reduction - something needed since the introduction of Octarine Core.

&nbsp;

##Longer version:

*Why does Invoker need a buff:*    

* In public games he has the 14th lowest win rate at 42%, which drops further as MMR drops. Public win rate is only *one* factor among many - there are many heroes that have low pub win rates (such as Wisp) BUT they are still viable picks in higher level and pro games. However:    
* Professionally he fares just as bad or worse - in the TI5 group stages he had the lowest effectiveness of the 90 or so heroes picked, losing 5 out of 5 games. By the main event teams had abandoned him, and Invoker was never picked once. He literally was the worst hero at TI5.

&nbsp;

*What is wrong with Invoker that requires buffing?*    

* In short, the meta has left him behind. The biggest change was the introduction of dual runes - mid is now dominated by heroes with low CD nukes that get guaranteed bottle refills. This allows them to easily CS, lane clear to get runes, and quickly pressure the enemy tower should their opponent leave the lane.    
* QW simply can't lane against the common mids, and his CS suffers terribly. He has no flash farm to make up for lost CS, unlike most other mids.    
* E style builds are far too level dependant and take too long to come online. The meta is all about quickly transitioning into ganks and team fights. The days of slow farming mids that spend ten minutes in lane are gone, and EQ has been left behind in the faster paced game.    
* This is not suggestion that other mid heroes don't also need a nerf. But the game itself has changed, and become faster paced. I feel Invoker won't be a viable pick in the game without some sort of rework to make him come online faster - something buffing spells won't achieve.

&nbsp;

*Why is this rework good?*    

* It doesnt just tweak a number here or there, it enhances the essence of what makes the Invoker unique by boosting his core functionality. I believe it handles *many* of Invoker's flaws in one subtle change, while at the same time simplifying him. Most suggested changes I see are sort of clunky band-aid fixes - this goes to the root of the problem.    
* Players can use this extra flexibility to build Invoker how they want - QW could get a point of E at lvl 2 to help its low base damage OR keep the same build and leave lane a level earlier. E builds could invest in a level of W to wave clear with meteor. In short, it keeps the skill ceiling high, without lowering the skill floor.    
* It alleviates his major weakness: level dependence (what forces him to go mid). Invoker could more easily safelane or offlane, and actually contribute at lvl 1 and 2. QW invoker can start ganking 1 level earlier, putting him on par with heroes like Storm, TA, QoP etc. EQ Invokers rushing dual spirits won't take so long to come on-line - experienced players know there is a huge xp jump required to go from level 8 to 9, so being able to get them at 8 is about 3 minutes quicker.     
* It doesnt homogenize and make Invoker like other heroes. I've seen suggestions to give Invoker a new spell that is a low CD spammable nuke, just like the other mids. Homogenization is the bane of game design.  The rework doesnt just hand over a mindless buff, players must use skill to earn the buff this rework gives - the very essence of what playing Invoker entails. A flat base damage boost might help lower skill players (ie lower the skill floor) but it does nothing to enhance the potential skill ceiling higher skill players can achieve.    
* Best of all, it doesnt change his overall power curve. Generally, mid and late game Invoker is well balanced. This buff is only evident at early levels - once you invest your first point into Invoke (typically around level 6 or 7), the power curve normalizes and you are at the same level power as before.    
* In short, I feel that having to invest a skill point in order to start invoking spells is a relic of an older age of DotA, where limitations from the Warcraft map editor still lingered. If Invoker was made from scratch right now, I believe the ability for Invoker to Invoke spells would just be an intrinsic part of the hero, like Earth Spirit and his remnants.


&nbsp;

*Cold Snap at level one? Won't that be OP?*    

* This I suspect will be the biggest complaint, and it might have been valid - once. Cold snap is so heavily nerfed now that its barely even worth casting in lane to harass with. A max of 4 (but most likely 2 or 3) 0.4s stuns, each doing 7 dmg - far less dangerous than many other lvl 1 spells. Dont forget that Invokers get cold snap at lvl 2, and you dont see them breaking the game at that point. 

&nbsp;

*Why not just buff some spell or add some extra effect to a spell?*    

* I've seen a lot of suggestions to this effect. The first problem is that buffing a particular spell (such as reverting the forge spirit nerf) only helps *some* builds. What is good about this rework, is that it very slightly buffs ALL spells and all builds (as on average one orb will be one level higher) - but only early game, then it normalizes.    
* I've also seen a lot of suggestions to give more BKB-piercing ability to spells. Again, this only benefits builds that use that particular spell. In my opinion its bad design to start giving everyone spells that go through BKB (again, homogenization). Balance stems from heroes having strengths and weaknesses, and using those strengths to overcome your enemies. Icefrog has so expertly balanced this game by building on strengths to buff a hero, rather than removing weaknesses and making everything bland.

&nbsp;
	
*Why not just buff base damage?*    

* It's true that this would help WQ, but E builds dont need more base damage - they have other problems. This rework gives WQ the option to pick up a level of E (say at level 2 or 3) to help last hit, without making EQ OP (which necessitated the nerf in the first place). Alternatively, if WQ is laning ok (say against a Dragon Knight) he can begin ganking a level earlier, something much more valuable than a +X to dmg.

&nbsp;

*Why not make Aghanim's a more compelling upgrade with extra spell effects?*    

* This is another commonly seen suggestion. I feel my idea is better as it builds towards simplicity, rather than increasing complexity and having to code and balance extra spells or spell effects. A player can pick up aghs, and instantly know what it does without having to read spell descriptions.    
* This new Aghs would give a uniform burst of power whether gotten early game as first item, or late game as 3rd or 4th. It would work on, and improve, all builds and styles of Invoker play whether pusher, ganker, semi-carry etc. It wouldnt be 'must have' overshadowing other items, yet would always remain a viable pickup. Lastly, it would help differentiate Aghs from OC.    
* I also see a lot of '360 degree deafening blast should be a part of Aghs.' Having this as soon as Aghs is picked up would be OP, but my suggested rework could allow the 360 degree blast to be gotten up to 3 lvls earlier, depending on how skill points are assigned (ie take all orbs to lvl 6).

&nbsp;

*What's with the rescaling of Invoke?*    

* Invoke scales very strangely. Combined with the increasing mana cost per level causes players to get 1 level of Invoke, then leave it until 15/16/17. Having a flat mana cost and rescaling Invoke CD to 22/15/10/5 gives a compelling reason to skill it up. But most importantly players still have the choice - builds such as rushing dual spirits relying primarily on spirits/snap would probably keep Invoke low.    
* 20 mana for all levels of Invoke was chosen simply because the old system of increasing mana cost stopped players from even leveling the skill - the core aspect of the hero (Invoking) became overly prohibitive. Especially now with the ability to swap Invoke slots, the mana cost was too high. From a "logical" design perspective, it shouldn't increase each level unless the spell actually does something extra.    
* Aghs Invoke CD reduction also scales really confusingly - reducing by 6s/9s/8s, then only 3s at level 4. This rework gets both normal and Aghs CD on the same simple scale, plus cleverly includes the 2s Invoke CD as a special Aghs only lvl 5 Invoke.    
* I've moved Invoke skill ups to 6/9/12/16. This is for two reasons: firstly it helps bring the power curve more in line with other heroes - a big boost at 6, then hitting max at 16. Secondly, players are unlikely to skill up Invoke at all until around lvl 6 or so anyway - this simplifies things and avoids the 'bad player trap'. The only reason Invoke had to be made available at 2/7/12/17 was out of necessity to actually have spells to cast - this rescale makes 'Invoke' worthy of being an ultimate.

&nbsp;

##Summary:  
I've been playing DotA for over a decade now, and have at least 3000 games of Invoker. I worked in the early days doing play testing, and was one of the ones who submitted suggestions when Invoker was first reworked (6.50).

On the whole, I feel that this is a simple and elegant restructuring of Invoker, that gives a subtle but useful buff early game that evens out by mid game, as well as making other styles of play and other builds viable without 'dumbing down' the hero. Lastly, the Aghs/Invoke rework streamlines and simplifies it, as well as giving a meaningful buff to an item that needs it.

I hope you like this suggestion. If so please help by promoting it and bringing it to the attention of those that make the big decisions.

Can we host a DotA tournament for TB?|self.DotA2|~I'm a shit redditor so bare with me.

Totalbiscuit and his videos have been apart of my life for a long time now, getting me involved in the PC gaming industry as well as getting me into both DotA and Terraria among other things so i was wondering if maybe we (as a community) could hold a tournament out of respect, with maybe any money that we make (if we do) goes to a liver cancer charity or something.  

I have no idea if this has already become an idea or whatever but hey i thought i'd make a piece about it.  Any feedback would be great.

p.s. i'm shit at formatting.

(EDIT) After some people have raised the point over the last few hours about TB maybe not wanting something like this going on, I have instead asked my partners who have started working on this whether they are up for turning this into a charity tournament in which the winning team chooses a charity in which we give the money too.  TB shall not be related with this directly due to the opinions voiced.

Thanks for all the feedback provided so far, it has really helped!

(EDIT 2) For anyone who wants to help in anyway to get this tournament going head on over to r/dotamasterrace and head to the stickied post.  There should be a fair bit of info regarding our current developments.

Also for those who want to sign their teams up for the tourney you can head over to the Team Building thread that is also stickied on r/dotamasterrace~|suggest esports

Can Some Sort Of Prime Matchmaking Be Introduced Into Dota 2?|self.DotA2|~For those that don't know, prime matchmaking is a system that has been incorporated into cs-go not to long ago. Basically you can only use the prime matchmaking servers if you register your account to a phone number, you must also have a level 21 account. Only one account can be registered to a phone number. Prime Matchmaking was made to combat smurfs and hackers in cs-go, as most people would register their main account to their phone. People often use alt accounts for hacking and smurfs obviously. So they couldn't register their smurf or hacked account into prime unless they bought a new phone for their alternate account.

On to why dota could use a variation of prime matchmaking. Right now theirs more account boosters and smurfs than ever before, that makes the game very unenjoyable. Its annoying to see that i have a level 87 profile, but im being matched up against a lvl 22 profile who is obviously a smurf or account buyer. A prime matchmaking system in dota would make games much more enjoyable for most people. Let the smurfs, account buyers, and boosters play together. This would clearly result in longer queue times, but even with a registered prime account you can still play normal ranked matches. Just to be clear your MMR would be the same in both Prime and ranked matches. It would just match you up with other users who have prime enabled. Anyways just a way to make the quality games better, this has been brought up before by others just thought i would reiterate it. Thanks :)

Edit: I see alot of comments about burner phones and such, this is 100% an issue. Was thinking maybe you have to be a certain level to join prime matchmaking? Not sure what that level should be.

Edit 2: /u/SirClarkus Just brought up the idea of making registered prime users enter a code sent by text at the start of each month in order to play prime matchmaking. This would be implemented so if someone bought a throw away phone they would have to pay the monthly fee to their phone carrier in-order to continue playing Prime Matchmaking. This might be a hassle to some people, but its still an idea worth discussing!

Valve need to make DOTA2 Bot Competition for programmers.|self.DotA2|~So, i have this idea after talking to my friend. Basically, valve make the open platform to bot programming. The competitor must make the hero picker, bot gaming style per hero, etc.

Competitor doesn't have to make all the hero bot, but the minimum is they must make minimum 10 hero bot. And in the competition, competitor cannot interfere with their bot decision at all.

The winner will have their bot featured in bot games until the next winner decided. (maybe 1 year?)

**Edit 1:**

This idea is come because reborn on it's way to be a main client, so why not?^^kappa

The competition will looks like TI, but bot team is competing with another bot team.

i don't know, i imagine that the custom code from programming platform will only play in one game mode, which is "custom bot games"

> "This would be cool, but literally all the game needs to have bots that don't suck is a way to communicate with them.

> Dota actually has solid bots, they just don't know how to handle real people and their actions." */u/goodnames679*

Dear Valve, on the eve of seasonal MMR, can you please release the official, final distribution of the phasing-out MMR system?|self.DotA2|~i understand why you were not interested in doing so before. and i actually think seasonal MMR is better; i'm excited. it'd just be nice to know once and for all the distribution as the old system phases out.

Dear Valve, please make an actual coin toss for Radiant/Dire/Firstpick at the TI7 main stage games inside the arena|self.DotA2|~The coin toss to decide which team can choose **firstpick/secondpick** or **side (Radiant/Dire)** is usually done in the pregame lobby. In almost every tournament the spectators and the casting panel don't get to see who chose what and who won the coin toss. So it would be cool to make the coin toss on stage and make the captains of the teams choose firstpick and side live in the arena.

Advantages of doing it live:

1. In many real sports such as football the coin toss marks that the game is about to start. It creates certain hype for the viewers.
2. The panel could comment on the choice of side and its implications before the game starts and not only when the first bans are already done.
3. It would be much easier for stats people to collect the side choices and create some statistics. This could help determining whether there is an actual Dire/Radiant advantage in the current patch/meta.
4. It gives some insight for the viewers on what a team prefers. Nobody usually takes the time to collect and publish this data (I have seen it only a few times by Noxville).

Bigger suggestion for the HUD|i.imgur.com||suggest
Make DOTA Great Again : A Wishlist for DOTA|self.DotA2|~A wishlist of everything I wish Valve did for DOTA 2:

**Provide a sense of community:**

* Address the solo focus of the game. The game has a lack of community, especially with the removal of guilds.
* Weekly/biweekly Battlecup, auto online tournaments even similar to War3/SC2. Ideally tournament qualifiers could be run through the Dota client itself.
* Guild/clan interface
* Guild competitions (guilds score points for battlecup/ranked)
* Revamp region chat
* Inhouse tournament interface and resources to host tourneys
* Facebook and social media integration (Popular Facebook groups such as Dota Trading)
* Most easily accessible through the front page, currently front page atm is mostly chests and useless clutter

**Long term goals outside of simply MMR**

Dota lacks any sense of progression. Even the profile trophy level is effectively meaningless. Dota at least used to have the old level up chest, which gave some kind of sense of reward for playing. Right now there is no incentive to play outside MMR.

* Permanent quest and loot system, give the quest system long term goals adding meaning to specific rewards, Zeus skin for 1000 games.
* Could add features such as server wide missions to reveal upcoming heroes / events / battle pass branches / chests

**Regular updates and maintenance**

* Proof check and update tool tips, fix all of the poor talent explanations and even add an alt hover on talents even
* Small balance passes (5-10% buffs/nerfs) on the game regularly, every 1-2months
* No major patch lasting more than 6 months
* Fixes to the watch tab, slow loading times, improper filtering, ordering of games, removal of cost of watching tournaments ingame, most want to watch the top tier games but has become difficult post ranked change
* Fix current ingame items that are broken such as this HUD https://i.imgur.com/JSDQpwI.jpg

**Unranked Draft Phase**

*  ~~~~Change or removed the unranked AP draft phase gone, my friends who play unranked seem to hate it, leads to frustration and counters which do not really have a place in a unranked environment~~~~



**Behaviour system lacking**

* Behaviour should not be put ahead of player skill in most situations
* Checking the reports with human oversight like CS:GO Overwatch.
* Additional options on report such as boosting and scripting

**More game customization**

* Profile customization, make it unique with loading screens and HUDs able to be used on profiles along with other items.
* Custom hero grids
* Custom item grids
* Custom friend list and ability to filter friends
* Loading screens used as backgrounds
* Hero showcase, allowing you to show off your fav hero/set combo

**Pro circuit integration**

I cant stress this one enough. Dotas biggest appeal to many is its esports scene, and youd barely even know it existed from the client alone. Having to access Pro Circuit points and standings and event times all on other third party sites is unacceptable. Even though Liquidpedia does a phenomenal job, it should be accessible in client, ESPECIALLY Minors and Majors, which are *Valve sponsored events*. Leaderboards should be visible in client too.

* Pro circuit information, updates and a leaderboard all shown and accessed easily ingame
* Circuit long fantasy competition to increase player investment in the circuit, prizes could be dota items but even some special rewards such as a chance to win a trip to TI / Major / Minor
* Ingame match ticker and news feed so all players can see when games are coming up, should be located on front page

**Fix the Arcade:**

* Provide Arcade with either a small scale permanent state version of the game, still located inside Dota (so that custom games don't require massive fixes every patch) OR Valve take care each patch to ensure they do not destroy the entire Arcade. This could even be by giving Arcade developers more time to prepare for patches, forewarning of what is changing on the backend, etc.
* New games find it difficult, if not impossible, to break into the current scene of Arcade games, leading to new games stopping development and dying, and even popular games slowly fade due to boredom because they are only games being played (see: ReIncarnation RPG).
* Every game should have dedicated servers, new games are often unplayable due to latency

**Bring back events**

We used to have events every few months which many players appreciated, some of my friends favorite thing about dota was seeing who could go the furthest in some of these events such as the Year Beast, appealing to many casual players. Valve should be having a major event every 6 months. Events such as:

* New Bloom
* Diretide
* Dark Moon
* Frostivus
* Wraith-Night
* Siltbreaker

**Items**

Workshop creators sold out, reduced profit margins, exclusivity of being included in immortal sets / TI / battlepasses leaves any leftout in the cold
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/62991t/the_dota_2_workshop_and_its_ecosystem_are_dying/

* Cosmetic value balance in general, cosmetics are generally now worthless or high price, variance across cosmetics seems weak
* Getting rid of features that some enjoyed such as item crafting from scrolls and item deleting with a chance to get a higher quality tier item, this might be problematic now with so many items but could still be implemented in a different way

**Tutorial**

* Create a brand new tutorial system, one that entices, inspires and shows new players the true potential of the game, would lead to many new players entering the game
* Tutorial could even have a few different branches aimed at different aspects of DOTA, allowing even older players to train and improve their skills even while waiting on queues ie. Tower / Creep last hitting

There is no excuse for Valve not updating the game with the amount of money and resources they have, we should expect more from Valve than what they give us. The goal of this isn't to directly criticize Dota itself as a game, but to look at the lack of focus and failure of Valve to keep the game and community moving forward. Just wanted to mention that many of these features have been in the game at some point or another, Valve can do it and should bring some of these features and ideas back. In general, Valve has had a real problem with implementing potentially *great* features and then either leaving them incomplete (such as spectate from Steam Browser) or removing them altogether (item recipes anyone?).

EDIT Added (reveal) on unlocking heroes

Status Resistance, what i think sucks;|self.DotA2|~allright, i know i'm nobody, but while i like the idea of status resistance, there's a few case where i feel it shouldn't apply.

first of all, it shouldn't apply to every kind of banish (OD's prison, SD's disruption..., and by extension, stuff like eul's/tornado) the reason is very easy: teamplay in dota is important, comboing spells between teammate is a thing, and it's just not possible to adapt your timing for every possible value, especially in a split second.

**Edit:** after all, those disables aren't stun, they disable, but they also protect the target for the duration, so their main usage is comboing. making comboing sort of "random" for those spells feels like bad design.

**Edit2:** also, those spells typically don't have a stun bar, making chaining stun even more difficult.

second: it shouldn't apply to channeled stun (fiend's grip and shackles). channels are debuff that disable the caster and the target, and seeing fiend's grip last 3 second on a late game DK is just ridiculous.

**Edit2:** also at the moment, thos spells get cut down in duration sharply, losing a lot of their duration. same for any DoT spell not tied to a slow.

third: although it already works like that, i'm still pointing it out: it shouldn't work on aura style debuff (chronosphere, BH, static storm)

TLDR: status resistance should only affect "shoot and forget" style debuffs, as opposed to channels. it also shouldn't affect disruption style debuffs to not screw with comboing/setting up between teammates.~|suggest

#1. Several updates to the ability tooltips

###Issues:

* Mist Coil shows the damage and heal in one line. Issue with this is, when pressing ALT, it shows amplified values. But the heal does not get amplified, so this is wrong information.
* Aphotic Shield doesn't list its damage type.
* Aphotic Shield should have a new line for its area damage. Its damage values are equal to the shield capacity value, but the damage is amplified by spell damage, while the capacity is not. So the damage should have its line and show amplified values when holding ALT, while the damage capacity line should not.

###suggestions:

* Add ALT notes to his abilities. Really, except for a single one on Borrowed Time, none of them have ALT notes. And there is plenty of information which could be added:
* Mist Coil's spell immunity interaction (can target allies, but not enemies)
* Mist Coil's projectile speed and it being disjointable
* Mist Coil's damage type on Abaddon (pure) and that it is lethal
* Aphotic Shield dealing aoe damage even when expiring or getting dispelled
* Aphotic Shield buff being inactive on Abaddon during Borrowed Time
* Aphotic Shield not damaging invisible/fogged enemies
* Curse of Avernus not slowing for illusions, but granting them the buff
* Curse of Avernus working against enemy buildings, but not for allied buildings
* Curse of Avernus buff being placed on attack begin, and debuff on attack hit
* Borrowed Time not healing from the damage instance which passively activates it
* Borrowed Time being castable while stunned, but not silenced, but can auto-activate even while silenced

[Here is an image showing the current tooltips compared to the suggested versions] (http://i.imgur.com/3QQ7goW.png) (modified npc_abilities and dota_english txt to show how it would look ingame)

###I prepared the npc_abilities and dota_english files, so they could be just copy-pasted over the original ones. At the bottom of this post, you can find the modified parts of those files.

#2. Add a visual effect to allies affected by Borrowed Time aura

The aghs aura from Borrowed Time has no visual feedback on affected allies whatsoever. This is a disadvantage for both, allies and enemies. Allies may forgot about the aghs and don't realise they are 50% more tanky now, and enemies may not notice that Abaddon having aghs and may overcomit on his team.

Here is an example of effects which could be used (using already existing effects from Borrowed Time)

I replaced Drum of Endurance's visual effects with abaddon_borrowed_time_h.vpcf and abaddon_ambient_mist_b.vpcf. They are clearly visible, but not too much and can directly be associated with Abaddon, so it would be easy to tell that that hero is affected by Borrowed Time aura. The aura only lasts up to 10 seconds and it has a strong effect, so I think it can be a bit flashier.

[This is how it looks like] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnljrbQDuRk)

#3. Make allies unable to disjoint allied projectiles.

Currently, projectiles are disjointable regardless of team.  This means an ally can disjoint your Mist Coil, Ethereal Blade and Fortune's End (Oracle's Q).

In my opinion disjointing should be only a beneficial move done to dodge enemy spells, and not allied spells, since disjointing allied spells has no upsides whatsoever. Like, an ally will never attempt to dodge your spell intentionally. They will also not think of the possibility of it happening. So as of now, as Abaddon or Oracle, you have to wait for your ally to use their blink before you can heal them or dispel them, or protect them with e-blade. It can get frustrating sometimes.

Yes, you could prevent this by communicating, but really, even if you play with a 5 stack and open mic, you'll not announce every Mist Coil you cast on your blinkers.

It would be quite benificial for Abaddon and Oracle if this was not a thing.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-crqmWTqs)

---

#4. Make Aphotic Shield able to damage invisible/fogged units

It's a non-targeted aoe effect. Why is it unable to hit invisible units within range? Other spells which had this property (Scream of Pain, Death Pulse, Shukuchi) were changed to affect fogged/invisible units in range. I think Aphotic Shield is the last aoe spell which can't.

---

#5. Borrowed Time heals form Hearstopper Aura and False Promise.

Hearstopper Aura is supposed to be "negative regeneration", but yet it uses pure damage flagged as hp removal.

False Promise is pure flagged as hp removal as well.

Both of them completely bypass any form of damage manipulation.. except for Borrowed Time and Ghostship's rum. They even bypass Borrowed Time's aura. Other hp-removal effects bypass Borrowed Time and Ghostship, but these 2 don't. Armlet's degen, Soul Rip's aoe hp gather thingy, Ghostship's rum wear-off damage, all are hp removal and bypass Borrowed Time and Ghostship's rum.

Funny part is, neither Hearstopper Aura nor False Promise can passively proc Borrowed Time. Because they are flagged as hp removal and the passive-triggering ignores that.

[video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfQPr2t4jdc)

The hp removal flag should be consistant. Heartstopper and False Promise should bypass everything like how other hp removal spells do.

---

#6. Make Borrowed Time ignore 0 damage instances for its passive triggering

Basically, I suggest giving Borrowed Time the Blink Dagger treatment: Do not auto-activate on 0 damage instances. Remember when your blink on TA would get disabled during Refraction? Yea, Borrowed Time auto-activates even when you take physical damage during Guardian Angel, or any damage during False Promise, wasting its cooldown.

Borrowed Time already ignores magical damage while spell immune, but it does not do that when affected by other damage negating effects.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJVVwnD4Mvs)

---

#7. Put some consistancy in Curse of Avernus' behavior on illusions.

Controversal, since it is a strong passive. But inconsistent stuff like this bothers me.

Curse of Avernus: Places the buff on each of the illusion's attacks, but does not place a debuff on attack targets. So it works partially for illusions.

Abaddon is not an illusion hero, so would it be strong to make it fully work for illus? Before 7.00, I'd have say make it not work for them at all, since the attack speed bonus doesn't work for them anyway. But now it does work for them.

[video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB2cyhE817U)

#8.Abaddon does not unsheath his sword upon denying allies

He only shows his sword when an enemy is nearby. So when denying, he attacks the ally without his sword. He should get his sword out when an enemy is nearby and when starting an attack.

[video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD6iWOS0c4c)

---

#9. Abaddon uses his self-deny lines when dying to an enemy Abaddon Mist Coil.

Yes these issues are getting very minor. This is where I stop.

Abaddon has special lines for denying himself with Mist Coil. This is the response rul for it

Response abaddon_DeathIsAbaddonCoilIsEnemyAbaddon

It specifies the dying hero (abaddon_Death), the killing ability (IsAbaddonCoil) and the killing hero (IsEnemyAbaddon). However, it does not specify the alliance. "Is*Ally*Abaddon" would specify it to be an allied Abaddon, and since allied Mist Coils only heal, it automatically limits it to the caster.

Suggestion for Valve: Compendium app for TI8|self.DotA2|~Hey, so I know this probably won't see the light of day since it won't directly bring any money into Valve's pockets, but I still think it's a good idea for several reasons so hear me out.
  
  
  
First of all, I'm not talking about some sort of crazy book-type app or anything too all-encompassing, but since TI started I realized there are a couple of actions I want to perform while watching a stream, or while I'm away from my PC, and I can't unless I start DotA 2 up. They're all actions relating to TI and I feel I shouldn't have to start the game-up to perform them.
  
   
1. **Checking/Setting my fantasy team.** There are a bunch of scenarios where you'd want to interact with your fantasy team while not near or at a PC. You're watching a stream, and you want to check if your team has a player that absolutely slayed or if you forgot to put him in. You want to make that last minute change. You want to see how your team did the previous day during your morning work commute. The player cards are collectibles, they stem from player stickers you used to put in a book (compendium) back in the day. I had those for at least 3 world cups (soccer). Given the nature of the cards, I think it makes sense to give the player an option of viewing his collection at his convenience.
  
  
2. **Live match predictions.** This has been a conversation in the past, but having the possibility of setting match predictions while watching the stream, without having to start up your client, that would be fantastic. Right now I am completely ignoring the predictions (aside from the fact that they're bugged) mainly because I am more comfortable watching the matches on my couch on my TV, rather than slouched over my PC monitor. I know it's not the case for *everyone*, but there must be a sizeable portion of the viewership that feel the same way. It's another quality of life improvement that would give the user more reason to watch and be engaged with the content.
  
  
3. **Checking my compendium level.** This is one that Valve might actually like, because I think it would be actually incredibly convenient if you would be able to view  your compendium level, the rewards, **BUT ALSO** have the possibility to buy/increase your level directly from the app. This will pose some restrictions as I don't think it would be good UX to also recycle/open treasures, but if you're 20 levels away from that sweet baby roshan, then it is proven that mobile drives impulse buys anyway. This doesn't add **THAT** much value for the user, but it's just that marketing/content pushing feature that would financially sustain the others.
  
  
4. **Check schedule, standings, etc. .** This is something that every tournament should have - easy access to the progress of the tournament. If you want to see what matches are next, so you can decide if you want to stay up or go to bed, or you want to check mid-game if EG lost their match (without switching streams), or just check the brackets so you have a better feel of the big picture, you could do that without having to go on reddit or liquipedia, just from the app. 
  
  
  
I know that none of these are *must-haves*, they're just some extra features that would give some, not all users that extra something to feel like they're really valued as customers. There are a lot of examples out there of companion apps for tournaments or events, Blizzard is an excelent example. They have apps for Blizzcon, WCS, WoW. Other conventional sports also offer companion apps. I'm not using them as examples to compell Valve to do this or to say that this is absolutely necessary, just to prove that it's not a novel idea, companies have done it in the past, and there was no BAD press or BAD user sentiment following them.
  
  
Feel free to add your own suggestions, these use-cases are just things I've personally felt I could benefit from.~|suggest esports
Valve for the love of God, Let the community create custom AI for Bots|self.DotA2|~When i started dota 1 nine years ago i had the privilege of practicing with AI Maps which were  amazing in their own regard given the limitations of Warcraft 3 engine. The official AI which was headed by Cloud_Str and PBM was and still is one of the best AIs in the Moba genre (probably better than the current dota2 bot)

This game has a very steep learning curve and it would definitely benefit from custom bot from the community.

Minimap shouldn't be tilted during pick phase|self.DotA2|When you are in the pick phase the minimap is slightly tilted backwards and it can be kinda hard to look at it when you're going to be the one last picking. I think you should also be able to predict enemy lanes even before strategy phase because picking heroes is also part of the strategy and not just dealing with what you already picked.|suggest
Valve, please consider releasing the next year's "Big Update" soon after TI8.. the gameplay gets way too stale and many regular players stop playing.. this affects matchmaking and the rest of us feel like quitting too..|self.DotA2|~Also, the gap between the teaser during TI and the actual patch is just waaaay too long and the hype is literally gone by the time it does release.

Just to clarify, by soon, I mean within a month or 2.. not 3 to 4 months like it is now..

All Draft is sorely needed as a regular game mode|self.DotA2|~We all know what's up, whether it be techies or your personal opinion that current pub meta is unfun, this game mode gives players the option for a way less frustrating, and let's be honest, a more fun game for those who would play it.

### Here's how it would work.

a) A quick, 15, seconds countdown to ban heroes, _after_ which the bans are shown and the drafting proceeds like regular All Pick except some heroes are banned.

b) The bans are anonymous.

c) Every player gets only 1 ban.

d) You can't communicate during the banning period, not with your team or the enemy team. You ban for yourself.

e) If you don't ban a hero, it's just that. You don't actually 
_have_ to ban anything.

f) If, for example, 5 people ban the same hero by accident (remember, they can't communicate during the banning period), that hero is banned and there isn't much else to it.

___

###Points to consider:

1) The picking is more fluid and variable than All Pick - logically, flavor heroes would be banned out more often, shifting the pub meta perpetually, making for more fun games.

2) You personally don't have to play against heroes you don't want to. This one is straightforward and benefits only YOU.

3) Captain's Mode is a pretty shit mode without a party of your own.

4) You don't even have to play it, you're giving more options to those who would want them.

I think Valve should really change the After Party Broadcasting goal.|self.DotA2|~1. Pros and personalities have already spoken: they want to relax and have fun after a week long of working hard and dont have to worry about their public images. Some of them even have flights to catch next morning, why would they go to after party?

2. The after party is latenight West coast hour, July 21st is a Monday too. Its the type of broadcast that not everyone would/could enjoy watching.

3. There are rumors about a 2nd after party being planned, most likely being hosted by twitch like every other events. If people know this one will be broadcasted, they just gona go to the 2nd one anyway.

4. I think there are much more creative features that Valve could give as a stretch goal instead of this broadcasting: extending battle bonus period after TI4, custom map supports, pro players subscriptions, mini games while queueing for matchmaking, bi-weekly automated tournament system with items prize,...

Pick Sequence on ranked games should be 1 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 -1 similar to CM not the currently 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1 to even out the first pick/counter pick advantages.|self.DotA2|~Compulsory required necessary text.


Also, maybe add more bans? 2 per player in which 50% goes through.


Edit*
For those saying to just play CM:

* In CM only 1 player on each team controls the pick and bans
* I won't trust one random stranger to my hero choice specially cause that I usually don't go meta (I also play at SEA)
* In CM you are guaranteed to have 5 bans
* Nobody plays CM or RD at least in  SEA
* CM pick phase is too long
* The more ban's part is also to maybe offset those AFK ones, I have games on which only 1 or 2 is nominated~|suggest

DotA Improvement Ideas 3.0|self.DotA2|~Yes, your first thought was right: My hands itched but my favorite pornsite was unfortunately unavailable .

Two reasons have moved me to create this article on reddit. The first is, that I have the feeling **r/DotA2** is used/read more than the **DotA 2 Developer Forum**, especially from Valves side. * When you report a bug on the Developer Forum, nothing happens. But when you post that bug on reddit, all hell is breaking loose and the bug will be fixed in a wink.*

The second reason is to tell you a story, a story about me: [**Tangos for Twitler**](https://www.gofundme.com/TangosforTwitler)
***
The following article is also published in [**Valve's DotA 2 Developer Forum**](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=172873) *(recommended for better readability).* 

***
##**DotA Reborn Improvement Ideas 3.0**
***

I know that every new update can u-turn the DotA 2 Reborn Beta dramatically, so I dont go into much detail in the matter of layout, design, color etc. I try to shape my suggestion so far, that you can understand them.
***
###**1.0 Settings Menu**
***
**1.1 Advanced Ability and Item Hotkeys _\*implemented\*_**
***
Nowadays you see a lot of pauses in the early stages of the pro games, followed by sentences like: *Pause please, wrong config.*

A lot of players use different hotkeys for different heroes, especially to change between normal cast and quickcast. For example when you play Lion, you want to have your abilities *(Earth Spike, Hex etc.)* and the item Blink Dagger on quickcast in order to react and blink faster. In the next game want to aim with your Meat Hook with Pudge or plant Land Mines with Techies, so you have to switch your hotkeys back to normal cast.

>[Selection button for global and individual Hero Hotkeys.](http://i.imgur.com/QAhmE6U.png)

***
**1.2 Emoticons Settings and Emoticons Wheel**
***
At the moment there are two ways to use emoticons in DotA 2:

+ **_Window:_**  Open a window with icons *(emoticons)* and click on them.
+ **_Chat Code:_** Write a specific chat code such as *:salty:.*

Both will get awkward in the future, if more and more emoticons will be released. The window with icons inside will grow and you have to scroll a lot. Also the Chat Code will get more complicated and unmemorizable for example :dac15_embarrass:. To be honest, nobody uses DotA-Emoticons, but everybody writes Twitch-Emotes *(4Head, BabyRage, BibleThump, EleGiggle, Kappa, Kreygasm, DansGame etc.)*. *- Make DotA-Emoticons easier to use!*

>[Editing the Emoticon Wheel and the Chat Code.](http://i.imgur.com/kH7LUSG.png)

***
>[In-game Emoticon Wheel.](http://i.imgur.com/mJgBqc5.png)

***
###**2.0 Dashboard**
***
The Dashboard with his pattern could get a lot of tweaks in future updates. So there is no reason for recommendation that early.
***
**2.1 Friends**
***
The DotA 2 Reborn Beta Friends Menu is divided into three sections:

* **_IN DOTA_**
* **_ONLINE_**
* **_OFFLINE_**

If you have a lot of friends the current kind of grouping is far to confusing, because people change their nickname and avatar picture once in a while.

In Steam Friends, you can assign tags to your friends to group them together and find them quicker. DotA 2 Reborn Beta should take the whole grouping/tagging system from Steam Friends.

>[Use tags and groups from Steam.](http://i.imgur.com/3bdlN7J.png)

***
**2.2 FEED**
***
The FEED flow could be a problem, if you have a lot active friends in DotA 2. An option for ignoring FEEDS from certain friends may help.

>[A FEED deselect button in your DotA 2 Reborn Beta Friends List.](http://i.imgur.com/QUuQpl3.gif)

***
###**3.0 Player Profile**
***

The player profile is one of the most important parts in DotA 2. It is the only possibility for differentiation and individualization besides in-game item cosmetics. And the main source of income are hats. *- Give catwalk!*
 ***
**3.1 Showcase**
***
The majority want to showcase their customized set and not single items.

>[The button "Equipped" allows to show the hero in-game set instead of a portrait or single item.](http://i.imgur.com/Une5Ios.png)

***
**3.2 Profile Achievements _\*implemented\*_**
***
A lot of people use multiple DotA 2 accounts for various reasons. Nowadays profiles are replaceable, the most thing that matters is MMR. We need to value Player Profiles more and appreciate them with achievements.

>[Example: Achievements for played matches.](http://i.imgur.com/rZF11Ep.png)

***
###**3.3 Play Style**
***
More, more, more diversity *HoooooooooO!*

>[You can choose with a filter which count you want to show.](http://i.imgur.com/J6x6HAb.png)

***
###**3.4 Recent Games**
***
The game filter should have more options for better overview.

>[Several filter options and game type icons.](http://i.imgur.com/sTXyx2y.png)

***
###**4.0 Heroes Menu**
***
The Heroes Menu is pretty much *work in progress.* Big changes are inevitable. But some things seems to be solid enough to mess around with.
 ***
**4.1 Featured Hero Pop-Up _\*implemented\*_**
***
This *feature* feels like commercials that appeared before viewers could watch video clips

>[SAY NO TO FASHION SHOW!](http://i.imgur.com/8z6ehr3.png)

***
**4.2 Hero Grid**
***
Finally a logical hero layout. *- Goodbye confusing hero release order! Goodbye nostalgic and useless DotA 1 Radiant/Dire hero formation! I dont miss you!*

>[Added attributes icons and a glow effect *(main attribute color)* behind the hero portrait.](http://i.imgur.com/l2RdcWA.png)

I would love to see the particle glow effect from the DotA 2 Reborn Beta Your-Game-Is-Ready-Accept-Decline-button behind the hero portrait. In main attribute color of course.

***
**4.3 Wardrobe**
***
In the Wardrobe you can equip your hero only with items you own.

>[Select the weapon slot and browse through your weapons on the bottom right.](http://i.imgur.com/JlZEBtn.png)

***
**4.4 Sets**
***
Browse through all sets of the selected hero.

>[You see all single items from the selected set on the bottem.](http://i.imgur.com/oZyQAWV.png)

***
**4.5 Showcase**
***
The option Demo Hero is a bit limited. You can only select between one set or one item you dont have. But the crowd want a *DotA Hattery.* Under Showcase you can create your dream set from all hero specific items that exist.

>[Select the weapon slot and browse through all weapons that exist for that hero.](http://i.imgur.com/Hp6W8b6.png)

***
###**5.0 Watch**
***
Seems like a big placeholder for incoming content.
 
***
**5.1 Event Calendar**
***
I feel I can already say that an event-calendar makes sense. *A serviceable calendar!*

>[The unimpressive DotA 2 calendar.](http://i.imgur.com/FPM0ofk.png)

***
**5.2 Replays - Friend Matches**
***
You should get an information which hero your friend played.

>[The hero of your friend is highlighted with a white frame.](http://i.imgur.com/IsKhmEe.png)

***
**5.3 Replays - Scoreboard**
***
*Give bear more love! The bear needs love! Love the bear! Do it! Do it!*

>[Added inventory slots for Spirit Bear and hide the winner of the match under a reveal-button.](http://i.imgur.com/CAEmVH0.gif)

***
###**6.0 Custom Games**
***
**6.1 Lobby List _\*implemented\*_**
***
A Lobby List button in the navigation bar would be great.

>[Lobby List button in the navigation bar.](http://i.imgur.com/NU4bz3a.png)

***
**6.2 Server Name**
***
Two different names for one server location seems a bit confusing. Even though I can understand the thoughts behind that decision. But at the end we have both player groups *(DotA and Custom Games)* under one umbrella and when they tryout the other game, the perplexity will rise. * One server name for each location (game overlapping)!*

>[Servername dilemma.](http://i.imgur.com/PAHDJ0l.png)

***
**7.0 In-Game**
***

The in-game HUD is currently the same. *- Wait for first concept draft.*

***
**7.1 Hero Models**
***
A couple of heroes require better model execution and texture quality. *- They lack detail, they need love!*
 
>[Warning: The following image contain graphic content that can shock, offend and upset!](http://i.imgur.com/jBKqfvB.jpg)

***
**7.2 Hero Ability Icons**
***
DotA 2 has plenty Hero Ability Icon relicts from olden times. A lot of them are irreproducible. *- The worst is, they are ugly! Please resume your work and refresh them!*

>[Great graphical improvement examples from past by enthusiastic mango eating household knights.](http://i.imgur.com/QLnmQSh.gif)
***
>[*Hunky-dory work, but don't go to the land of nod. Keep it rolling.*](http://i.imgur.com/30J5jfB.gif)

***
**7.3 Loading _\*partially implemented\*_**
***
 
Instead of enjoying the loading screen, we could enjoy the mini profiles of all players too. *- Farewell boring loading time!*

>[Current DotA 2 Reborn Beta Loading.](http://i.imgur.com/fY9znnH.png)
***
>[Suggested DotA 2 Reborn Beta Loading.](http://i.imgur.com/9ZulZGD.png)

***
**7.4 Shop Panel**
***
The item arrangement in the shop panel is pretty much willy-nilly. Newer players took irreparable brain damage through the confusing information overload. They are still bedazzled today, scarred for life and all they wanted were boots, just boots

Sooner or later the in-game HUD will get retread, so here is a little story Ive got to tell, about a noob you know so well:

*Alfredo was a bear, he wanted boots, I swear.
All he had to do, was clicking on the filter button called shoe.*

>[Shop Panel with filter buttons.](http://i.imgur.com/8VTQVzk.png)

***
**7.5 Animated Portraits**
***
From an outside perspective, this section may be the most unimportant of all, but sometimes its the little things in DotA 2 that make me happy.

In other words I *talk to the tree, make friends with it.*  Bob Ross

Because *theres nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.*  Bob Ross


**Open letter from me to Mr. Tree:**

We are living in the 21st century, we were allowed to go through 5 Internationals and we still have this rushed, without love made portraits.  I want portraits not mug shots!
One of the best-known and wise bush of all time that lived on top of a painter once said: *The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.*  Bob Ross

In the first instance you must keep in mind, that the portraits here have more space to breath. They look even worse and constricted in-game when they are surrounded by the HUD.


**Portraits evolution - from zero to hero:**

If you want something boring, just smack the hero in the middle of the frame. Bloodseeker is a great example of a hero portrait that feels cramped and crowded in the frame.

>[Bloodseeker.](http://i.imgur.com/LXBrrWx.png)

You can avoid this when you leave the right amount of space in front of the hero so that it feels more comfortable.

>[Abbaddon.](http://i.imgur.com/ijPVT63.png)

Abbaddon has more space in front of him, but he looks sad and dishonorable. The solution: *Lower camera angle*. A lower camera angle will create a striking effect and the hero will seem important and heroic.

>[The force is strong _(low-angle shot)_.](http://i.imgur.com/wfZxCUe.png)

We the people look up to our hero Razor! Hail Razor! The lower camera angle is not the reason why we chose Razor here, its because of the space. Space behind the hero creates tension in the portrait.

>[Razor.](http://i.imgur.com/Y3aKS2q.png)

Where space is, there is a backdrop and where the backdrop is, there is a story.
Beastmasters backdrop tells us a story, a story about nature and wood, which Razors with lightning and storm also could.

>[Beastmaster.](http://i.imgur.com/uB6Hhp4.png)

Generally, you should leave enough space above the heros head, but not too much so as to fell lost in the frame.
Lunas portrait does a lot of things right, not all, but enough to be the second best hero portrait. In particular the position of the hero. Luna is placed off-center which adds interest, focus and dynamic.

>[Luna.](http://i.imgur.com/ZRgGcjV.png)

There is only one, one portrait to rule them all or in soft and warm german words: **_MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FULFILLED!_**

>[Undying.](http://i.imgur.com/nr6S6Vv.png)

Undying is turned slightly to the left but the space is on the right. This gives the image some tension and makes you wonder what hes up to, as it adds an air of mystery as well.
Having one shoulder higher than the other looks less stiff. In general, diagonal lines are infinity more interesting and have more flow than straight ones.
Undying has enough space in front and behind him for a comfortable feeling. His backdrop tells a character supporting story and the low-angle shot creates a heroic look.

**Check list:**

* **Diagonal lines are more interesting _(if your hero can not do that pose naturally, just create it with a camera tilt)_**
* **Enough space _(in front, behind, left or right, above head)_**
* **Every backdrop tells a story**
* **Golden ratio**
* **Low-angle shot**
* **Rule of thirds**

>[Undying.](http://i.imgur.com/HRzM1VM.gif)

Yes, there are some exceptions like, Gyrocopter, Io and Techies. They need a different camera angle. But thats it.

>[Portraits in their highest form _art_:](http://i.imgur.com/Xl6x6oh.png)

***
**7.6 Barracks**
***
Every now and than, when you have just enough time to destroy one barracks:

    Attack the meele barracks! ATTACK THE MEELE BARRACKS! No! Stop attacking the range barracks! *PING-PING-PING-PING* - GG we lost .

Much as Id like art. Art is not, when you crap in the living room. A good design is not an end in itself. It should also support the clarity and intuitiveness of the game.
The visual difference between meele and ranged barracks should be better developed.

>[Barracks.](http://i.imgur.com/jy42FrV.png)

**_Suggestions:_**

* **_Meele- and ranged-symbol engraved in the buildings._**
* **_Meele- and ranged-banner on a flagpole at the buildings._**

For the audience, the current layout of the barracks looks not as important as it should be. The barracks dont reflect their in-game importancy via their design, they look ordinary, particularly the dire ones. * New desings, please!*

***
**7.7 Hero Selection UI**
***
I never liked the default Hero Selection UI order. I prefer an alphabetical hero order.

For everybody that cant wait till the release of the new in-game HUD and prefers also an alphabetical hero order, cause logic, here is a quick healthy homemade recipe from my granny (RIP):

**Recipe of Alphabetical Hero Selection UI (All Pick):**

* **Total Time:** 3 min
 * **Preparation:** 2 min
 * **Copy & Paste:** 1 min
* **Yield:** 111 heroes from A to Z
* **Level:** [Luser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luser) friendly

**Ingredients:**

 * **[A-Z.txt](http://s000.tinyupload.com/download.php?file_id=16357342574693131026&t=1635734257469313102699307)**

**Tools:**

* **[DotA 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/570/)** _(required)_
* **Working Potato** _(required)_
* **Monitor** _(recommended) - Easter professionals dont need one._
* **Keyboard** _(recommended)_
* **Mouse** _(recommended)_

###**8.0 Demo Hero**
**_\*Sir devilesk created a nice Sandbox (custom games)\*_**
***
With over 100 different heroes, items and over 400 diverse hero abilities you need a lot of basic knowledge *(experience)* if you want to play DotA properly.

Even so the game got a lot of user-friendly in the recent past in terms of abilities/items/damage-interactions, the next patch with massive changes waits around the corner and catapults you back to square one.

Recently when I want to understand some changes or interactions I catch myself abusing the *Demo Hero Option*, because it is much faster and easier than the whole create-lobby-procedure.

What if can we transform *Demo Hero* with his limitations to a kind of Sandbox with more options? * Lets do it!*

***
**8.1 Map**
***
Extend the Demo-Hero-Map with Creep Camps, Runes and Roshan Pit.

>[Minimap of the Sandbox (advanced Demo-Hero-Map).](http://i.imgur.com/sx77klc.gif)

***
**8.2 Options Menu**
***
If you want to explore some abilities/items/damage-interactions you are forced to use a lot of console commands and here is the rub:

Newer Players that could benefit the most from such an environment in terms of teaching themselves fast and easy basic knowledge of open questions lack the know-how to use console commands. *- More options results in less console commands.*

>[Current Demo-Options-Menu versus an example of a possible Sandbox Menu.](http://i.imgur.com/HeHxBFF.gif)

***
**8.2.1 Hero**
***
You can level the selected hero *(includes enemy hero)* up and down by 1 Level when you click on the proper arrow-button.

The 1- and 25-button brings the selected hero instantly to minimum *(1)* or maximum *(25)* level.

>[Options for the selected hero.](http://i.imgur.com/lPL5nV1.png)

You should be able to buy items for the selected hero when you open the Shop Menu. *- The enemy Piata wants candy too!*

For more clarity the Shop Menu could use a Radiant and Dire layout depending of the selected hero. * Simple color changes like the default donkey courier.*

***
**8.2.2 Enemy**
***
Write a hero name in the search box and let him spawn. The search box should be smart, autocomplete hero names and understand shortcuts *(e.g. AM for Anti-Mage or Furion for Nature's Prophet).*

>[Option for creating enemy heroes.](http://i.imgur.com/E4FKmj2.png)

***
**8.2.3 Creep Camp**
***
If you click on the Medium Creeps-button a random medium creep camp will spawn or you follow the arrow and select a medium creep camp of your choice. The creep camps will automatically stack if you click the buttons more than once.

>[Example of the Creep Camp Menu.](http://i.imgur.com/3rUBv3b.png)

***
**8.2.4 Roshan**
***
The problem with Roshan is that he has no level indicator like normal heroes but gets stronger every 4 minutes. The solution is to show a timestamp instead.

You can level Roshan up and down by 4 minutes when you click on the proper arrow-button.

If you click on the Roshan Kill Timer-button. A count up timer will start when Roshan takes damage and ends when he is dead. If you refresh Roshan, you naturally refresh the timer.

>[Options for Roshan.](http://i.imgur.com/sAJyGdb.png)

***
**8.2.5 Rune**
***
Click on a Rune-button and the rune spawns at the rune spot.

Suggestion for a thematical rework of Chaos Knight's ultimate, Phantasm|self.DotA2|~As of now, there are 2 spells which are basically Manta Style on steroids: Phantasm and Naga's Mirror Image. This suggestion is mainly to make one of them more unique and thematically fitting to the hero.

#If you are just here to see the suggestion, here is a demo

###[Video demo of the suggestion] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqcXOcAksW0)

###[Image demo, with red Phantasm illus and red death poof] (https://i.imgur.com/pW8I9Vc.jpg)

---
---
# For details, continue reading

**Reasons for a change:**

1. It's one of 3 Mirror Image abilities. It has no real unique-ness
2. The ability is based on [the horsemen of the apocalypes] (https://dota2.gamepedia.com/media/dota2.gamepedia.com/6/66/Chaknight_ability_phantasm_02.mp3), so how about making it more thematically fitting
3. Phantasm illus are much more powerful than regular illus, but visually look the same

**Current Phanasm:** **After** a half second, clones of Chaos Knight appear **around Chaos Knight**. The clones appear like regular illusions and are **blue**. CK is invulnerable during the half second.

**Suggested Phantasm:** **Upon cast**, the clones appear from portrals to **Chaos Knight's left and right sides**, so that they stand in a row. The clones are still illusions, but are **red**. CK and the illus are invulnerable for half a second until the portals disappear.

**Optional bonus:** After leaving the portals, CK and his illusions charge forward for half a second (while invulnerable), so that it looks like storm out of the portals. Could be made to charge through cliffs and trees, or use regular pathing/stop upon reaching a cliff/tree.

**Notes:** To change the spell as little as possible, its current mechanics/traits are still present:

* The half-second invulnerability (and hiding) are still applied
* It still disjoints projectiles on cast
* It still applies a basic dispel on cast
* It still resets targeting orders on CK and orders CK to stop
* It still could be made to shuffle the clone's and CK's position (I didn't do this in my version)
* It still could be made to spawn 1/2/3 + 50% chance of +1 clone (I just did 4 on each level)
* The upgrade could be kept as well (although it would be weird, but it already is a weird upgrade anyway)~|suggest

A couple (hopefully) easy changes to the spectating experience that would help a lot with #productionvalue and observing in tournaments this season.|self.DotA2|~With the most hectic tournament season coming up since pretty much ever, I figured it'd be a good time to make a compilation post about problems that *should be* easily fixable when it comes to spectating/observing. So let's take a quick look:

1. Cameraman feature in the lobby is unusable
2. "Hold select hero to follow" doesn't work when spectating
3. Camera randomly zooms in
4. Quick-jumping to a hero via number keys only works without smooth drag in use.

If anyone of you guys knows any workaround/fixes for those let me know, I'd be very grateful for those. If not, hopefully, Valve can fix those.

____

### Cameraman feature (Important for Midas Mode!)

The camera feature is *nearly usable* right now for online tournaments. But the selection is the wrong way around: The caster follows the observer's camera, but the selection (clicked hero, courier, tower, etc) of the observer never is shown to the caster. It's the other way around! 

**This is super important for Midas Mode!** I'd love to be able to remote-observe for Midas Mode, but without the selection propagating it makes no sense at all sadly.

I can't stress this enough. This could enable new observers to come into the scene by observing for online tournaments without doing production and with casters being able to directly view their camera movement! And would improve overall online quality because someone like me could hop in for a game or two with no strings attached.

Of course, I could be totally wrong here and it's very hard to fix this, but everything works, _only_ the selection needs to be swapped. It would be amazing if Valve could fix that. And in case this gets fixed, I'll update my observing guide to explain this in detail how to use it and how it works.

____

### "Hold select hero to follow" doesn't work when spectating

Would be really cool if we could get this working or just get a separate hotkey to follow the currently selected unit. Currently, you have to double click on the hero portrait (ODPixel does this all the time when he casts without observer) and it would be amazing if that could be fixed. It helps a lot with Ember Spirit jump outs, Storm Spirit jump ins, Monkey King movement, etc.

### Camera Zoom-In

A personal pet peeve of mine. Ever since

     dota_camera_zoom_return_to_default_time

is cheat protected, there's no way to disable that and after the 30s, the camera starts to zoom in. This is why sometimes observers (and casters) seem to jiggle up and down all the time. Because the game slowly zooms you in even if you are at the perfect height for that teamfight or skirmish.

There were a bunch of spectator commands made cheat protected a while back and somehow this got the axe, even though it's entirely harmless and _really annoying_ when observing. I think that's the correct convar, but it's a bit hard to test right now.

____

### Hero Quick Jump

Valve implemented the hero quick jump (pressing the number keys to directly select and then jump to a hero) but unfortunately, it doesn't work when the smooth drag button is held (usually mouse 3). Would help a lot to select heroes in teamfights when it's important to use smooth drag over the assisted camera.

____

That's about it! 

Feel free to add anything that is relevant to you personally when spectating games in DotaTV, while we're at it.

Valve, please make balance patches more noticeable within the client (popup maybe) - many people aren't following reddit/blog.dota2.com and don't know what's going on or that anything has changed at all|self.DotA2|In my first two ranked all pick games today, some people didn't know what was going on and asked if this was captain's mode. They also didn't know about the balance changes. One could argue that they could see an update queuing in steam and investigate it's nature to find out about the patch and balance changes, but there are still scenarios where people won't do this, for example if they have auto-updates enabled and they updated without noticing or if they expect it to be some minor patch/economy updates instead of a major balance patch. In any case, I'm sure it would help these players as well as players who know about the patch (so they can be sure their team mates know about major changes) to give more attention to such a big updates within the dota 2 client.|suggest
Valve, please consider redesigning players profile page.|self.DotA2|~I remember my first impression when checking out the brand new Reborn was "cool but the profile page looks so dull and unfinished, they'll probably add some cool stuff soon to brighten it up though." I was so convinced that the hero showcase would be later added with redesigned look and even more features and was looking forward to them, but that only turned into disappointment. 

It's been 2 years, nothing new has been added. Remember when we had colorful and informative profile pages in the old game? Now it's as bland as the blackboard in my statistics class back in high school.

Reborn has taken so many features away from the profile page, which was understandable at first since they introduced a new engine, but why the heck did they just leave it there? However you look at the current profile page, it's a major DOWNGRADE comparing to the old one:

* Profile picture has shrunk substaintially.

* You can no longer leave a status msg next to your name, like "dinner brb"

* Hero showcase completely removed, which was a big part of old profile page and a lot of players really cared about it cuz it's where you can show off your most proud hero or your most amazing crazy cosmetics. They took it away. What occupies almost 40% of the page is now a radar chart for your recent performance which is ~~~~absolutely~~~~ next to useless, and a list of statistics which isn't even accurate to begin with. 

* You can only choose 2 from your solo mmr, party mmr, total matches played, total wins, etc. which were all displayed on one page before. Why? Is my profile page a friggin' trial version??? I understand that some people may not want to expose some of the information, but isn't allowing the player to hide some of them a much better way to do this??? Imagine your facebook can only display 2 of your personal info like name, gender, hometown, school, employment status, relationship status, but not everything simultaneously. Like wtf????? 

**EDIT:** I forgot to mention commends. Yes, commendation is a thing, but I cannot give one to the devs for abandoning the feature. What if you have accumulated a decent amount of commends and you are eager to show it but still want to display how long and how many matches you've played? You get triggered as you realize you can't do that and you upvote this post in a desperate attempt so Valve can hopefully see. Minutes ago I read another post that complained about how getting commended or commending someone else doesn't even feel enjoyable due to how obscure the feature is and nobody cares about it. Having the number of commends you've received directly displayed on your profile page could be a good way to start fixing the problem.

* You can only choose 3 from EVERYTHING to display, and I can't believe they mixed cosmetic items and heroes together. Back then we had a customizable 2X4 grid for item showcasing and 3 automatically generated hero portraits sorted by your highest number of wins. I remember a few years ago someone suggested we get hero portraits with our own equipped cosmetics on the profile page, and people were hyped about it being a possibility in the future. But Valve just made that future inaccessible by removing the feature completely. Why??????? wtf???????? It feels like I'm being punished for having spent a lot of money on cosmetics, cuz I had a lot of items with dope effects and customized names and descriptions (which is another feature that barely exists anymore) and now I can only show 3 of them, and on top of that, while being unable to show which heroes I love to play.

* The status update/comment system that occupies half of the page. Like... it's a new feature alright, but left unfinished. Unable to edit, unable to delete. When I get a rampage or aegis snatch but don't really feel like showing it to everyone, the game just gives me the middle finger as I'm helpless about it. What's even more frustrating is that only you can make a post on your page so your friends can't even leave messages for you which half defeats the purpose of the system already, and you can only write text... like why can't you put a picture up there to show a funny moment of your recent game or something? It feels like my own profile page is actually a rental and I'm not supposed to do what I want.

**and for the love of god Valve please don't introduce compendium rewards that unlock hero showcase and more slots for player profiles. If you do I might get triggered off the face of the planet and die.**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR - The current profile page sucks and deserves new features or at least the old features back.~|suggest

I think I know an aghs upgrade which could make Tiny a lot better than he is right now|self.DotA2|When Tiny gets Aghs, give him a permanent tree, so he doesn't have to use Tree grab to get a tree anymore. Maybe this isn't enough, so I think Tree Grab should be replaced with a new ability called 'Craggy Exterior', but it balances out since he can't use tree toss anymore. Craggy Exterior will have a 25% chance of damaging melee attackers and stunning them, and also gives armor considering he has no agility now. On the topic of armor, he should also get some more agility back, maybe about 9+(0.9 per level). I think this would be a good change to make Tiny stronger since he has such a low winrate right now. I don't think it's overpowered since you need to buy a 4200 gold item to get it. Thoughts?|suggest

Petition to add "Void" as a Faceless Void search string at hero select|self.DotA2|~In hero select, sometimes it takes a while to agree with your team on picks/roles/etc. When that happens, instinct takes over when picking your hero. I don't know how many people have the word "Faceless" pop up in their head before "Void" when talking about the hero. So what I'm proposing here is for Volvo to add "Void" as a search string for him, so that people like me who are forced to find their hero in a split second don't get fucked over by their instincts and pick Venge.

As per /u/nmmgxx's suggestion: also add "322" for Rapira in shop. Ty based Volvo.

/u/AwesomeArab : "Shaman" for Shadow Shaman, "Demon" for Shadow Demon, "Lancer" for Phantom Lancer, "Shaker" for Earthshaker.

/u/AdzR : "Wyvern" for Winter Wyvern.

/u/RapsiSoup : "SF" for Shadow Fiend.

/u/LuisArturo1024 : "LC" for Legion Commander.

/u/stopthatdude : "Rub" should go to Rubick instead of Nyx.

/u/otoninho : "Maiden" for Crystal Maiden.

/u/Sandusson : "Druid" for Lone Druid.

/u/mezz1945 : Maybe add a "search stats" option? Just an idea for the future :)

/u/vimescarrot : Captain's Mode strings replacement with All Pick ones (if you have the time). He also posted examples of some of the issues.

Dear Valve, the lack of a Social Construct in Dota2 is making me slowly stop playing, plz help|self.DotA2|~I dont want to stop playing dota... but I am a social creature. 
I dont want to play alone, I dont want to only have the option to solo que. I want to play with "friends", like minded people.

I am getting up in the years, and Dota has always been my game, but since there is no in game social construct like a Guild the only people I play with are good steam friends and real life friends.

But people get lifes (read kids) and stop playing, and no one new starts playing, I have tryed but the curve is to hard, people dont want to put the effort into the game.

So my only option is to befriend random people from my pubs and play with them... I have tryed that and it has not worked out...


We need Guilds, in game guild, with in game objective to bind you together. Like guild quest or something similar... plz Valve the game needs this, its such an easy fix for so many of the issues.

Dota2 is without a doubt of my mind the best MOBA out there, I know I have tryed the others (because now my friends are playing them)
Dota2 is the best GAME ! but... its hard... and with no social construct to help you.... 

Plz Valve, I dont want to stop playing, but I feel myself starting to be one of the people that only watches dota but does not play it.


Sorry for the rant and the bad english, but I needed to get this of my chest

Suggestions to Rubick's personality|self.DotA2|~I was playing Rubick the other day, i said something like that: There's none who cannot be mimic" and an idea came to my mind.  Rubick should say other hero's lines. For example, when Rubick steals Pudge's hook, when Rubick uses it he should say: "Look who's comming for dinnah" or "Oy fresssh meat"(we all know rubick speak like that: Dinnah or usually speak a bit slow*Fressh).


Imagine, he kills Invoker and he says one of his lines: You die as you lived: insipid and ignorant. and then laughts at you. or at least if he uses sunstrike Rubick should say the name of the skill when casting it.

One of thing i love of Dota is the voice system, i think it still can be improved(but i still love it, never get tired of it)~|suggest
Can we please get better tree hitboxes?|self.DotA2|~I know that this was already posted several times, but for me this is one of the most annoying things in the game. 


At this moment 2 of the top posts are great tree jukes as a well executed tree juke is something that is amazing to watch. 

However, at this moment tree juking might get really difficult because sometimes it is nearly impossible to click on the tree you want to cut. And if you are using quickcast, you can't even see that you are cutting a different tree than the one your cursor is above. Take a look at these few examples:


* http://sendvid.com/jlz1c0l8  (this one is made by me  sorry for the low quality, but I think the point is more that clear)

* https://gfycat.com/NippyWelllitBandicoot by u/veega 

* http://puu.sh/oY6ZE/ae8e54b740.jpg by u/marlan_ 

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QqJ0Oo-yAQ by u/jaspermyyyy



I think it is clear that the tree hitboxes are far from being perfect, fixing them would make the game more enjoyable and hopefully we'd see even more tree jukes such as the Zai's one.

EDIT: Thank you whoever at Valve reacted to this post and tried to improve the hitboxes. I can't check how much of an improvement it is at the moment, but just seeing them acting so quickly makes me happy.~|suggest

When I am alone and want to play a custom game but only have limited time, I want to know what's the expected length of your game or at least some range. I also want to know if I my leaving would cause other players to lose the game or whether leaving is not an issue.

I love watching pro DOTA. But ESL, you made it hard me. Here's some honest criticism.|self.DotA2|~I love watching DOTA, especially professional level games. I've been to 2 TIs, watch every major, and most of the minors, but this one is a huge fucking challenge. A lot of people are giving ESL shit for selling out to Facebook. This is actually a shame, because I'm sure the production for the event is stellar (Though I wouldn't know because I've yet to see the official stream) but there is some legitimate criticism buried in all the random hate for Zuckerberg. This is my attempt at giving ESL constructive criticism:

* Lack of advertising. I had no idea where the stream was being hosted. I'm on Facebook daily, but I never saw an ad or any other article that would actually link me to the streams so that I could watch. The only place I've been able to find a stream link is in the stickied Reddit threads, which is fucking laughable. 

*  Awful time zones and complete lack of a schedule. I'm in -6 GMT and I tried to find when the games started. They showed up as starting "13 hours from now" on JoinDota up until the moment that they started. So even if I wanted to watch, I would have had no idea when to tune in. They finally ended up starting at 1 AM or something, late, but doable if I would have been able to prepare myself.

* Awful mobile support. I think I probably speak for a sizable number of people who watch or listen to streams or vods on their smartphone while working. I still don't know if there are vods of yesterday's broadcast because the shit tier Facebook stream is using Flash instead of an HTML5 player that I might be able to watch on my android phone. Meanwhile, I can open the Twitch app and have instant 1080p 60fps streams (or whatever quality really) on my phone hassle-free. 

* Nasty response to secondary streams. Personally, I don't give a shit about you guys using facebook over twitch assuming that I can: Easily find the stream, watch it on my phone, watch it at a reasonable time of day. The secondary streams on twitch have made that at least somewhat possible in a very amateurish way. But, you guys shouldn't be pissy twats to the various twitch streamers because Facebook offered you a pile of money to essentially broadcast over the IPTV streaming equivalent of AM radio.

Hopefully, this reaches the people its meant for because I really do usually enjoy ESL events. But not when they're impossible to find, hard to enjoy because of timezones/limited rebroadcasts, and ultimately just plain difficult to watch. ~|suggest esports
Valve can we have Prime too.|self.DotA2|~I'm sure most or atleast some of you know of Valve's method of making players happier in CS:GO matches, Prime Matchmaking. For those of you who don't it's simple, you attach your phone number, which in most cases are things you don't have several of or don't get new ones too often, to your account and this becomes your "main" you get matches playing with others in Prime and if you get vac banned or something of the sort you can't rejoin Prime Matchmaking. 

Now we all know the vac thing would be next to useless since valve has yet to vac ban people using scripts or hacks, but in the meantime before the ban wave we are waiting for people don't need to play with bot accounts and people who buy them.

What u/slow4flo has said in his comment is what came to mind when I thought of this being added. Account levels are practically useless right now less than commends and putting it to use with something  like this might help. Keep in mind though this is for ranked only, while also isn't a requirement, most bots and scripter accounts don't even bother with unranked from what I know and I'm not even sure Prime in CS GO works for casual so nothing would change there for the most part, so for those I've seen talking about playing mostly unranked wouldn't be affected by even que time. One issue I can think of right now is how botted accounts could probably que with each other easier due to not being prime but this is just an idea that COULD, no guarantees, help with the issues of abusing the ranked system.

Also if u/SirActionSlacks- could think of some crazy idea it would probably be better than anything Volvo could think of.

TL;DR : Valve add prime matchmaking AND VAC BAN PEOPLE ALREADY.

A Plea for Professionalism at TI4, from ESPORTSREP|self.DotA2|~Dear Reddit community,

First of all, I would like to offer a preemptive shoutout to Kaci Aitchison for her amazing hard work and dedication at TI4. Last year the goddess Kaci barely got any recognition for doing her job properly, so I think we, the Reddit community, should change that this year. I encourage all of you to post as many Shoutout threads as possible, to demonstrate our community's never-ending love and affection for such a beautiful woman  she is a fantastic role model for my 9 year old daughter Alexa.

Now, we are in the midst of the largest and most influential event in the history of sports. This is our moment to make a lasting impression on the world at large. We must prove to everyone that Dota is not a video game, but rather a spectator sport featuring world-class professional cyber-athletes. However, as we all know, there are a number of toxic players who do everything in their power to tarnish the professionalism and integrity of Dota. Inspired by a great US senator of the 1950's, I have formed a list of these players, whose unprofessionalism threatens the view of esports in the mainstream eye:

* iceiceice  Last year, iceiceice was uncooperative when interviewed by the goddess Kaci, and Alexa's TI experience was completely soiled by the talk of iceiceice's unprofessional bowel movements. 
* mason  You cannot spell ignoramus without this player's name. It is of course not at all surprising that a North American brute like mason is a blight on the scene, but it is a problem nonetheless. Earlier this year, mason engaged in an act of racism against the African American community by likening the opposing team to apes. In doing so, he is responsible for setting the civil rights movement back at least 40 years.
* Arteezy  Another North American scumbag, whose arrogance and smug superiority threaten to put off mainstream viewers should he happen to be graced by an interview with the goddess Kaci. Interviews at TI4 ABSOLUTELY MUST be scripted like in regular sports in order to get more TV time and publicity. For instance, Richard Sherman's world class professionalism in front of the camera is largely responsible for the success of American football as a spectator sport. We cannot afford to have young hot-headed players like Arteezy saying anything cocky in interviews, or esports are destined to fail.
* EternalEnvy  Having once made an offensive comment to someone in a pub game over a year ago, and more recently having refused to shake Loda's hand at ESL One, EE poses a great threat to the integrity of esports. Moreover, his love for anime is most likely to be frowned upon by the mainstream. His awkwardness might also make Kaci slightly uncomfortable, which is something that must be prevented at all costs.
* Hao  Although I myself speak no Chinese, I heard from someone who also does not speak any Chinese that Hao was cheering for teams other than DK during the group stages. This is easily indisputable proof that Hao is a disgusting racist. In this community, we value professionalism so highly, and try our best to have our eSports community be as professional as possible. These few people like Hao who are blessed by us (the community, the people watching and supporting the teams) to be given the chance to do something they love for a living, can't even get themselves to respect their brothers and help the Dota 2 community's image. It is absolutely appalling.

In order to keep an eye on these players (and others I am sure I have missed, there being too many to keep track of), I have formed the Tydehunter committee, and appointed my daughter Alexa as the head. The Tydehunter committee will be responsible for hunting down the cyber athletes listed above, who attempt to tarnish the good name of esports and Dota 2. The goddess Kaci must not be exposed to insolent behavior on the part of these young hooligans. As a news reporter for a large company, she has probably never experienced anyone being awkward in front of her, which I fear is an enormous risk for her holiness at TI4. Much like Asians, women are delicate creates that we, as Redditors, are sworn to protect. The goddess Kaci especially is a professional lady who must be defended at all costs from the tyranny of these young men.

Thank you.~|suggest esports
