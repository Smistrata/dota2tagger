ESL, this is UNACCEPTABLE|self.DotA2|~ESL is going after everyone streaming the games disregarding valve's statement about playing nice(Already banned MLP and a BTS channel).

Valve should plant a tree for every 1,000,000 trees we destroy in the community challenge!|self.DotA2|~Since we're probably generating millions of Dollars for Valve anyway, they should give something back to us (in form of Battle Pass / Compendium Rewards, which they already are doing) and to our planet. And because Valve is promoting destroying our barky friends (not that stupid little dog you own, I mean trees), they might aswell plant some.  
The **average cost** of planting a tree (according to google) is ~~$140.  
**For five trees**, however, the average cost would be around **$270**. If we take that into account, Valve could easily plant 20,000 trees for mere $1,080,000.  
I'm sure if you plan to plant (heh) that many trees *anywhere* you'll get an even better discount. So that's either more trees or less cost for Valve. In any case, everyone wins.  
Better image for Valve for slightly less money. Better image for Dota and its community. And we planted some trees.~|discuss

Please, Valve, dont get on reddits hook. Stay with your decision at least for some time.|self.DotA2|~I created this post to show that not all of us here on Reddit agree that Valve should allow autoexec again. 

I played dota for 4 years and never even opened the autoexec.cfg in that time. There is no need for that.

Some people are saying that macroses are not giving you advantage over people who dont use it but thats bullshit because you are able to do stuff that other people cant. And it is not you who is smart cause you know how to set up autoexec, its a flaw of the game that allows you to be better at the game without actually doing anything. 


Also, the removing of autoexec can mean that the redesigned UI that was promised to us is in its final stages.


P.S. I think this post will be heavily downvoted but i dont care, i just want to try break the "bring back macroses" circlejerk.

2GD "Yames" Harding Shanghai Drama Megathread|self.DotA2|~Dear /r/all: 
Hey Now! How is your day going? Are you wondering why this is at the top of reddit right now because you are not apart of the DOTA or eSports community? The tl;dr here is that Valve (half life, team fortress, steam valve) just let go a community favorite host/personality for their large DOTA 2 tournament ongoing in Shanghai. People here are upset and confused and looking for answers.  

Okay boys so that was fun for a little bit, however we need to get reddit working again so we are combining these posts into a central location. Sorry.

Dota Plus analysis by an ex-F2P game product manager|self.DotA2|~I worked in F2P games for 6 years, some as a community manager and some as a product manager. I wanted to share my perspective on Dota Plus because I love talking and thinking about this stuff even though I grew to hate exploitative F2P game monetization:

**Pricing and revenue strategy:**

(For purposes of this analysis, I'm ignoring the economy of community market purchases or individual cosmetic purchases and just looking at Battle Pass monetization strategy)

F2P revenue is generally made up of a tiny number of heavy spenders (whales), a small number of medium spenders (dolphins), and a large number of light spenders (minnows). For many F2P games, revenue from those few whales makes up the majority of revenue for a game. 

For Dota, a whale would be someone who maxed out every battle pass, spending hundreds or thousands of dollars a year. A dolphin would probably be someone who bought every Battle Pass, bought the level 75 TI pass, and bought the Battle Pass Bundle but didn't spend money on levels otherwise. A minnow would be someone who buys one or two passes a year with no additional levels. Overall whales and dolphins are getting a great deal on Plus pricing, while minnows are seeing a price increase. Sorry minnows, but revenue from dolphins and whales is usually the vast majority of F2P revenue, so designers are going to be targeting dolphins and whales instead of minnows when planning new features.

(EDIT: I made a quick and dirty google doc for people to play around with example numbers: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SHfVVzfDoMA7V1I4n_KkvM8rWUPcGqNUa0bjuanXapw/edit?usp=sharing

If you click File, "Make a copy", you can edit the variables to roughly simulate in-game purchasing trends to see how much whales can have an impact on revenue.)

This can be exploitative though, and relies on people with addiction problems or other mental issues. This is the root of the whole loot box controversy in games now. As a community manager who spoke to many whales in the games I worked on, I can say for certain that many of them had some serious issues that caused their spending behavior. Watch South Park's "Freemium Isn't Free", everything related to F2P monetization in that episode is sadly very accurate. 

(EDIT: For clarification, I don't believe all whales have addiction problems or mental illnesses. But I do believe that most F2P monetization is created in a way that unfortunately exploits players with these problems. It's usually not a conscious effort on the part of the developer to say "let's target gamblers anonymous members", it's a byproduct of using only data to drive monetization methods and decisions and not caring to understand who is spending and why as long as the money is coming in.)

~~~~Plus is *much* less exploitative because the most you can spend on it is $3.99 per month. No more posts about people with level 9000 Battle Passes who spent thousands to get them!~~~~

(EDIT: One thing I did not consider in this post is the TI prize pool and events. Valve has said Plus is the replacement for Major Battle Passes, so I definitely expect the TI Pass to return this summer for the purposes of generating the prize pool for TI. This will undoubtedly include the typical exploitative gambling mechanics to get the most revenue and the biggest prize pool. The point that remains is that the direction Valve is taking this new monetization feature is definitely less exploitative than their previous efforts and most F2P games.)

One area to watch out for here is whether Valve will add the ability to purchase shards. Right now they can only be earned by completing objectives, which is great for people with gambling issues or similar problems with controlling their spending. 

~~~~For the average player, the Plus experience will also be improved by the removal of additional purchases. With Battle Passes, Valve had a financial incentive to lock away the best rewards at high levels, forcing those additional purchase options and advertisements on players.~~~~ (CORRECTION: Major Battle Passes did not allow level purchases) With Plus, Valve has a financial incentive to make it as fun and useful for every subscriber. 

This model is a lot easier to maintain too: it's easier to keep a current player happy with new heroes, cosmetics, and challenges rather than trying to get new players to start playing. And that leads to my next topic...

**What Plus Means for the Game's Lifecycle**

Dota isn't dead or dying, let's get that out of the way. But it has peaked in popularity. F2P games tend to stick around for a long time after their peak, unless they get completely killed by a new competitor or a sequel.

The typical F2P lifecycle is Acquisition, Monetization, and Retention, in that order:

Acquisition occurs when the game has not peaked in popularity yet, when growing the audience is the most effective way to increase revenue. In this phase the developer is focused on marketing the game to people who haven't played it and trying to get current players to convince their friends to join in. For Dota, one example of this strategy was releasing and heavily marketing the Free to Play movie to get new players interested.

Monetization occurs when new player growth has slowed and increasing spending for the existing audience is the most effective way to increase revenue. If the average player spends $1 on the game and you can increase that average to $2, you just doubled your revenue. The TI Battle Pass is the most successful example of this strategy in action, but you can look back and see Valve's experiments with other strategies like gems, crafting, and chests. These features did not appeal to new players, they were only meant to get existing players to spend more money.

Retention occurs when more players are leaving the game than starting to play the game, so the strategy changes to maintaining existing revenue rather than growing revenue. To do this, developers are going to aim to keep current players as happy as possible while locking them in to consistent spending patterns, sacrificing short-term revenue gains for long-term strategy. 

So it should be clear now that Plus is Valve's strategy for the Retention phase of Dota's lifecycle. Rather than a new feature that gets whales to spend as much as possible in a short time like the TI Battle Pass, Valve is avoiding high but exploitative whale revenue options for a more consistent and longer-term revenue scheme. Offering a discount for 6 month and 12 month subscriptions is part of this strategy: if you buy a 12 month subscription, you're going to be less likely to quit over the next year because you are committed. If you are paying month to month and an interesting new game comes along, you can avoid the negative feeling of financial loss easily by quitting after your current month is up. 

Again, do not interpret this as "Dota is dying". Retention is usually the longest phase of a game's lifecycle (unless it gets replaced by a sequel or killed by a superior competitor), and it can be the most fun and rewarding phase for many players. Instead of trying to maximize spending or new player growth, their goal is to keep us happy and keep us playing. 

The downside is that it's unlikely we will see any huge new features launched after this one. Rather than working on new features, it's likely Valve will focus on improving Plus and supporting the most successful existing features such as new heroes and pro tournaments.

**TL:DR: In its current form, Plus is a much less exploitative monetization feature than the TI Battle Pass and indicates that Valve's current direction with new monetization features is to provide the best experience for current players so they continue playing Dota for years to come.**

(EDIT: If you are interested in the P2W discussion, you can find my thoughts on that in this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/83wx5c/dota_plus_analysis_by_an_exf2p_game_product/dvlxgs7/?context=3)

Thanks for reading everyone, would love to answer any questions and I'll update this post if I got any details wrong due to the newness of this feature. 

(EDIT: Made several corrections related to level purchasing being limited to TI Battle Passes)

DOTA2 has turned into a psychological game where you have to babysit your teammates so they don't tilt morally|self.DotA2|~What the hell has happened with DOTA? It seems that if you are down 5 kills at 10 minutes, you have lost the game, and it's time to feed couriers. It's time to sell your items and just run down mid, we are 5 kills down at 10 minutes, so we are 1k behind or something, we lost! 

Why do I feel like every game I play I have to morally babysit people who are unstable mentally? All they do is cry when someone makes a mistake (in the 5k bracket mind you), blame people, and never own up to their own mistakes.

The change to the report system is definitely to blame I believe. For the past 2-3 weeks I have not gotten a single report back from "Thank you for reporting...". I have only gotten <1> report per week, and I feel like toxicity is completely at it's highest it's been in a VERY long time. 

There is no more threat of low priority, and even if low priority would come, you would just pay $0.4 and play 4-5 games of low prio with some bots and be out of low prio in ~~25 minutes. 

Low priority should DETER people from being toxic/whining crybabies. Reports should have weight to them, so should commends. Commends have been useless since their inception, it's just a worthless stat that doesn't do anything, we get unlimited numbers of those - but things like reports to punish people that ruin games? Yeah, you get ONE a week. 

*Nearly* every single game of DOTA that I seem to play more and more I understand that this game is 75% if not more how you look at the game. If you tilt from minute one cuz you got ganked on mid by two roamers and yell at your team you will play garbage and you will probably lose because you don't do any favours to your team for such a whiny cunt. Try to be nice and not tilt.

For the record, my behaviour score is 8.9k.

TLDR: No more threat of Low Prio, toxicity highest it's ever been, reports do nothing.~|discuss

Legal Analysis of the ESL Genting Situation & DMCA|self.DotA2|~Hey Everyone,

This sub has exploded with anger over the handling of ESL Genting and ESLs decision to issue DMCA takedown notices to a wide array of streams broadcasting the games on Twitch. While some of the public dialogue surrounding these issues shows a good understanding of the underlying legal concepts, the majority of it does not. I figured Id drop in here and make sure everyone has a full grasp of the legal nuances of this situation, as well as to give my own take on how this should/will play out. Before I do, Ill include some quick info on my qualifications/background so you know who I am and why Im in a position to analyze all of this. Feel free to skip that section if you dont care (which, btw, you should because a lot of people are trusting bold statements with little support) or skip all the way to the bottom for the TL;DR if you want to avoid the massive wall of text Im about to write.

**My background**: Ive practiced law since 2013 and own the worlds only law firm that is solely dedicated to esports (www.esglaw.com). My client base includes esports teams, broadcast talent, and esports-focused businesses. I also want to mention that I work with BTSwhile everything Im about to say is my own opinion and does not reflect viewpoints of BTS, the bias here is worth noting as they had a stream taken down as well. FWIW, I also have a number of personal friends working on esports at ESL and Facebook as well, so its not like my biases only flow in one direction. Through my work in this industry, I have dealt with the DMCA on behalf of dozens of clients in a wide array of contexts. If you want a more full bio, [here you go](http://esglaw.com/founder).

**The basics of copyright law**:

Under Title 17 USC  106 of the Copyright Act, copyright holders have the exclusive right to publicly perform the work and to reproduce copies of the work. However, copyright holders can grant licenses to others to use the protected work at the discretion of the copyright holder.

Typical streams include several discrete elements: The game, oral commentary, video showing the face(s) of the player(s), background music or other audio, etc. Its important to separate these elements, because each potentially implicates a separate copyright holder. When it comes to the game itself, the IP rights belong exclusively to games publisher (in this case, Valve)the images, sounds, and underlying code are all wholly owned by Valve and the use of that IP is subject to Valves policies on the subject. This means that Valve could prevent anyone from streaming its game in any context, in its sole and absolute discretion. However, like most game publishers, Valve has chosen to go an entirely different route, and maintains a [blanket policy](http://store.steampowered.com/video_policy) that people are allowed to stream Dota gameplay. Its good advertising, after all.

---

**The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)**:

The rights and obligations of parties under the DMCA are somewhat complex, and have been the subject of [billion-dollar litigation](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viacom_International_Inc._v._YouTube,_Inc.). For our purposes, the most important aspect of the DMCA is the [safe harbor provision](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512), which is intended to shelter service providers from the infringing activities of their users. This provision states that a service provider (such as Twitch) cannot be held liable for copyright infringement on its site if it does not have actual knowledge of the infringement, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent, and, upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove or disable access to the infringing material.

In theory, this provision makes a hell of a lot of sense. There is way too much content published on Twitch, YouTube, etc. for those sites to constantly scour new posts and determine whether or not they infringe on any of the copyrights that exist in the ether. The DMCA shifts the burden of handling the issue to the content creators themselves through the takedown notice system. However, in order to gain the vital liability protection provided by the DMCA, a service provider must act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the infringing material once the copyright holder affirmatively identifies the infringement. 

In short, if Twitch receives a takedown notice that checks all of the boxes, they HAVE to take down the content. On the flip side, the content creator can file a counter takedown notice with Twitch and if that checks all of the boxes, Twitch MUST reinstate the content. The process is well articulated in an [image](https://twitter.com/JustinWong/status/918844085150015488) tweeted by Twitch VP Justin Wong a few months ago.

*With me so far? Ok awesome. Now lets apply your crash course in copyright law to this situation*


**Who is the rights holder?**

It completely depends about which rights youre talking. ESL is producing the event, and they maintain a wide array of copyrights in and to various elements of that broadcast (overlay, shoulder content, casting, etc.). This means that someone could not simply re-broadcast the ESL stream on another platform. However, thats not whats happening here; instead, third parties are simply broadcasting the same gameplay, which is made available through DotaTV, and adding their own casting, etc. on top of that gameplay. Absent some form of contractual agreement on the subject between Valve and ESL [*NOTE: this could exist, though it would be unusual*], the rights in and to the actual gameplay and assets are not ESLs to control. The problem is, Valves stance on the streaming of gameplay from a third party event isnt clear at present


**Valves Role & Statement**:

As noted above, Valves base policy allows all gameplay to be broadcast. However, there is a wrinkle; Valves [October 13, 2017 statement](http://blog.dota2.com/2017/10/broadcasting-dota-2/) tackled the issue of broadcasting gameplay from a tournament organized by a third party. This statement was partially quoted in [ESLs response to the controversy](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7skypn/on_streams_from_esl_genting/). Im going to include the most relevant paragraph below, in full:

>To that end, in addition to the official, fully-produced streams from the tournament organizer itself, we believe that anyone should be able to broadcast a match from DotaTV for their audience. However, we dont think they should do so in a commercial manner or in a way that directly competes with the tournament organizers stream. This means no advertising/branding overlays, and no sponsorships. It also means not using any of the official broadcasts content such as caster audio, camerawork, overlays, interstitial content, and so on. Finally, this is not permission for studios to broadcast each others events. In general, everyone should play nice together, and we think the boundaries should be pretty clear.

**Unfortunately, this statement isnt particularly clear**. It does say that anyone should be able to broadcast a match from DotaTV for their audience, but it also says that such broadcasts cannot be done in a commercial manner OR in a way that directly competes with the tournament organizers stream. Though they provided more context on what qualifies as commercial (no advertising/branding overlays, and no sponsorships), Valve **did not define what they mean by directly competes,** and reasonably minds can undoubtedly differ on that point. The caveat at the end of the statement only further muddies the watersI dont know what qualifies as a studio in Valves eyes, which makes it impossible to tell who is and is not permitted to stream gameplay from another partys event.

Contrary to Valves concluding sentence, the boundaries arent particularly clear. And while I appreciate the fact that theyve begun to tackle the issue, were a long way from having clearly articulated rules that will govern these types of issues and how Valve wants them to be resolved.

---

**Applying the current, vague standard to this dispute**:

While I hope Valve will further clarify its position moving forward, we still have a present dispute to resolve. Lets go party by party.

**Twitch**: Anyone blaming Twitch just doesnt get it. The framework of the DMCA functionally requires Twitch to do exactly what it did in this case. A content provider as massive as Twitch needs the liability shield offered by the DMCA. There is simply too much content on Twitch for it to identify all infringing content that it posted on its sitethe only way for Twitch to avoid liability is to make sure it acts expeditiously to remove or disable access to the infringing material as soon as it is identified by a third party. And while I would like to see the law changed so that a higher bar is set for determining when a claim of infringement is sufficiently valid to result in a takedown, Twitchs actions were the most legally and economically sound option presently available.

**ESL**: On a basic level, I get itthey have a presumptively lucrative deal with Facebook, and it has to be frustrating to see various Twitch channels pulling in significant viewership based solely on the gameplay from their event. I also think the esports community is absurdly short-sighted and ignorant to the various business dynamics that drive the content they love to consume, and should be far more patient as industry leaders strive to strike the proper balance between monetization and fan demands. 

Valve has expressly stated that a third party cannot broadcast content from DotaTV in a way that directly competes with the tournament organizers stream, and ESL is interpreting that language to protect its interests. How reasonable is ESLs interpretation? That requires a case-by-case analysis of each takedown request they issued. My cursory review suggests that some probably fit Valves vague criteria, while others did not. But the core problem here is that the standard itself is vague, leaving room for both sides to be upset because theyre interpreting it through their own, self-interested lens.

With that said, absent some form of agreement between Valve and ESL on this issue (which seems unlikely), ESL doesnt have the legal right to have content removed from Twitch based on alleged infringement of IP rights it doesnt hold. The underlying gameplay made available via DotaTV is owned by Valve, not ESL. I recognize that ESL is simply acting based on its interpretation of Valves statement, but that statement doesnt shift any legal rights from Valve to a tournament organizer; it merely articulates additional principles related to the rights grant made by Valve to stream Dota gameplay. ESL is in a tough position, but from my seat Im not sure Id be filing a bunch of takedown notices to solve the problem.

**Twitch Streamers**: Anyone streaming this type of content needs to make sure they learn the DMCA. If you believe your content was taken down improperly, you have the right to file a counter takedown notice. As has been noted in other threads, you may also have the right to file suit against ESL under 17 U.S.C.  512(f)(1), which establishes civil liability for any party that knowingly materially misrepresents under [the DMCA] that material or activity is infringing. Of course, litigation is extremely expensive and time consuming. Im by no means endorsing this option and think its incredibly unlikely anyone files suit in this case. I just wanted to point out that it exists and add a statutory reference so people can better understand what this does and does not mean; for example, the people saying ESL reps can go to jail for this arent well-grounded in reality.
 
**Valve**: As the rights holder in this instance, Valve has a great deal at stake in the resolution of the issue. While ESL was merely trying to enforce its understanding of Valves position, those takedown claims have the potential to threaten Valves broad and substantial IP rights with respect to the game it publishes. Valve does not want to cede any ownership over their raw gameplay. If they did, they would lose an incredible amount of leverage/control as it relates to the growth and monetization of their game. 

The ball is squarely in Valves court. By far the best way to resolve this dispute and any similar disputes down the road is for Valve to (1) clarify its policy on what is and is not permitted, and (2) enforce that policy. At present, Valve is putting all competition organizers in an impossible position; assuming for the moment that Valves policy was clearly articulated and ESL was correct that the Twitch streams shouldnt have been allowed, only Valve is in a position to actually issue those takedown requests to ensure that everyone follows the rules.

[*SIDE NOTE: There have been some very interesting arguments made that a player's actions can be original/transformative, thereby creating some form of independent IP rights in and to gameplay ([example 1](http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=penn_law_review) and [example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5uo4qk/remember_spectatefaker_now_skt_t1_is_filing_dmcas/ddvkqez/), but these are just theories. There is no court decision on point and I've talked to a handful of 30+ year IP attorneys that see this as a non-starter. Valve owns raw gameplay. Period.]

Reasonable minds can disagree over what policy would be best in this instance. Fans want to consume content on whatever platform and from whatever source they desire, so they will always want the most open policy imaginable. Competition organizers, on the other hand, invest a lot of time and money into their events and dont want their potential monetization undercut by third party broadcasts. Whatever your personal opinion, remember that there are directly competing interests here that may have broader implications for both Dota and the esports industry as a whole. 

---

**TL;DR**: Copyright law is complex. The DMCA required Twitch to take down the streams once properly noticed by ESL, and the streamers can file counter takedown notices that will allow them to put their streams back up if they believe they have the right to stream this content. ESLs DMCA takedown notices likely arent appropriate because they dont own the underlying gameplay, but theyre in a tough position and I think the hate is largely unfair and misses the nuance of the situation. The core problem here is that Valves policy is vague. Valve needs to clarify its position on the streaming of gameplay from a third party event, and then actively enforce that policy so that everyone can have clear expectations surrounding what they can and cannot do, thereby enabling them to make informed business decisions from the outset. Also, copyright law is complex.

Basically they acknowledged its well within legal right to stream the games on Twitch and yet they still disregard Valve's broadcasting policy and went ahead with the takedown

Don't be sucked in by the latest PR statement|self.DotA2|~Edit 3: [Problem solved!](http://blog.dota2.com/2018/01/dotatv-streaming/)

The latest tweet and further "clarifications" from ESL are meaningless, because ESL HAVE NO RIGHTS TO THE DOTATV CONTENT in the first place, so they don't get to set the conditions for streamers. 

These clarifications are PR statements carefully crafted to give the idea that ESL get to decide which streams are acceptable, and therefore which ones they can take down. They may have achieved that so far, but only by abusing the law, not by right. 

Until Valve change their policy, any stream that only uses data from the client is fine, and we don't need pointers from ESL on who they will and will not allow to stream from the client. That's been the case for as long as I've played dota. The idea that ESL can "clarify" something that ISN'T EVEN THEIR POLICY is arrogant and condescending.

The idea that ESL is now "going easy" on streamers because they've realised the error of their ways is a fallacy. They had no rights to terminate non-commercial streams in the first place. However, their post is worded as if they're doing the community a favor by allowing streamers who are already allowed to stream in the first place. 

They're hoping their new attitude will make you forget something crucial: they chose to abuse the DMCA process to shut down streams that weren't breaking the rules.

Edit: In the [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7sw0w5/i_am_ulrich_schulze_here_to_answer_your_questions/) ESL are still stating "We create and produce the content of the tournament, we do have legal agreements with Valve for those tournaments, and we had streams taken down which violated a policy laid out and publicly communicated." Organisers have **never owned the rebroadcasting rights to the games**, only to the content they add. Many people watch their events because they add quality content and use quality platforms, but many people also just watch in DotaTV.

Until Valve tell us differently, streamers like Mike Le Phoenix were punished by a fraudulent use of the DMCA process. The discussion about Facebook and its problems is important, but don't forget that this company chose to break the law to stifle competition because they had a poor offering, and **still won't back down from their position**.

Edit 2: [Tweets like this](https://twitter.com/william_partin/status/956605040256528384) still display a fundamental misunderstanding of the current policy and of why the subreddit is outraged. This isn't about getting content for free, pirating, or being anti-capitalist: VALVE ALLOW RESTREAMS. Anyone commenting, from ESL to the general public, needs to pause for a second and understand that **the current, publicly published policy, from the official rights holder, allows free and open rebroadcasts from DotaTV at any time**. Any kind of journalist worth his salt would try to figure out why this is such a hot button issue that has caused so much outrage.

This man has done the virtual equivalent of putting his fingers in his ears and going "LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU" because he doesn't like the way things are being said. He comes across as very sensitive because he's tired of people being angry and raging. This is a vital discourse that will have ramifications on the game and its audience figures for years to come.

TLDR: If Valve want to change things so that orgs own the games, they can, but they don't right now, and ESL just doesn't get it.~|discussion esports
Every player at TI5 should get paid.|self.DotA2|~At this stage, The International is not just a competition, but almost a celebration of the year in Dota. Teams and fans come from all around the world to watch the games, interact with the personalities, and make new friends.

That's why, I think that each player who makes it into TI, should be given an amount of money. That way, nobody walks away empty-handed. Even the earliest losers are still able to show something for their year of hard work.

And don't say that 'A Free Vacation To Seattle!' is their reward. That doesn't pay rent or buy food.

Imagine if each player, upon making it into TI, got ten thousand dollars. 10k.

50k a team. 16 teams. That is 800000. Eight Hundred-Thousand.
That barely brings the prize pool below 16 million.

Suddenly, nobody is a loser. Everyone is able to pocket something. Crashing out early is never good, but at least it isn't the end of a career, at least it doesn't mean you spent a year working and toiling for nothing.

Alot of these teams don't make big money. SEA scene, NA scene. Tier2ish teams. Ten Thousand can change alot for somebody.

I would love to see this. Let TI be more of a celebration then a cut-throat competition. The winners will still rake in millions, why not spread the wealth and help the Dota2 Esport community just a little bit.~|discuss esports

Now that TI is over and there's a down period, let's seriously discuss Valve's increasingly anti-consumer model for cosmetics and the ongoing slippery slope over the past few years.|self.DotA2|~I feel like this is something to be talked about now rather than next TI. This is a serious talk about the culmination of a business model that's been getting worse for the consumers over the past few years.

Let me start with a disclaimer; Valve has down a bunch of amazing things in the past few years too; there have been tons of awesome new features/cosmetics that are very enjoyable (ie: quests in battle pass, chat wheel sounds, campaign, etc). So when the inevitable 2-3 retards chanting "if you don't like their things, why buy it? vote with your wallet"; it's because Valve bundles everything they do very well with the shit they do poorly. A competent and rational consumer should definitely call out the bad things, especially when they've escalated to this level.

So what bad things am I referring to? Well, if you were here during the whole immortal 3 fiasco, it's fairly obvious that it's the issue of gambling....sort of. Over the past few years, it's pretty obvious that Valve is murdering trading for profits. That's totally fine IMO; good traders will adapt and profit trading isn't and shouldn't be Valve's primary focus anyway. However, lately, they've been pushing it to the point where it's really bad for the average consumer as well.

What they're doing right now is essentially pure gambling, just without the proper odds public or any form of regulation around it. While they've always had a model like this, it's only become a serious problem now because there were always **alternatives** around it. Years back, you had choices. If you wanted to push your luck and try for the "lottery", you could go for it. If you don't like to gamble, you can always get item "x" off the steam market or in trading. However, with the restrictions, now there is no alternative (besides gift trading which is very very risky to any non-experienced trader). For some reason, they think a 1.3 year trading/marketing restriction is somehow at ALL acceptable. Worse yet, there are people defending this, saying it preserves value.+

Since it's far too late for this TI, can we please come together as a community to petition to Valve to make the restrictions at least somewhat reasonable for the next TI? Just make the items tradable/marketable after TI is over to protect your BP level sales....that's pretty reasonable and fair; and above all, it's a realistic wait for people who want the items released but don't want to put hundreds of dollars in to gamble for it. 

Alternatively, if they insist on keeping Gambling as the "only real" way to get the items in any reasonable amount of time, PLEASE PUBLICIZE THE ODDS. I know you like loopholing around the fact that items "don't have value", but anyone in the steam community knows that's full of shit. If gambling is going to be the only realistic way to get the items, at least follow some of the reasonable regulations around it. People forget that there ARE kids playing this game....as a trader I know people who are under 18 and have spent an extra few hundred dollars trying to get the hat they wanted; they were frustrated by not getting the rare drop (mostly golden linas) despite already spending a lot of money and, not fully understanding the sunk cost fallacy, dumped more money in trying to get it(some are level 2000+ and still haven't gotten it, very very frustrated). I REALLY don't think it's ok to exploit these people, especially if they're underage.

Oh and just to be clear, I'm not posting this because I'm mad I didn't get lucky or some shit (Didn't even open my treasures 1 and 2 bar getting the base 6, opened 3's to try to get some 50 levels so i could get to 2000 more cheaply). I'm posting this as I'm very concerned of the slippery slope they're walking in terms of fucking with consumers. Year after year, I post my concerns and year after year people ignore me with stupid shilling until it's closing on  to a breaking point, where the community finally reacted; hopefully people finally pay attention this year before we get a really fucked up scenario at TI8.


+Side Rant: If you actually think this**(Edit:"This" referring to the fact that a 1.3 year market restriction preserves value; suppose i should've been more clear)**, I'm sorry but you're a fucking retard. In a purely demand driven market, if you're somehow delusional enough to think that making your items be worth $0 for 1.3 years, only to be marketable when all hype/interest surrounding them has died, you're part of the problem. Them restricting trade doesn't make the item "more exclusive"....if anything it adds more supply to the market. Previously, one iteration of item "x" could be passed around to many; now anytime someone wants an item, they HAVE to open a new one adding to the supply. It seriously pissed me off when I saw people shilling for valve for this reason.


**TL;DR: Valve's induced "forced" gambling system is bad for consumers; restrictions on trade/marketing make gambling "only option" to get the item. Please make restrictions more realistic or regulate the gambling system more.**

**Edit: Just to be clear, I'm not saying valve is forcing you to buy items...that's a stupid strawman that people are bound to make for some reason without reading. I'm saying that if you WANT to obtain an item, more and more, Valve is making gambling the only option to get it- that's what's not okay to me.**


Final Edit: Alright so basically I fucked up. After taking a night to think about it, I definitely shouldn't have been so abrasive; I'm pretty passionate about the topic and was pretty salty about how cosmetics issues are treated in general over the past few years. I'm not going to delete anything and pussy out but leave it up as a reminder so hopefully I won't be as big of an ass next time.

I woke up again to a lot more comments. Since I don't have the time today to individually address all of them, I think it'll be easier if I just make it more clear overall. 

When it comes to WHY there's the 1.3 year restriction, a lot of you alluded to it in general. Ofc we can only speculate, but I also believe that it's because they want to "protect" the battle-pass purchasers. They don't want people to feel like shit 3 months after the pass, but 1.3 years after the pass (after their next pass has ended) when the markets flood with cheap immortals. In general, I think if this is the case they're greatly overvaluing how forward thinking people in general are. Protecting their pass is fine,but I feel the 1.3 years is still ridiculous.

Also, the key part here is that people THINK that the 1.3 years will increase the value of their items. I've seen many people talk about how having this stuff untradable better protects their purchase's value. They're **wrong** ;I don't know any nicer way to put it. Here's why. Most people think that these restrictions would decrease supply and thus increase the price/value. However, despite me not agreeing it works in Dota 2 hats (the economy has extraneous factors from the base model assumption), supply is largely irrelevant, especially in a long run (multiple months +). From my 6 years experience, Dota 2 is a primarily demand driven economy, possibly from most of its commodities being potentially "infinite in supply" as well as near 0 cost of production. You can shit on the experience or my intellect all you want, but I have more than just my anecdotal evidence. Nearly 99% of all notable items w. very low supply (Ie: Weta exclusives, Golden Baby Roshans, Rainmaker, etc) have all dropped in value, even when you isolate for extraneous factors (ie: duping, benefactors) - the only exceptions I could find to this are betting items (DC hook, Stache, etc) which in general fall into a cyclical increase in value for a different kind of demand. In all these cases, there's strong correlation to complementary factors in all these price drops, leading to my strong belief that demand is the driving factor.

So why is this relevant? Well think of it this way. Selling Ti7 items after Ti7, everyone's interested in the ti7 stuff. Selling ti7 items after ti8, everyone's going to be focused on the ti8 things. Demand by that time will be in general much lower, killing the price. And keep in mind, supply was only "artificially restricted". In my opinion, there'd be a lot more "real supply" once it hits, due to the limitation of recirculation of the items (only way to get it is to get valve to "produce a new one). Anyone who wants data/evidence of this can look at the volumes on the past TI immortals; as the restrictions have increased, the volume on all the base immortals have also increased (not just on the scm, but if the volume tracker is to be believed, in dota in general). It's akin to 40% of what you put in in 3 months or 10% of what you put in in 1.3 years; only plus is that you get to convince yourself it wasn't a bad financial decision in the meantime to not wait.

More-over, there's a very strong opportunity cost in the meantime. And this isn't just an issue for traders; it hits normal consumers too. Lets say you have this golden lina item that would fluctuate between hypothetically 50-100$ through the year, as she becomes popular/not popular. What if during that time, the 2 new arcanas for the new heroes come out and you need to sell the lina immortal to fund it? Well too bad. Tons of profit opportunities OR just general quality of life/interest opportunities are missed with these kinds of restrictions.

So no, your items will **NOT** be worth more because of the restrictions in ANY sense but your feelings. They'll be intrinsically worth less than their historical counter parts in general (isolating from other complementary/patch factors that come along the way) and literally worth nothing until the date expires. 

**HOWEVER*, none of this is directly relevant to my case and point. I don't really know why I wrote those paragraphs. **My main point is I don't want gambling to be the only way to get an item; either introduce an alternative or at the very least regulate it SOMEWHAT(ie: public show odds). The lessening of the trade restrictions was just the first and simplest way of creating said alternative; if they have another way to do it, then I don't really care too much about their removal.**~|discussion

/r/DotA2 is spoiled|self.DotA2|~It saddens me to browse this subreddit anymore. All I see on this subreddit are complaints. Everywhere. Every other thread is a "petition to Valve" or an "Open letter to Valve" or a suggestion stating what the majority of reddit (2k players) want. It really does sadden me.

In the old days, Major bugs were the only things posted to this subreddit, and if Valve fixed that bug, the subreddit would be ecstatic about the fix. Nowadays, we have people making threads about how bad the Christmas event is, or even just typos in descriptions. The amount of hate I see towards Valve is unreal. 

/r/DotA2 has become spoiled. It started with Valve seeing this subreddit and fixing major bugs. Then they started adding suggestions. Now, if EVERY single thing mentioned on this subreddit is not added, everyone BLOWS up. It's like raising a child and giving him candy one night, when he doesn't usually get candy. Now you start giving him candy every Friday night. Now he expects it. If you stop giving him candy on Friday night, the child is gonna throw a temper tantrum. It's annoying. Quit being a child /r/DotA2

/End complaint of complaining-

EDIT: Didn't know this would blow up like it did. Let me clarify a few things. First of all, when I get to work every morning, I always browse the front page of /r/dota2. It used to bring me much joy to look at RTZ highlights and EE clips, but those are seemingly starting to diminish. The front page this morning was literally 75% complaints about frostivus, cosmetics, minor things, etc... You would think with the large amount of pro games nowadays, the front page would be full of highlights and match discussion, or you know... Dota 2.

And yes, I am one of those people who spend thousands on this game. I had a level 2,000 battle pass. But I will never feel so entitled that I can TELL Valve what to do with their game.~|discussion

Could Valve be measuring interest in a standalone RPG based on Dota lore?|self.DotA2|~First off: Valve has a history of measuring interest by just flinging stuff to the wall and seeing what sticks, or using post-leaks (including code hinting at future changes and taking note from potential backlash in the community).

I was thinking about Siltbreaker. Could it be that Valve, or at least the team working on Dota, is toying with the idea of creating a standalone RPG based on Dota lore, and Siltbreaker is their way of measuring interest in something like it?

I mean, there is so much lore that a lot of it can be used for quests.

Hell, they could hire the Torchlight devs to make it for them. They will be done with their new game [probably late this year](http://www.runicgames.com/blog/hob/) and must be looking for a new venture to sink their teeth in. Include a character creator. Have players encounter our heroes as NPC's in te game, with some of them being recruitable. 

I mean, they have the tech. They have the lore. They have the playerbase. And maybe now, they have a measure at how popular such an endeavour would be. Price it for about 15-20 on the market and I'm sure milions of copies will be sold.

Valve might not be making single-player games anymore as it involves so much hoops to go through, but most of the variables in this case are set. They just have to fill them in.

And, seeing as Valve spends most of their time reading reddit anyway, why not upvote this if you like the idea of a standalone Dota RPG.~|discussion

I'm sorry Cr1t|self.DotA2|~Like no, **lemme just get things straight, cr1t did not draft well either game, though we won't know whether those were his executive decisions or the team as a whole goofed hard in strats.  I'm in no way saying that cr1t didn't underpreform as a drafter and perhaps as a player in EG's last 2 matches.**  

The purpose of this post isn't to somehow excuse the drafting goof vs empire.  **It's to send my condolences to cr1t that /r/DotA2 has quickly turned him into a standalone scapegoat for their frustrations with EG's elimination**.

Over the past 6 hours, I have seen almost nothing but undiluted vehement disdain towards cr1t's alleged failures in empire vs EG.  Over the past 6 hours, months upon months, as well as an entire groupstage of cr1ts amazing team play and legendary support action was burned upon the great reddit bonfire of shifting the blame.  

This rabid pitchforking, mainly carried out by people who rooted for EG, or specifically rooted for a certain player on EG, is not a random knee-jerk reaction.  **It's a damn obvious attempt from EG fans to try and create both an internal and external narrative that cr1t is the only reason EG got absolutely destroyed, to stifle any criticism of the team as a whole, specifically the favorite players on that team**.  

How do I know this?  Tell me the one thing that's been exactly as prevalent in the last 6 hours as hate on cr1t.  **Oh yeah, support, excuses, and condolences for arteezy and occasionally other star players on EG.**  It's clear what's happening.  Instead of admitting that a team as a whole failed to perform in any meaningful capacity in that elimination match, it's much easier to try to convince oneself and others that the loss was entire due to some "black sheep" player who dragged the entire team down and must be quickly kicked from the team and burned in effigy, and that their golden boy Artour was again gifted with a shit teammate, and did the best he could.

Why do I have a problem with this?  Here's some hard truth.  **Arteezy did not do the best he could.  No one on EG did the best they could that match.**  While this is obvious to anyone who watched the match through a clear lens, I'll elaborate a bit on the big non-cr1t failure points that shone that game.

Yes, arteezy was given pl against heroes that can counter him.  **However, arteezy was not powerless to veto this choice.  The fact that he didn't request a different carry from his large pool of carries is that he knew damn well he could win as pl in that game**.  This isn't league where any old hero has several rock-paper-scissor counters that completely shuts down any chance of anything.  Ultimately it's coordination and cohesiveness that wins a game, and a player and team who displays those easily overcomes any theoretical counters to his hero from the other side.  Now, can it be said that arteezy proceeded to demonstrate any such coordination in his pl play that game?  Fuck to the no.  While not uncontested, EG provided him a relatively farmable early game which allowed him to accrue some meaningful items.  However, he then proceeded to make his net worth absolutely irrelevant by repeatedly dying to ganks by empire's kill team.  Yes, it's the responsibility of the whole team to prevent such ganks, but a carry who got farm early game but went nowhere with it is still not a carry who played an effective game, and certainly did not do his best.

The second game, arteezy was given an even easier farm situation, and given a hero, terrorblade, which was more than robust enough, if not even resistant, to empire's lineup.  He was given by his team an even more interrupted farming phase during which he dominated the net worth charts.  I couldn't wait to see him throw his net worth around like all terror blades eventually do by turning into spooky form and just melting a few heroes or delete a lane of racks.  **However, in a long game, a lot of which EG spent either at advantage or even, I not once saw terrorblade do anything more meaningful than threaten a tier 3 push, which while not horrible, is far below expectations for a fed arteezy core**.  Arteezy proceeded to flounder for the entire duration of game 2, and eventually his inefficacy allowed him to get outcarried by empire's mirana and sven.

Since this post is all about being fair, **I will note that arteezy wasn't the sole issue either**.  Like I mentioned above, the supporting cast, Zai and Cr1t, as well by extension the rest of the team, also failed in preventing rtz from getting bullied by empire's initiators.  **In fact, both games witnessed an almost comical lack of map sense from EG as a whole**.  Empire ran a hunting party strategy both games, and both games they with ease ambushed key members of EG's lineup and deleted them, even if they were heroes resistant to deletion, like pl or puck.  Whether it's Empire who stepped it up or EG who stepped it down, the result is the same.  **EG got outplayed hard as a whole, beyond any level of variance that can be blamed to poor draft.**  I think a large portion of EG's fanbase does not want to accept this, and this is why such concentrated criticism (like I've seen such levels before maybe once if ever, despite there being A LOT of cases where an individual player was actually at fault more than the team) is being launched specifically at cr1t.  

Now that I've explained myself as much as I care to:

**I'm sorry cr1t.**

**I'm sorry that all of your gargantuan achievements and contributions to your team have evaporated overnight in the kettle of public opinion.**

**I'm sorry that in a time where you need to collect yourself and would (probably) appreciate some confidence from your teammates and fans (the same support that's already been offered to your teammates by this sub), you're finding almost nothing but mudthrowing and demands for your removal.**

**I'm sorry that in addition to the burden you already carry of having not done your part and your best, people are trying to force the burden of an entire team's defeat squarely on your shoulders alone.**

**I'm sorry that reddit, for all its advantages, is so assymetric in its comprehensive thinking, compassion, and rationality, and that you got the proverbial short stick of that assymetry.**


**And finally, I'm sorry to the dissapointed EG fans that understand that blaming cr1t alone for what happened is wrong and immature, and I wish that you guys will get to see EG stand back up from this.**

I doubt cr1t will see this (in fact, I hope not, since to see this he'd have to wade through an ocean of disdain towards him), and as such this is more something I wanted to get off of my chest, my sum reaction to all of the different frustrating bullshit I've seen this past night.

From where I stand, everything I've said would have gone without saying in any sane world, and this is a departure from the tone I usually like to take.  As such, I don't really plan to argue any of these points.  If you seek to somehow justify the pillorying cr1t's received, I really have nothing to say to you other than go right the fuck ahead.

Taking down Dota 2 scam sites, looking for more fake scam sites.|self.DotA2|~Hello, I am xDiglett and I am taking down phishing sites specifically targeting Dota 2 user inventories.

I am looking for more domains where these script kiddies try to steal your full inventory.

These sites are commonly spread across dota2lounge, through steam messages, and sites by bots. 

They think they can get away by hosting their sites on free Russian hosting sites, or other Russian webhosts. But they're not, these russian hosts are actually very helpful in wiping them from their network.

See [here](http://puu.sh/e13Jv/792f81bd1b.png) and [here](http://puu.sh/e13MR/30be72ec2a.png).

Dota Plus DOES NOT contribute that much to help you. Stop this stupid circlejerk|self.DotA2|~Play 2 game with it. I can not tell the different between Torte guide and this one. I mean I played Zeus in Divine 5 bracket against 5 stunner line up and they still tell me to go Kaya and Scepter, the UI is also worse I'd try to turn it off next game 

Literally everything else is almost useless.Unless you are 2-3k, it never going to affect your gameplay at all, and even if you are the help you got is pretty minimal and you can get that by access Dotabuff.

I get it that it's extra advantage but stop exaggerating it by saying it is Pay2Win. That is stupid .

The All Draft game mode: What you should know.|self.DotA2|~*"Oh, it's this thread again"*  /r/dota2, 2015.  
  
**I've been living under a rock, what are you talking about?**  
Recently some people (including myself) started suggesting that the current all pick is not the best option, especially for ranked. Mainly due to the so-called "Flavor of the month" heroes, or heroes, that are arguably stronger or easier to execute in the current patch and that get picked so often it gets annoying. I.e. Void and Tinker in 6.82, Troll and Sniper in 6.83 or Storm and Techies (among other things) in 6.84.  
The idea is to "encourage" people to play other heroes through simply banning some of the most annoying ones.  
For that end, Valve should introduce a new game mode, let's call it **All Draft**. People who play this mode have to ban a hero, removing it from the pool and making it impossible for either the teammates or the enemy to pick it, and then proceed to pick the heroes normally from a reduced hero pool. The rules are yet to be determined in a more exact manner, but the most reasonable variant would be **blind ban**, which prevents both your and enemy team from seeing what hero any particular person banned until the picking phase begins.  
**Ok, but what's the point of blind ban?**  
As already mentioned, compromise is everything.  
1. This means that **up to** 10 heroes are banned every game, in reality some bans will almost always overlap as each person only bans their most hated hero, so **some** flavor of the month heroes will be available to pick anyway. It's alright, the goal is not to just ban as much as possible, it is to improve the game experience for everyone, at least to some extent.  
2. This way, you can also prevent your own teammates from picking a certain hero without them knowing it is you and proceeding to feed because it was their favorite hero or otherwise holding a grudge against you.  
**This is strange. Has this ever been a thing anywhere?**  
Yeah, [Heroes of Newerth](http://hon.gamepedia.com/Game_Modes#Blind_Ban) (another MOBA that used to be quite popular in the days before Dota 2) has it and nobody complained.  
**What if I want to play usual ranked all pick, not this crap?**  
Feel free to. It should be an alternative to ranked all pick, not replacement. Until the test phase is over, at least.  
**If we're gonna have another mode in ranked, an easier one at that, this will make getting mmr easy and devalue it, making rmm pointless in general**  
Some would argue that mmr gained by spamming a single hero *cough*blitz*cough* already doesn't reflect the skill level of the players, and this mode might help change the situation.  
**Who would be the biggest losers if this mode were to become more or less default?**  

* Anyone who "mains" a hero which is considered to be "cancer" or "op", also:  
* Account boosters, picking the same heroes and doing the same stuff every game, in particular  
* Famous personalities/streamers with a well-known preferred hero (RIP Broxy, Sumail and Waga TA marathons)   

**Who's gonna be obvious and potential winners?**  

* YOU  
* That guy  
* People who like to random (ban Meepo @ click random) ^*unconfirmed*   
* People who got mad at a certain hero last game and want to kill it with fire   

**Aren't people who play in parties going to have an unfair advantage by being able to coordinate bans?**  
Could be, but parties generally get to play with and against other parties, so the advantage is mitigated. For a 5-stack this mode could be just a quicker alternative to Captain's Mode, btw.  
**Go play CM, scrub.**  
Go **** urself. People said that concerning the then-new ranked all pick mode with picking in turns, because it also seemed too tryhard and didn't end well for those who always waited for the 5 last seconds to pick their fotm hero. Now the next step for improvement is in line.  
  
I don't have anything else in mind, so please add to the discussion if you will, or tell me where you think I'm wrong.  
Also feel free to copypaste this for ourjust cause.  
**Tl;dr:**

Edit: formatting  
Edit2: The questions raised in this thread  post is 3 hours old.  
**So, my whole team bans 5 counters to my hero and I win?**  
Might happen, but your teammates have their own counters to worry about, so you have to convince them, which is not as easy as it sounds. Also they can pick your hero instead of you if they have the first pick after seeing the bans. Also they can ban 5 counters to some other hero and wreck you instead. There are a lot of factors.  
**What are you talking about? A coordinated team will be able to, surprise, coordinate their bans and wreck an uncoordinated team**  
Did you not read the whole thing? First of all, 5-stacks only play against 5-stacks (establishing proper team communication is up to them), no problem here. Secondly, 4-stacks aren't allowed to queue in ranked, so there's that. Finally, my experience tells me that 2-stacks are more often than not matched with 3-stacks and against 2+3 on the enemy team, so the conditions are equal. You could say that when there are really few people playing on a server in a particular hour then 3-stack + 2 random guys gets matched against a 2-stack and 3 random guys, which favours the first team heavily, but I would argue that already today in rmm during the hours when fewer people play, 6k mmr players get matched with/against 4k mmr, and there goes your disadvantage.  
**What if I want to practice a certain hero and it happens to be a fotm one?**  
Firstly, the ranked all pick does not disappear. The one without bans. Secondly, if All Draft turns out to be a HUGE success and does indeed replace ranked All Pick, you still have the normal AP. That's what you want, "practice", right? Not "grind the only hero I play for mmr"?  
  
Edit 3  the post is 5 hours old.  
**Banning fotm heroes actually prevents you from getting better at Dota 2. Where is my room for improvement? How do I learn to counterpick if I can simply ban?**  
*Youareplayingagainstalliance.txt*  
But seriously, what does that even mean? Is the ultimate goal of Dota to "git gud" or to have fun? Even then, how can you get better if you have to deal with the same stuff game after game? I wouldn't say that learning that Storm Spirit, for example, is countered by silence and then picking Silencer, Skywrath and building Orchid every game shows your high skill.~|discuss

High level pubs are a disaster and inherently promote ruining by any player with ambitions.|self.DotA2|~I want to point out that what I'm about to write mostly concerns the Divine 5 bracket, where most players have the (distant) goal of becoming pro. The fewest players only play for fun. 

I'm top 500 in EU and the environment tilts me before the game even begins. I want you to ask yourself why ruining is so prominent in high mmr. You've seen it from pros and streamers for years and it seems to only get worse. It's not because every Dota player is a self-centered psycho, it's because the system is terrible and is slowing down your progress as well as making the whole experience random and a gigantic trigger.

Pubs have become the primary way to enter the professional scene. They also have always been the primary way to practice and improve. This makes them insanely important and mmr valuable. If the system sucks, it can potentially ruin your career. You can argue the greatest player will always find a way, I argue t2 players also have a right for exposure and to improve over time. 

The way it is right now, alpha personalities have an absolute advantage. If you're willing to fuck over people, you have the biggest gain. There is no deficit in doing it. Maybe you become the victim of a witch hunt, but once you're a t1 player, teams will pick you up regardless. And they should, it's a competitive sport. Think of Noone or CCnC, the 'give me mid or I'm afk' type of players. I don't blame them at all, I admire them. In terms of following their goal of becoming the best player they're doing the right and the smart thing. 

But not everyone is that type of personality. Some players have certain social values and they will try to avoid conflict. That type, however, is going to lose the fight and play core maybe 1/5 games. Why? Because the alpha types simply take the role without asking. The, I'm gonna call him the 'social type', is gonna step down and say to himself, whatever, I'll play core next game. But he probably won't, and he will have so much less practice that he will never ever catch up to people who spam their role every game. And the system doesn't protect these people at all. I'll go as far to say the system promotes ruining for your own advantage. 

This means there really is only one choice. You force yourself to become the alpha type, for the sake of your own career. In a competitive environment, you would have to be stupid to put your own ethics in the way of your success. And this is basically the core of my argument of why the pub system is disastrous. Despite every viewer hating flamers, ruiners, toxic players, they are super prominent at the highest level, simply because it's beneficial. And on the contrary, they burn out the social types and turn them into cynics because the system neither rewards nor protects them in any way. If you're a nice guy, you lose. It's a fact. You can find the proof in every single high level pub. 


I have thought of two solutions for this. 

1. Turn all regional Div 5 brackets into inhouse leagues. Select qualified volunteers to admin them. Establish hard rules. Highest mmr/rank has highest priority to choose his role, lowest picks last. No extreme flaming, pinging, harassing in any way. Only allow one common language. No feeding, afking. If people violate these rules, people can file a detailed report and admins punish them directly, not through the current ticket system. If people file a clowny or false report, they get punished instead. 

2. Role queue. Chill the fuck out people, I'm talking about Div 5 only. Since most people have one or two main roles they want to practice, they should be able to do so. You can select all 5 positions or only one. Don't bind heroes, lanes or items to certain roles, keep it flexible. If 1pos and 2pos want to swap lanes after the picks, they should be able to, as it is right now. If Supports want to swap roles, they should be able to. The purpose of this is simply to bring some structure into the team and not have team mates fight each other because 5 players want to play mid. If you queue with several roles selected, a random one will be selected depending on what the matchmaking can find for you in the shortest time. Create a new report offense, 'refused to play his attributed role'. 
Will cores have longer queue times? Yes, most likely. Is that a bad thing? I know me and my friends are willing to wait as long as 20 minutes if we were ensured to play their roles. On the contrary, this makes supporting/offlaning more rewarding. And it improves the pub experience by preventing ruining.

The character lock is killing new players and having all the characters immediately available was one of the main pros to people starting Dota 2. Valve is moving in the wrong direction.|self.DotA2|The 20 hero lock for 25 games is taking one of the main things that new players had as an advantage over other MOBAs. Dota has every hero immediately accessible for free, but now you are limited to 20 for 25 games which unless you play Turbo (which is not at all a good starting point for Dota) then you are in for a while just to get to the meat. I got an entire friend group of mine who play League and Smite to play Dota with me and they are stuck playing a bunch of heroes that they are not interested in playing. I can swap someone a hero they want, but I am one person and there are four of them. It is one of the biggest detriments to them playing and is the reason 2 people are already almost done trying to play the game since they found more interesting heroes that are beyond the character lock. I should not have to be in this scenario, what exactly is this character lock supposed to stop anyways? New people picking Invoker? Does that really matter in the long run as opposed to making ease of access to new players?|discussion

The DOTA 2 Economy is based on selling cosmetics, why did Valve stop caring about the quality of what we get? Should we even keep suporting it?|self.DotA2|~Back in 2012 and 2013 the game had a healthy and fun economy. It was really cool to open chests, get unusual couriers, read the items' descriptions, we had fun events like Frostivus and Diretide and you could trade and gift cool stuff to your friends anytime. What happened to all of that?

1- Back then, treasure chests were created as a way to introduce single-items from the Workshop artists. One example was the Dark Implements treasure from 2012. This treasure contained, among the items, Lina's Wizard hat, Pudge's Tenderizer, a cool Clinkz bow, and a Mythical Disruptor mount which was a new rare thing back then. You could get duplicates, yes, but if you got an item you didn't want, you could just immediately trade it for the one you wanted so you only had to buy one chest. Valve also used to introduce new different Unusual Courier particle effects to every single new chest they released: Sunfire, Lotus, Crystal Rift, Amanita, Divine, Cursed, Emerald, Rubiline, Diretide Corruption, Frostivus Frost. If you were lucky enough you could get one of these amazing unique couriers. The hero sets were added directly to the store.

What do we have now? Sets are now in chests instead of single items and you can't get duplicates. One may think that's nice except if you get a set you don't want, you can't sell or trade it back until 3 months later when no one will care about it anymore. If you really want a set, you can choose to either spend $15 to get it, or wait 3 months and purchase it for 20 cents instead.

What about couriers? The last time they added a new Unusual effect was on 2013's Diretide. Since then, new chests only have one new courier model, most of the time it can't even be Unusual and if it can, you will get the same old effects over and over they made since 2012. Actually the newer chests don't even include couriers anymore.

Item descriptions? Gone. They're too lazy to write anything to expand the lore through this, like they used to.

Is there any reason to purchase chests? Not in my opinion.

2- Arcanas. I've spend over $300 on Arcanas plus Prismatic gems. One would think you would get a high quality thing, but here's how it goes:

- My Legion Commander arcana used to add lava-like textures to any banner/helmet/armor she used. That feature is gone. The banners now have regular textures.

- I spent $20 to add a Miasmatic Grey Prismatic gem to my Terrorblade Arcana. It doesn't work anymore and the armor's textures aren't shiny anymore even for the default model.

- I spent $55 to add a Champion's Blue Prismatic to my Techies Arcana, plus the $35 from the Arcana itself it's $90. What does it do now? Half of what it used to. The Remote Mines are supposed to have the Prismatic Gem's color. Now they're always green.

- Phantom Assassin's Arcana? A disaster. Those swords left on the ground after killing an enemy hero would block jungle camps. The Critical hit noises could be heard from the fog. The colors couldn't be changed for the longest time, and though most of it was fixed, now the hero model has pink patches all over it from missing textures. $35 well spent.

- Shadow Fiend's? Some of the original particles are gone.

3- Restrictions. Valve claims they do it to fight the credit card frauds but don't fool yourselves. If that's the case, why person-to-person sales such as TI5's secret shop's items also have restrictions? Why can't we trade, gift or purchase anything as we wish anymore? Why does it only happen in DOTA but not in other of Valve's games such as CS:GO?

4- Communication with their customers. Literally non-existant. If you have an issue, go sit and wait for 3 months for an automated copy-pasted response.

5- Events and pay for everything. Remember Frostivus? Me neither. In 2016 they will charge you for equiping and changing hats on your heroes. Want to equip this new Kunkka hat you just got from the new $4 chest? We will charge $1 to equip and $1 if you want to equip a different set. Add particles for $10. Then in three months we will move on to new sets and forget about this Kunkka one, it will get glitches, lose its particles and we won't care about it.

Is there any reason I shouldn't feel like a total retard for giving my money to a greedy company that clearly doesn't care about what they sell anymore?

Edit: found the answer:

> They simply realized we'll purchase any garbage they vomit on us and stopped caring about quality and the consumers' satisfaction.

It's our own fault.~|discuss
With LGD and LFY (LGD subsidiary) both qualifying for T.I, we need to discuss the Admin API Key LGD *still* holds.|self.DotA2|~A few months back, we became privy to the information that LGD - Ruru specifically, had gained an Admin API Key. One of the numerous advantages to having that Key was gaining access to Private Matches - Aka Scrims, that weren't available to the public. This means Drafts, Strats and other *Important* information can be collected and used against the teams who want to practice and perfect their draft and teamwork with specific lineups... 

I shouldn't have to state the absurd advantage you can gain from that information. As the common saying in our community goes, half the match is decided in the draft (for the top level teams).

Now, I'm not privy to the background information for this situation. It might have already been resolved. There hasn't been an update to the situation, thus I'm basing the discussion with the tone that LGD *still* has that Key. If someone can correct me, please do so. 

Now, with *both* teams qualifying, admittedly with a star-studded roster, it still brings into question just how much of an unfair advantage they gained. So far, LGD and LFY were only able to use that information against fellow Chinese teams. They've might have gained two slots for T.I due in-part because of it. 

With T.I coming up however, LGD and LFY might be able to see the Stats, Drafts and *Important* information of *all* T.I teams. Boot-camps are upcoming for all T.I teams. This means hidden Strats and strategies will no longer be effective, in addition to everything else.     

My goal with this post is to bring enough attention to this major potential issue, so those in the know can respond and alleviate my worries, or confirm that it's in-fact an issue Valve needs to address. Other teams attending T.I might also want this potential problem accounted for.

**TLDR; Ruru (and thus LGD and LFY) might still hold an Admin API Key and that gives them an insane advantage for the upcoming T.I and brings into question their wins in the Qualifiers.** 

Edit - Original Post 

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5kwwd6/full_translation_of_lgdruru_scandal/ 

For those saying I'm making accusations... The quote is taken from the link above.

>In 2013, Ruru stole an API-KEY from Steam. The normal API-KEY can only view the data of public matches, however the stolen one was able to view private matches, and this is the reason why VPGAME in early stage can view the results of private matches. Using this API-KEY, under the instruction of Ruru, we build a database system which was able to browse other teams' training results(draft/build), so that we can figure out the opponents' strategies and the way to counter it. Personally, I think all the players who accomplished things are legit, and I don't think any of the players were using those data, I think it is mostly for the stats man in the team.~|discuss esports

Here's the plan for boycotting ESL|self.DotA2|~* For god's sake, don't watch the ESL stream. Not on facebook. Not on their website. Unless you actively support what they're doing, watching while simultaneously hating them is the same as supporting them. They think they can bully us into giving them views - we'll show them they can't herd us like sheep.

* Support twitch streamers. BSJ died for us. And mpl. And maybe some others. And yet more people will no doubt be streaming tonight. Let's show them our appreciation and watch on twitch. Or, watch directly in the Dota game client if you prefer.

* Stream yourself if you can! They can't DMCA all of us. And if they try, well, it's only bigger news and more protesting. Be the hero we need.

* ~~~~Write your congressperson~~~~ Write to ESL. Not like a crazy person who pretends to understand the legal ins and outs of this issue, but like a level-headed human who respectfully wants your voice heard.


Lastly, **Support Dota's origins.**  Dota was a custom mini-game that the players and viewers made into what it is today. Dota is nothing without all of us - they don't get to tell us how and where we watch a game. ESL legally owns the casting and content, but Valve owns the games that you can view in their own client, and they permit streaming on Twitch. ESL does not own the pro players. ESL does not own Dota. Dota is so special because it grew out of the passion of players and fans, and we need to carry that legacy forward to keep the integrity of the game and community. 


Thank you for reading. And if any pro players read this, please consider speaking out. I know a lot of you are in a tournament right now and probably don't want to rock the boat, but you're probably here because you love Dota like the rest of us, and your word would mean a lot.

Why Facebook sucks for Dota 2|self.DotA2|~I tried to support the FB thing.  Here is why it fails:

1. Can't pause videos, instead have to close video or mute.  Can't rewind / go back in vlog like you can under 'Videos' on Twitch
2. Constant weird audio bugs - e.g. randomly 3 different videos will start playing, refresh page only fix
3. Clipping good plays etc requires much more effort ... how do you even do it?
4. When on Facebook, it is not clear how many channels are live.
5. Flicking between the two English channels didn't work a number of times
6. Reduced audience interaction - Twitch chat gives a sense of being in a crowd; FB chat gives a sense of being at a funeral -hide
7. Real names used in FB means many people don't want to interact
8. I don't have a FB account - it keeps telling me to sign up.  I would rather drink raw sewage. Make the popup go away
9. FB has highly invasive and unethical practices re data collection and advertising
10. The core Dota 2 community cannot grow out an eco-system to support dota 2 events on the ESL FB page as well.  There are already several forums and video streaming platforms for this; stop splitting the community up.
11. The Dota 2 Twitch viewer count wont spike as much during these events, lowering overall visibility of Dota 2 to broader Twitch community.

Please consider this for your future events.

Edit update(s): Comments also mentioned stream duration limits; Flash is a problem (ipads, chromecast etc); FB navigation issues; FB stream no mobile support, fullsize video clips edges; Twitch emotes nokappa; VODs flickering; emotes across the video; not working on xbox; following-day spam from FB to email asking for a long-term relationship; replays limited to 720p; browsing FB while video playing leaves video and causes multiple videos to play~|discussion esports
The opinions on Valve on r/DotA2 and r/GlobalOffensive at the moment are so polarizing I can't believe we're talking about the same company.|self.DotA2|~Basically:

- Valve recently announced that CSGO teams now can't have coaches communicating with the team mid-round (only during warmup, halftime, and 4 30-second timeouts). Seems like the entire community is up in arms about it and, judging by their opinion, Valve is a money-greedy company that's deliberately killing the game. Every single significant gameplay update in the last year has been shat on and most of the changes were reverted shortly thereafter.

- Meanwhile in the Dota 2 community, the current patch is widely considered the most balanced of all time (to the point when the next patch isn't as talked about as usual) and Valve is praised for hosting probably the all-around best Dota tournament to date, finally delivering on the Pit Lord reveal and even announcing a new hero outta nowhere.

I mean... damn. ~|discuss esports

Why are people complaining they didn't get what they wanted from GAMBLING and instead didn't support threads asking for everything to be marketable?|self.DotA2|~'Best monetization model'.  

'Gives value and exclusivity to rewards.' (That will sell for 50c ANYWAY next year). 
    
'Not overpriced, comes with all of these bonuses'. (But if you only want  one thing, you gotta pay for the whole lot).    

'If you don't like it go play LoL'. 

'Gambling is a big thing among micro-transactions.' (and yet you're crying now because of it). 

'Something can be better than other options but still not perfect.'

'Valve is not forcing you to buy anything'. 


**Yeah now stfu about not getting what you wanted.**  


2-3 years ago people really did complain about these things, but for the most part, the more recent trend has been to white knight Valve whenever things like this are brought up, and I sure am certain Valve are loving further support instead of expected backlash, which is further enabling them to take from the player-base for their own monetary gain.  

 
Not making immortals marketable helps Valve into baiting people to pay for overpriced levels. You cannot pay for what you want, you have to pay for everything else too, and there is no guarantee of getting the item/s you want. If there was enough backlash from the community, they wouldn't have gotten away with it, but of course, they did because people are still paying for over priced levels under the bait of exclusivity while ironically praising Valve over and over whenever the slightest of criticism appears. 

You reap what you sow; if you supported more of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2ltyy1/let_us_show_valve_that_their_newest_monetization/?st=j55gc8cr&sh=3bb012b9) instead of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6c48ny/daily_reminder_that_dota_2_still_is_the/) you'd maybe be sitting here with a much better Dota 2 than you have now, but you're instead sucking Valve's dick whenever anyone tries to do the former. 


This is also relevant to other parts of the game. That includes cutting support for workshop artists, dropping features like mods, less response to suggetions and bug reports, and more. In fact, you can sense that the quality of the game and Valve's effort has decreased. Of course that's going to happen if you try to repress backlash. Of course that's going to happen if you praise Valve whenever they are criticized. The more you praise and white knight Valve when they're criticized for a certain action, the worse the game gets. Pretty simple. Now stop crying now, you should have helped us when we tried to prevent the game from getting worse. 

Edit: I tried, a lot of you in the comments are just defending Valve without even considering my last point. The upvotes of this post and its comments do not reflect each other. It looks like 82% of you agree, but that's not the case the further I scroll down. Welp. I don't know why you think it's okay that the only purchasing method for the consumer is gambling. And you can only get treasures from paying for over-priced levels. At least some similar threads are popping up now; I'm glad about that. ~|discussion

Performance issue mega thread|self.DotA2|~# **Introduction**

Hey let's give Valve a hand and crowdsource some information for them so maybe we give them an idea where to look for the performance issues. I'm sure I'm not alone with hoping to get this issue fixed rather sooner than later.

Post structure:

1. Possible fixes
2. Instructions how to perform a benchmark
3. Rows upon rows of benchmarks

Please also note that posting your performance is very helpful even if you've felt like you gained a lot of fps in this patch!

Edit1: And as another disclaimer, this isn't meant for in depth testing, simply a broad overview to possibly get an idea of odd outliers. 

Edit2: Loads of results already, thanks guys! Off to sleep, going to update later.

# **Possible fixes**

Section with fixes, working on that right now. **Please post if you have an idea/suggestion that could help**.

## Renderer
Try to run the game with a different render engine. Possible options include:

* -nod3d9ex = The vanilla DirectX9. Might have some effects missing
* -gl = Needs the OpenGL DLC, likely good performance on Nvidia cards (from my testing)
* -dx11 = Successor of DX9, likely good performance on AMD cards (from my testing)
* -vulkan = Needs the Vulkan DLC, was very good for AMD GPUs and low end CPUs before 7.00, now seems to have bugs
* none of the above = standard dx9ex setting, from my testing **currently** the best choice

## Other launch commands
Please remove -high, -threads N or similar launch commands briefly to benchmark. Or if you want to test different ones, feel free to add these options in the **details** section of the table

## Corrupted files of the File System and/or Dota 2
* Start -> cmd -> CTRL SHIFT ENTER, then type: 
* "sfc /scannow" without ". This tests for corrupted files on the Windows System
* "dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth" without ". Similar to sfc /scannow, but repairs the Image Windows has
* Steam -> Dota 2 -> Right click -> Properties -> Verify Integrity of Game Cache, this verifies Dota 2 files

## Shader cache
* For AMD users, turn off shader cache in Crimson via Gaming -> Global Settings -> Shader Cache
* For Nvidia users, disable Shader Cache in Nvidia Control Panel, then take a look into "C:\Windows\Temp\NVIDIA Corporation\NV_Cache" or "C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\NVIDIA Corporation" and delete the files, restart and re-enable shader cache
* Go into "C:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota" and delete the "shaders_xx.vpk" files, then **verify the integrity of the game cache afterwards** or your dota will be visually buggy as hell. **Please re-enable shader cache in your NVCP/Crimson settings!**
* Please note that I don't recommend doing this.

## General stuff

* **Never run vsync on** in Dota2 (or any game which isn't DX12) **if you run windowed/borderless**. Windows' compositor acts as triple-buffered Vsync so you don't need to tick it ingame, you'll have massive input lag else.
* Double check that if running an iGPU (Laptops, most Desktops even nowadays) that Dota runs on your dedicated GPU, this can be done in your drivers control panel

## New Settings in 7.0

* Disabling Grass and moving Trees in Video options yields around a 5% performance boost each, sometimes more
* If you still like grass but don't want to disable it, you can use "r_grass_quality 1", from default of 2. This means there's less grass total. It goes up all the way to 5 if you're crazy for it.

# **How to perform a benchmark**

1. Download the demo file I've made **a while ago** (because recording a demo doesn't work right now [please fix!]) [here](https://gigamove.rz.rwth-aachen.de/download/id/544Km2p5wGfkE3), link is valid for 14 days.
2. Paste the .dem file into your "Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota" folder
3. go in-game and run "timedemo benchvulkan2.dem" 
4. Now the demo should run. **It will look like low fps stuttery mess**, this is **normal**. I can't make a new demo and I think something still is wrong with demos but at least we can benchmark reliably this way.
5. After you're done, take a look into the "Source2Bench.csv" file in the same directory. The last line is the last run of the benchmark.
6. Extract the "FPS" and "FPS Variability" numbers from the last line, [these ones](http://i.imgur.com/I5IBFH4.png).
7. Copy the schema below to fill in your **CPU (note if not stock clocks)**, **GPU (note if not stock clocks)**, **GPU DRIVER**, **WINDOWS VERSION** (WINDOWS KEY + R, type in "winver"), **Renderer**, **Resolution**, **Details**.
8. Post the information in this thread.

_

    copy paste this:
    FPS | FPS Variance | CPU | GPU | GPU DRIVER | Windows Version | Renderer | Resolution | Details
    ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----

so for example a standard run for me would look like:

    Standard run:
    108.7 | 15.4 | 5820k 4.2ghz | GTX 1080 2050mhz/5400mem | 376.33 | Windows 10 1607 | default (dx9ex) | 2560x1440 | All max except shadows on high, no vsync
    ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----

and that looks like:

108.7 | 15.4 | 5820k 4.2ghz | GTX 1080 2050mhz/5400mem | 376.33 | Windows 10 1607 | default (dx9ex) | 2560x1440 | All max except shadows on high, no vsync
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----


Also please note that if you really have more time on your hands check out [/u/aveyo's post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5ixz4w/performance_issue_mega_thread/dbbx1ur/) to generate a vprof log, this will give a better idea which sub routines are responsible for which cpu/gpu times among other things.

Like /u/moartuba pointed out this won't help with specific deep analysis at all, but is meant as a crowd-sourced test to see possible outlier configurations which Valve themselves could then take a closer look at.

It's not possible for people like us to follow multiple channels, search throughout for the best highlight with the commentators we love, and enjoy the game. One channel to rule them all, may it be Minors, Majors, or hell, even the internationals! 

I feel bad for NoobFromUA as well. But rules are rules. Can valve come up with their own channel so that they can update all dota 2 highlights on one channel, or hire NoobFromUA. 

Anyways, thanks a lot NoobFromUA, for all the beautiful highlights! God Speed! 

Edit: NoobFromUA will resume posting highlights with his own caster. Rejoice! ~|discussion esports

Refresher Mana Cost being 375 is not justified with every hero having 20 Intelligence at Level 25|self.DotA2|~It's all in the Title, here are some stats for Heroes with no Inteligence or Manapool increasing items attempting refresh combos at 25.

Faceless Void = 602 mana
300 for chrono, 302 remaining. **63 mana required for Refresh**

Magnus  = 746 mana
300RP +375 Refresh = 81 remaining, not enough for second RP. (1 Mana left if we include skewer) **219 Mana needed for second Reverse Polarity**

Tidehunter - 722 Mana
(325 Ravage + 375 Refresh) 22 mana Remaining
**303 mana required for second Ravage**

Zeus = 1058 Mana
450 TGW +375 Refresh = 233 mana remaining
**217 Mana required for second Thundergod's Wrath**

I hope you are seeing a pattern here; sure this is only calculations involving Level 25 heroes with nothing but a refresher and is completely ignoring the fact that you can buy Int items, but in actual games, there are still regular abilities and item costs to account for. You aren't going to be sitting on high ground waiting for the enemy to allow you to pull off your combo, you are going to be throwing out spells to stop the enemy advance before even thinking about your double ult combo that you may or may not have the mana to pull off.

It seems that the only heroes that reasonably buy Refresher and not ditch it in their inventory after use are Intelligence based heroes who WANT to be buying items to increase their mana pool such as Invoker, Enigma, and Outworld Devourer.

**Every single hero in the game has lost 200 mana coming from 6.88 to 7.00 and most of them can no longer do refresher combos without significant Manapool investment**

Refresher needs to have its Manacost lowered, or have extra mana or Intelligence as part of it's components.~|discuss
I will defend Day9 on this: the on panel is giving him nothing|self.DotA2|This isn't criticism against Day9 or the panel members themselves. It goes against PGL and Valve for their selection of the panel. You got 3 analytical people who just stare at Day9 when he asks an open ended question and he has to be more direct with his questions to get something out of them. If you had someone like a Pyrion or Cap or KOTLguy, someone whose talents extend outside of analysis, they would jump in and help. I know Pyrion and Shane got criticism last year for being on the panel but they contributed and filled in that silence when the others weren't willing to talk. |discuss esports
I'm Sad.|self.DotA2|~Not because 2GD is gone. Not because the majors has been a shitshow. Not because the drama has taken over.

I'm sad because Dota 2 is being driven away from it's community and into the mainstream. If it works, and dota blows up, we can say goodbye to 2GD, OD will probably have to control himself, Slacks will be in a grave marked "Here Lies Community Driven Content". If it doesn't... well I feel like valve will probably keep pushing for mainstream publicity for a long time, getting stricter and stricter, trying to make Dota into a sport rather than an esport.

I don't think esports will be accepted by the mainstream media for a long time. It's simply too complicated, and very hard for someone to watch casually.

People like 2GD appeal to the target audience - teenagers and young adults watching online. Valve are trying to turn dota into a digestible sports show like everything on ESPN, where the target audience is predominantly middle aged men, and I don't think it's going to work.

How can you see Dota fitting in to the public domain?

EDIT: Jesus guys I'm not seeing a psychiatrist over this. In the perspective of the dota scene I'm sad to see it change.

Also, I'm not suggesting everyones getting fired and we're never having a joke on air again, but just remember back to the days where Bruno and 2GD would throw insults at everyone and talk about whatever they want - those days were good. Change can always be a good thing, but it feels like we're now leaving the "good ol' days".~|discuss esports

Dear Valve! Can you pls remove the daily hero bonuses?|self.DotA2|~(Edit: Many ppl dont seem to know this: If you **pick** a bonus hero you get a free mango. This is not about randoming.)

At least **don't** give the heroes a **ingame Advantage.**

If you want to raise the variety of picks you can do something else, maybe:

*higher chance of an item drop
*free item/ chest if you win 10 bonus heroes at 10 days
*bonus hero medal in the profile for 10, 30, 50, 100 bonus hero wins.

but pls move away from actual ingame advantage! thank you!

Hit 5k by spamming Chen. My thoughts on ranked matchmaking and the greatest hero in Dota|self.DotA2|~[The proof](http://i.imgur.com/O6yyoma.png)

I've got a lot I want to talk about, but since most of you will never pick Chen and wont play with one in over 100 games, I'll start with my thoughts on grinding MMR and ranked match making as a whole.

Basically, you kids are too mad. Way too mad. I play the vast majority of my dota matches with IRL friends, so it took me a long time to even calibrate a ranked MMR. I think I calibrated at 3.9K, so I've only had to grind about a thousand mmr to hit 5k. Not really that long of a journey. But on my way, I lost a lot of games due to intentional feeders.

Now, I spam a lot of Chen. With almost a thousand games of Chen played, I'm personally very confident in my ability to play him well. However, I think the real improvement in my MMR is reflecting an attempt to be a better teammate.

I think when I hit about 4.3k, an insane number of my losses were due to like minute 1 feeders. The guys who said "mid or feed" and meant it. Like, 10% of my losses had to have been due to shit like that, and that's totally unacceptable. It actually bummed me out and I quit playing with ranked all together.

A long time ago, maybe in a psychology class or something, I was introduced to the concept of emotional strength. I vaguely remember it coming up in a discussion of child development, but I honestly didnt understand it. What does it mean to be emotionally strong? I wont ever know what it meant in the context of that class, but Dota has me thinking about emotional strength a lot lately. I define emotional strength as **how much mental pressure you can be put under before you break.** For a lot of players, maybe some readers, the answer is that its simply not much. If you play ranked, you understand exactly what I'm talking about.

I'm not sure why these players have such a hard time, but I can understand it. Some people will tell you never to be frustrated when things go poorly or you lose, but in my opinion frustration is a part of caring about the game. In turn, caring is a part of getting good and getting better. How you manifest this frustration is a measure of strength.

The players who choose to lash out at their own team lack strength. You may not like your teammates, but they are your only ones, and they almost always want to win too. Instead, emotionally weak players often are quick to flame their teammates for their mistakes. **Their criticisms are completely deconstructive.** 

If you lose dota games often (and we all lose roughly half of them, don't lie), you probably recognize the pattern. First, everyone is cheery. Then, everyone is quiet (or worse, flaming each other). Finally, your throne is dead. I aimed to break this cycle by communicating better and improving my teams relationships.

Let me be clear: **Forming a cohesive, working team with 4 random strangers is hard, but it is a skill you can leverage to win games.** If you have never put any effort into being a better teammate, you have left MMR on the table. It's as simple as improving at last hitting. It's a fundamental aspect of Dota.

Some tips:

* Do not flame your teammates. Actually, actively defend teammates who are being flamed. 

Toxic players often will flame their teammates. Step in and explain to these players that its okay to make mistakes and that everyone does it, even the best. Explain that this player most likely did not intend to make this mistake, and certainly will try not to in the future. 

* Give *constructive** criticism

Constructive criticism should almost go like this. First, ask your teammate why they made a decision. After listening, provide your alternative view point. Be prepared to learn something from their explanation. Maybe your criticism is totally unnecessary. If you do criticize, explain why, offer an alternative, and be prepared for your teammate to ignore it. If they ignore your advice, try to win anyway. Remember that ultimately each player on the team is making a decision *they* think is most likely to win. Respect that.

"Hey Legion, why are you building BKB?"

"Bane keeps stunning me."

"Bane ult goes through BKB so that's not going to work. Maybe you should switch to a Desolator"

* Be optimistic. See teammates as potential friends, not game ruiners.

* Don't queue up if you arent emotionally in a place to queue

After a rough loss, I'd just go do something else. I am positive it improved my win rate and improved the lives of the people I would have otherwise played with.

* Communicate a plan with your team

As a chen player, I'd often get into some pretty sticky late game situations. I have definitely won games I had no right winning because my team was together on *something.* I've found that your plan doesnt even need to be very good so long as everyone is a single mind on the subject.

* Accept that you will lose

Losing is as much a part of Dota as winning. If you honestly think you are going to win every game you play from now on, I want what you're smoking. Instead,

* Win or lose, ask yourself how you could have played better.

I end each of my games by evaluating myself and coming up with one thing I could improve on. You dont have to watch a replay. It could be as simple as "I should have ganked mid."

**TL;DR** I think too many players focus on individual player skill and not on the social skills required to excel at dota. Focus on being a better teammate and you will see your MMR improve.

**The good part: A Snith Wanabee's Thoughts on Chen:**

After about 1000 games played as Chen, I'd like to think I know what I'm doing. I'm on the dotabuff top 100 for Chen players, though my teammates in ranked have informed me that this is a meaningless achievement. Regardless, its extremely hard to put that many hours into the hero and learn nothing.

*A dog on a skateboard*

Imagine me, an adult man, crawling on top of a skateboard. Then, slowly, carefully, I sit on it as it slides down a driveway. Would you be impressed? Of course not. Now, imagine if instead of myself, I was [A dog](http://www.skaterdog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Home2.png). 

Chen is a dog on a skateboard. Its sort of amazing how differently your team treats you when you do the most mundane shit as Chen. Gank a hero? God. Farm arcane boots? God. Stack two camps? God. Kill a tower? God. Everything you do is made better because youre doing it while playing the dota hero equivalent of QWOP.

I spoke a lot earlier about working to be a better teammate, and being good at Chen honestly does a lot for Morale. Techies spammers get free reports. Chen spammers get free commends. The double standard is real, and I definitely won games by the simple fact that Chen is a huge morale boost for the team.

*Your team loves you*

Other than being able to roll over and play fetch, Chen comes with two spells that your teammates will never get tired of. Hand of God and the [awkwardly named](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/60y7ap/bug_chens_lvl_15_talent_reduces_the_cooldown_of/) Test of Faith. Both of these spells allow you to make ridiculous saves and, like all things Chen, your teammates will greatly overestimate you for them. 

*I'm sold, how do I play Chen?*

Well, start by playing a thousand games.

Okay, okay, but it will take some practice. After 1000 games of Chen, I am still sort of shit at Micro. I play Chen like a hand. Chen is the thumb, and the four creeps are the remaining fingers. My control groups are 1 for Chen, 2 for Creeps only, and 3 for everything. I have four wildkin tornadoes bound to 4 for whenever I have wildkins. If I collect an Alpha Wolf or a Kobold Taskmaster, I just have them follow me. 

One thing I do that I dont see any other Chens do is jungle offlane. I actually always jungle the offlane. I start by my teams secret shop and, around 2min, contest the enemy rune. Contesting the enemy bounty rune with Chen is great because teams only ever send one person to the rune and Chen is the king of early game.

I'm fairly confident that no hero can 1v1 a Chen at level 3, assuming Chen has two creeps. At least, I havent lost a 1v1 yet. I'll keep you posted.

My personal creep tier list goes something like this.

**GOD:**

* Satyr

It gives ring of health in an aura. Wow. and the nuke reaches a ridiculous length and does way too much damage. With arcane boots, you effectively have 100% uptime (its not quite that good but its close). Unlike all creeps, its just plain better in multiples. I have won many games from finding 3-4 of these early on and just nuking my way into their base. Note that its range is similar to Lion's Earth Spike. Target the ground about half way to your target to maximize its range potential

**TOP:**

* Dark-Troll Summoner

Landing a net is extremely easy compared to landing a centaur stomp. Depending on the hero, the net can be as good as stunning as well. Its also worth noting that centaurs are so slow and have such terrible stomp range that landing a stomp often requires a net.

* Centaur

Ah the classic. Many players wrongly assume Centaurs are the god tier best creep, but theyre not. If you see a chen run at you with centaurs, I recommend walking away. Its almost impossible to stomp a hero who is walking directly away from the centaur. Stomp has an extremely short range and the centaurs themselves are quire slow. Other slows/ranged stuns are usually required to land a stun.

**MID:**

* Hellbear Smasher

They give a relevant aura and deal good damage in a fight. Otherwise, not much to say. Suffer from the same range issues as centaurs

* Wildkin

Extremely good as one of the first few creeps you find. They take down stacked camps/the enemy mid laner about as well as any creep you could hope for. The 3 armor aura is also great for pushing

* Alpha Wolf

Significantly better late game than early game, but its one of the best auras you can have. Late game, centaurs explode to randomly shot AoEs in team fights. Creeps that provide Auras are much more powerful at this stage.

**PLAYABLE:**

* Frost Ogre

Frost armor is great. The creep, otherwise, is not.

* Kobold Taskmaster

Never your favorite pickup but the speed aura is extremely relevant for getting your centaurs and smashers in range. And everyone else on your team. 

* Mud Golem

Best used for level one kill strats but has some midgame potential. At level one of Holy Persuasion, you can command a mud golem and, after Holy Persuasion goes off cooldown, command any other creep. Because you have a 1 creep limit, the Mud Golem will instantly die, leaving you with two mini golems. You will maintain command of these golems which allows you to have 3 creeps at level 1. Spicy.

* Satyr Purgeguy

The purgeguy is playable. He's a lot better with helm of the dominator because he has a short cast range and is quite slow. Helm gives him movement speed to make up for that. I end up dominating him a lot less anymore now that Omniknight repel cant be purged.

*Dirty Tips*

Jungle camps cannot spawn the same creep twice. The camp that gave you a centaur one spawn will not give you a centaur the next spawn. If the camp fails to spawn for some reason (like it was blocked), the next spawn can still not be a centaur.

Holy Persuasion trumps all other forms of creep control. Enchantress will be able to take a persuaded creep, but if you persuade it back, the next time enchantress tries to enchant the creep, it will simply reset the duration. She will not re-gain control.  The same is true for Helm of the Dominator. If Naix gains control of a creep and you command it, Naix will not be able to gain control again (and will probably be in your well. Test of Faith him back!). 

The Troll's net goes through Magic immunity and interrupts channels. Juggernaut is a very popular hero and often tries to spin to get away from fights. Nets make him very sad. Storm Spirit cannot ult and AM cannot blink while netted.

*A final note: Fighting Chen*

Pls sirs, stop running into my creeps. Pls.

Actually, here, let me math it out for you. If you see a solo Chen running around in your jungle, count his creeps and add one to that number (Creeps + 1 = X). Then ask yourself "Would I fight an X stacked heavy camp?" If the answer is no, I ask you, why would you fight a camp that big with the brains of a real player behind it? I dont know either, but the number of lvl 1 pudges I've had sit on top of me rotting is way too high at this point. The number of lvl 2 pudges is even higher. I understand you dont see a lot of chen, but I dont think many level two pudges would mess with a hellbear camp. Why would they mess with a hellbear camp that I literally have mind controlled? Food for thought.

For anyone who has made it this far, thank you for reading my 5000 MMR shitpost. I hope it was informative. I cant wait to share my next one at 6k.~|discuss
Valve, just make a model rework contest already.|self.DotA2|~EDIT2: when I suggested the community can vote I meant vote on the various hero model reworks submitted in the contest for a certain hero which is known to have ugly textures, like Slardar, or maybe Valve can choose one. I wasn't suggesting the community votes on which hero gets a rework.

Ok so it's no secret the community wants some of the hero models reworked (myself included). Ugly bastards like Viper, Jakiro and Slardar need immediate help because not even a mother could love those faces (it's been proven with Jakiro). So, Valve, since it seems you're unwilling/too busy to make model reworks yourselves, why not turn it into a contest?

There's tons of talented modders out there who would kill for this opportunity. You could wrap this up in three weeks, tops. Pick a hero and start a contest with three rounds. You can even make it a monthly thing so that for the next months you give us something. Viper, Jakiro and Slardar -> 3 months with new stuff. Here's how the contest could play out:

* 1st week - Model rework submissions for the hero picked for rework that month: everyone can enter their model rework -> people vote for their favourite rework.
* 2nd week - Semi-final: only a few models go forward -> authors fine tune them -> people vote again.
* 3rd week - Final: two models remain -> last minute changes -> community votes on final model

Valve, if you're concerned about your say in this then you could be a model adviser for the finalists, or something like that, or even have a say in the vote as well. That way we can make sure the model is as high-quality as possible, both creatively and technically, and that everyone is pleased. 

So, Valve, what's it going to be?

EDIT: formatting

EDIT3: ok to avoid even more confusion I have to say that I'm not suggesting model changes similar to the legion commander change from dota 1 to dota 2. So I'm not saying that, for example, Slardar should be changed from a fish worm into an unicorn or whatever. I'm saying his texture is ugly and low-res and needs updated. It could turn out that the winning Slardar model rework is not very different from the current one in terms of shapes and idea, but instead just much much better looking.~|discuss
Liquid.gh - Now officially indisputable - absolute GOD among gods.|self.DotA2|~There have been so many stand out performances from so many players this TI, countless next to next-next-level plays. 

But for me, gh undoubtedly takes the cake. He's really come into his own lately, and is consistently performing on a level that reminds me of a jerax, lil, or zfreek (of course among many others, just a few favorites of mine) just cruising on a signature hero, constantly pulling off the seemingly impossible. 

Just so fun to watch, hope to see him in the scene for many years to come.

Here's what I think everyone has ignored about the way Secret played at TI (With Pictures!)|self.DotA2|~I'm not a Secret fan or hater, but as someone who has followed RTZ and EE over the past few years I felt that a lot of the praise/criticism regarding RTZ/EE and PLD/Puppey was a bit unfair. Don't get me wrong, EE had some extremely questionable plays late game, but I disagree those plays were a primary reason they lost. Likewise, despite amazing late game play PLD had an extremely low-impact early game.

**While I don't think anyone will disagree with the fact Secret struggled early, most of the discussion surrounding their loss has been around their late game so I put together a timeline with gifs to illustrate just how bad their early game was.**

## Mid lane first blood
> **0:37** Kunkka reveals the 2v1 midlane by torrenting RTZ. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/OfficialGraciousCockerspaniel)

> **0:52** RTZ gets torrented a second time. Surely a support will rotate for the incoming gank.

> **1:12** Jugg dives Tier 1 and kills RTZ for first blood and fast bottle. RIP

While RTZ could have positioned a bit more defensively, giving him a 2v1 lane as an Alchemist and expecting to win seems a bit optimistic. PLD doesn't rotate mid until 4 minutes when he stacks the mid hard camp for RTZ. Despite SD being able to stack multiple camps, in the first 10 minutes he only stacks twice.

## PLD single pulls EE's lane twice
> **1:35** PLD misses his double pull after only denying one creep. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/FirsthandVagueIslandcanary)

> **2:30** PLD misses his second double pull with no denies. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/DeficientImportantCrocodileskink)

Even though its hard to say exactly how much of an impact those two waves of creep xp made, it definitely didn't help.  PLD essentially gets nothing done for the first few minutes when he could have double stacked and cleared camps with RTZ mid. This is just my opinion, but mechanically speaking, a support playing at main stage missing a double pull twice is just as bad as a carry not hitting his BKB.
## >We Need Wards!
> **3:00** No one notices Kunkka drop off game winning obs ward in Radiant secret shop area, despite being under radiant vision for a full 10 seconds. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/WellwornCalmAfricanmolesnake)

> **3:37** Puppey spots Kunkka leaving, but fails to guess where he warded. Doesn't seem to warn Bulba of incoming gank. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/UntidyWealthyCrossbill)

> **3:42** Bulba finally backs top but its way too late.

> **3:50** Puppey overextends, feeding a double kill to LGD as he chases Kunkka. If he just backs, he gets level 3 from the incoming wave or potentially secures  the 4:00 DD rune top. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/EthicalSevereAxolotl)

This pretty much sets the tone for rest of the game. That single secret shop ward allowed LGD to secure multiple ganks and avoid all of Secret's early game rotations. They had two chances to spot it and missed them both.

Watching Puppey go tunnel vision on Kunkka felt like I was watching a clip of myself, and Bulba taking almost 5 full seconds before turning around actually hurts to watch.

## >We Need Wards!!!!!!!!11
> **4:00** PLD stacks his first and only jungle camp for RTZ's Alchemist. 

>**5:00** Radiant wards have all expired and its night time. Jugg farms mid and runs into radiant jungle.

>**5:05** PLD pings where Jugg is headed and Puppey dies a few seconds later to Omnislash. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/ChiefQualifiedColt)

>**6:16** Bulba gets ganked by hasted Jugg farming the offlane hard camp. Secret still oblivious to dire observer ward.

>**8:30** Jugg gets an Invis which he uses to solo kill Puppey again.

This sums up Secret's early game ward situation in a nutshell. Secret supports lost the ward game to LGD hard. Jugg was able to efficiently gank freely and RTZ was forced to farm super defensively. End result? The only camp Alch feels safe farming is their mid hard camp and and Secret get ganked repeatedly.

## 9k ~~~~Miracle~~~~ Maybe Juggernaut
>**8:49** Jugg escapes a potentially game changing death while Secret further lose their spaghetti. PLD doesn't get his shadow poison stacks off before Blade Fury and wishes he had a point in soul catcher. Bulba drops a boar that attacks twice over using axes and Dota pathing makes him sad. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/CloudyReliableBeaver)

While I admit PLD getting his stacks off before Blade Fury wouldn't have secured the kill by itself, its one of many points in the game where individuals on Secret got outplayed in a potentially game changing moment. For example, Secret could have positioned better for more autoattacks after Disruption or used illusions to bodyblock Jugg after BM roar. 

## Tactical Feed
>**11:09** Puppey gets caught out of position casting Wave of Terror. At this point all I can hope is that these are tactical feeds to burn enemy mana and get higher kill streak gold later on. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/SkeletalAshamedAurochs)

>**11:18** WW casually wards radiant jungle ward spot under Radiant observer vision. No one notices. [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/RapidDesertedBasilisk)

They were so far behind at that point, the death probably didn't matter. Still, its another example of questionable positioning and Secret losing the ward game.

## Even Pros Experience The Trench
>**12:30** Secret pushes their first tower top. Bulba feeds his Hawk to tower getting distracted along with Secret supports chasing a WW hiding in the trees. Meanwhile, 3 LGD heroes rotate completely unscouted without any Secret wards.  [\[Gyfcat\]](https://gfycat.com/FlamboyantUnevenAmericanwirehair)

A popular opinion is that that Secrets supports played well while their cores were underwhelming. **After rewatching the game, PLD/Puppey had as much a hand in Secret's loss as Bulba, Artour, and EE.** The play was so bad, that if you changed the player names, had GrandGrant cast the game, and told me it was NEL, I still wouldn't believe you.

ArtStyle is abusing Stream viewership to report steam accounts.|self.DotA2|~Just tuned in to the http://www.twitch.tv/immunepwnz channel.

So he asks the streamer if he can ask the viewers to report Zeus' steam (around 2.9k viewers at the time). Immunepwnz says sure, this cancerous Zeus needs to be cured and proceeds to spam the link asking to report Zeus (who was just underperforming a little bit).

Why ESL is still delusional and destructive|self.DotA2|~*All the quotes in here are copypasted straight from the AMA, so feel free to ctrl+f them if you want.*

[Recently ESL VP Ulrich Schulze opened up an AMA on this subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7sw0w5/i_am_ulrich_schulze_here_to_answer_your_questions/) In the field of video games, and in this day and age, AMA's are the ultimate PR move. They're basically a consumer venting session that encourages you to be more polite and to sugarcoat your complaints. I can't blame ESL for finally busting out a real PR move, but a quick look at some of the content and answers of that AMA will show that Ulrich and ESL are maintaining their disrespectful and delusional attitude.

Let's begin with Ulrich's introduction. He claims to be apologizing for not "hitting the right tone", explaining that the last two days were a "frustrating situation" for him and ESL. Some tweets have been deleted and some people have been unblocked--and I don't want to conflate the abusive and disrespectful tweets by other Dota personalities with Ulrich--but any tweets about the poor quality of the stream or streaming platform were an invitation to be flamed and blocked, or met with a condescending remark about how the "real world" works (gamers love hearing that, by the way). Some residual effects of this can be seen on [Ulrich's Twitter](https://twitter.com/theflyingdj), notably the desperate attempt to clean up the aftermath of this.

Frankly, if you're a grown adult who's supposedly been working in esports for "15 years", **it is unacceptable to be handling your frustrations by throwing a tantrum on Twitter.** You're Senior VP of an important player in the esports ecosystem, and your response to a business decision not working out how you like is to insult, belittle, and demean your fans? (More on that in a second). Far from "hitting the right tone", you willingly increased the toxicity of the discourse surrounding your own event because...why? Because you made a bad product? Unacceptable response, unacceptable apology. Plain and simple.

But the real meat of this lies in the AMA responses, so let's move on from what we already knew was a huge mistake by ESL.

First, the delusion. In response to a question about why ESL made a deal with Facebook over any other platform, Ulrich answers: **"We believe in the long term value of this because Facebook is a platform which reaches more users than any other platform."** To be clear, this is referring to users that are not already engaged in esports, AKA the other hundreds of millions of users that use Facebook for all sorts of random stuff. Here, the delusion becomes pretty clear. **What was ESL's plan to engage any of those other users who do not care about esports? If, by Ulrich's own admittance, Facebook is not prepared to stream esports events, how could streaming there be any more accessible than a quick redirect to Twitch or YouTube? Why was there literally ZERO intuitive ways to find the stream via Facebook if that's the audience you're trying to engage?** ESL allegedly believes Facebook's huge userbase provides an opportunity for increased viewership, yet they did **nothing** to engage Facebook users who are not yet fans, and actively **discouraged** pre-existing fans from visiting Facebook to watch the stream. It is also worth mentioning that the literal barriers to watching the Facebook stream are monumental compared to Twitch or YouTube. Mobile options are broken or nonexistent. Secondary language streams were nonexistent. Having to have a Facebook account to chat or sometimes even view the stream is yet another barrier to entry. If ESL truly believes Facebook and their actions in promoting this event could ever possibly lead to increased viewership, they are simply **delusional**.

Secondly, Ulrich promptly began lying and backtracking within his own AMA. In response to one question, he clearly states: **"Facebook numbers are not in yet (the number you see does not count users who are not logged in) so have to wait for that"**. However, when another user asks: "Can you confirm that the number shown on Stream is not the actual viewer number, as it doesn't account for users that aren't logged in and viewers from embedded streams?", Ulrich replies: **"I don't know exactly, will find out."** So which is it? Does the display viewership number match the actual viewership number or not? This isn't too important of a point, but it **continues the trend of ESL making unclear, intentionally vague, or flat-out incorrect statements about their Facebook broadcast agreement.**

Oh, remember when I said that the only way Facebook could reach more users than Twitch and YouTube would be if Ulrich was including **people who don't already engage in esports**? Apparently that isn't ESL's goal. Ulrich states: **"I don't think we should ever aim to convert people who have never played Dota or don't know esports exist."** Now, this seems like a pretty horrible mindset for someone who has **"always had [esport's] further growth and success in mind"**, but it also leaves me wondering WHO exactly ESL thinks they are reaching by streaming on Facebook. It's not Dota and esports fans, but it's not people who aren't Dota and esports fans? Huh? Ulrich goes on mention that 4.5 million people "like" Dota 2 on Facebook, and that he believes they could all be potential watchers of a stream. I agree, but then I [look at ESL's unique Twitch channel views](https://socialblade.com/twitch/user/esl_dota2). This one ESL channel has amassed over 36 MILLION unique viewers--a bit more than 4.5 million. I won't even bother accounting for like bots, dead Facebook accounts, the fact that clicking a like button is an entirely different statement than being a "fan" of something, etc. etc. The fact of the matter is that there **was never a specific viewership population ESL genuinely thought would watch on Facebook over Twitch or YouTube.**

If you want any further proof of that, just look at how Ulrich repeatedly handles criticism of the terrible Facebook streaming platform and ESL's complete lack of consideration of their fanbase. I'll provide an image this time, since I think the exchange speaks for itself, and you can find a dozen variations on this awful response throughout the thread: [IMAGE](https://i.imgur.com/1NwkkG4.png)

Now, I could continue ragging on ESL's delusions and total lack of foresight (intentional or unintentional) all day, but the real meat of the matter is their **total disrespect to their fans and the community that allows them to exist.**

The aforementioned Twitter tantrums by Ulrich and other Dota personalities are really evidence enough that those who have "achieved the esports dream" don't give a damn about the community's opinions, and that any criticism of them or their actions will be met with childish whining (ironic, isn't it?). However, what really matters is the **supremely anti-consumer, pro-corporate attitude ESL and others have demonstrated throughout this fiasco.**

Here's the most damning quote from Ulrich himself: **"You are a consumer, but at the same time there is not a direct revenue stream to us from you as a viewer. That means we look at sponsorship potential, broadcast revenue, tickets etc. and based on that make a decision. That means it is not necessarily always the easiest for the viewer, i.e. platforms might change or formats. Unfortunately, that is just the reality of esports right now."**

To translate: we have no plans to consider the fact that behind a broadcast contract or viewership number, there exist REAL PEOPLE who have the power to make decisions about the content they consume. **ESL's expectation is that we consume whatever they produce and then kiss their boots after.** The raw numbers of sponsorship and broadcast contracts are the only things that mean anything to ESL and the only things that ever will. ESL does not care about your counterargument that those sponsorship only exist because **you tune in to watch**. ESL assumes and demands that you will tune in, regardless of how they wrong or offend you. That's the "reality of esports" they have in mind. One where the fans are mindless consumers that amount to nothing but view numbers that **can be manipulated according to their business projections and profit margins.** One where the failures of a product are not the fault of the producers for not producing well, but of the consumers for not consuming what was laid out before them.

If you are a hollow shell that exists only to please your corporate master, maybe that kind of reality appeals to you. But I believe most of us value the ability to express our opinions to the organizations we support, and expect that a **producer's number one goal will always be to make a product that consumers are willing to consume.** They key word here is **willing**, not forced. The absurd DMCA strikes against numerous Twitch accounts (including in languages ESL was not offering) just go to show that ESL wishes for a world where we are forced to consume whatever they produce. We as consumers have been **undervalued, disrespected, and taken for granted.**

There are endless more contradictions (in some responses Ulrich claims the have specific agreements with Valve, in others he claims they have just been interpreting Valve's "vague" blog post) and lies, but I believe I've made my point. If you don't care about the way ESL has treated its fans, and do not care about your options or rights as a consumer, I guess you can go on supporting ESL. But if you want **the ability to choose what you watch** or expect **professionalism and decency** from the companies YOU allow to exist, then do not forget the **lies, disrespect, and arrogance** of ESL in this situation.

can someone please teach me how to win against phantom assassin|self.DotA2|~hello

every game i ban phantom assassin and the ban does not work. the other team then first picks phantom assassin. I try to lane against phantom assassin but she spams me with her dagger for half of my hp for every throw. The dagger costs her 5% of her mana on each throw. If she gets a kill she is level 6 and she instakills me. If she kills 2 people in the game she gets a desolator and can solo rosh and the entirety of my team. If she is able to take any objectives, get any kills, or is not killed at least 10 times in 7 minutes she gets a bkb and instakills my entire team while we run in terror for 10 seconds. I try to save up my money for the 5200 gold necessary to right click her but i have a trouble saving my money when she chases me from my tier 1 into my fountain and kills me while im healing in the fountain cause it misses her. I know that i can buy diffusal blade for 3200 gold so that i can try to right click her for 4 seconds but she just blinks away with her blink ability which has a cooldown of 2 seconds.  I would like to enjoy dota 2 please teach me how to beat phantom assassin

What does a hero trully needs ? [in 7.00]|self.DotA2|~Hey guys, before the wall of text i would like to thank synderen for inspiring this. Since 7.00 launched and the new experience changes were introduced i was keen on understanding what type of hero was going to be stronger. At first i thought that heroes like lina, tusk ,huskar , lion that pretty much max their magic damage output (without ults) at around lvl 9-10 would be super op .


[Synderen's axe game](https://www.twitch.tv/synderen/v/108968749) that starts at around 3.22.00 opened my eyes on why heroes like slark, weaver and ember got huge winrate increases this patch while heroes like lina and tusk have somewhat the same winrate (or worst).

If you look at the [xp chart comparison](https://imgur.com/a/QhDGW#sRjCx0g) you can see that there's a way bigger gap around the lvl 11~~16 than lvl 8~~9  (percentage-wise). If you watch 4 minutes of the Synderen game you can understand why this matters so much (start at 17.30 and go until 21.30) .  They were pretty much in control of the game until a fight starts at 18.00. 

Slark is lvl 14 at this point (in 6.88 he would be lvl 12 and his skill build would be probably 4-4-2-2) . He has the same skill build this game but with the added benefit of having extra 15 dmg from his talent and an extra point on essence shift . They lose that fight (with essence shift stacks that last 1 minute), slark gets lvl 15 and with all that agi (that lasts a lot) he can take the tower and farm really fast guaranteeing slark pretty much a 20 mins silver edge + echo saber. Slark has decent lvl 15 talents but what makes him go out of control in most games is the fact that you can skip them to get lvl 4 essence shift at lvl 15 [skill build for that game](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2863065805/builds), with the same ammount of experience you would be lvl 13 (1 min essence shfits) and in the last patch it would take a decent ammount of time to go from 13 to 14. (There's a HUGE difference between lvl 3 essence shift and lvl 4)

One minute later they fight again in the radiants secret shop and slark obliterates axe again. This time having essence shift stacks that last for 2 minutes guaranteeing another pickoff on him 1 minute later even though synd is still pretty tanky. What's my point here ? 

My point is that if you exclude the heroes with tons of bufs in this patch ( lycan, visage, treant) you will see that a lot of the heroes that got winrate increases this patch have only or mostly ofensive abilities.

 **Examples: Undying, slark, weaver, ember, troll, phoenix,tinker**


[Link for a spreadsheet i made](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TKU6oH3aIY3U172TG6GFtyW3AX__Kzs6wDCtTtryWA4/edit?usp=sharing) I'm using Dotamax as a source [6.88](http://dotamax.com/hero/rate/?time=v688&ladder=y&skill=vh) [7.00](http://dotamax.com/hero/rate/?time=v700&ladder=y&skill=vh). 

Being able to have all your 3 skills at max level and your ult lvl 2 earlier than before helps these heroes achieve a comparable stronger state compared to last patch and thus they snowball. Of course, there are exceptions and even though i can give my two cents on why they are happening my point with this post was never pinpointing one single factor that changed the overal winrate of all heroes, so much stuff changed in this patch that it is probably imposible to do so:

Lina has only ofensive abilities and lost winrate. I feel like she is terrible against monkey king (which has hugh mungus pick rate right now) she is also very bad against a lot of popular heroes: mirana, pa, sniper, weaver,riki, drow.

If you check the spreadsheet though you'll see that tons of heroes with at least one (only)defensive (purification is both) or non-ofensive spells are stale in winrate or lost winrate. 



**EDIT1: Yes i am D2BOWIE**


EDIT2: I know a lot of people are arguing about "selection bias" and everything in life is subjective but i'll try to reitarete my point:

1. Tusk has a slow. it does not deal damage. I know you can use slows ofensively and maybe that's my bad, but i am mainly talking about damage when i refeer to "mostly ofensive heroes". 


**Mostly ofensive heroes > Heroes that can deal damage with every skill they have. (crits, passives like essence shift in my opinnion allow that)**


**Mostly defensive heroes or not all ofensive heroes > Heroes that can not deal damage with every skill they have. (cm aura, tusk slow, warcry , healing ward do not).**

EDIT3: The biggest difference between a hero in this patch and the last patch is that lvl 15 scenario where you max your 3 basic skills way earlier than it would happen in 6.88 . So it doesn't matter if weaver has ult, because she would have lvl 2 ult at that stage of the game. **I am mainly looking at the 3 normal abilities from heroes.**

EDIT4: I have spellcheck, (in portuguese though since i am from Brazil). I am sorry if my writing is not up to par to the usual analytical reddit post. I do try to check some words that  but english is not my first language.~|discuss

Why is Wall of Replica still Dark Seer's ult?|self.DotA2|~Just looking at its stats and comparing to the next closest ability, Terrorblade's Reflection, Wall of Replica is a joke. It's illusions take 400% damage, so they die instantly to almost any AoE, while the illusions created by Reflection are untargetable, have free pathing and will pretty much torment you until they disappear.

Wall illusions also deal 90% damage at level 3, while TB's basic ability, which is easier to set up and land, deal 100% damage.

Oh, but the bullshit is not over yet, cuz when we get into mana costs and cooldowns, Dark Seer has to spend 125/250/375 mana, and put his ability on a 100 second cooldown, while terrorblade laughs at the measly 50 mana he spent, and waits just 16 seconds to cast it again (6 seconds if he goes for the talent, cuz the ability wasn't good enough)

At least Dark Seer's slow is stronger at 75%... Oh, wait, even at its best, it only lasts 1 second, while terrorblade slows you for a third of that, but for 5.5 times as long, but wait, cuz if you went for the cooldown talent, that 25% slow only has a 0.5 second window before TB can reapply it 

The only thing Wall of Replica has over Reflection is being able to control the illusions, and since they last 45 seconds you might be able to do something with them like pushing a tower, but that's assuming they didn't die instantly to a random AoE during the fight, or that people even went through it at some point, something terrorblade doesn't worry about

Tl;dr wall of text about wall of replica~|discussion
Could pro-players please stop being dicks in pub games and therefore help creat a better community?|self.DotA2|~I'm coming from a SC2 background where pro-player behave very friendly in games and i think that is a huge part of why the community is friendly and awesome.
Meanwhile I read on a daily basis about how rtz is flaming in pubs or today how sumail is feeding on purpose for whatever reason and then people crying that the community is so toxic.
Of course it is toxic when such players, who are supposed to be community idols, behave like this.
Schouldn't they behave in the best possible way instead of making people believe that such behaviour is acceptable?
I can't believe that their organisations and sponsors are okay with a behaviour like that as well... It's sad.

Edit: 
I never said I want to compare SC2 to Dota2, I just meant to give an example of a community where I think the pros had a big influence in how people treat each other (and who ever got 6 pooled or canon rushed knows how angry you actually can get in a single player game yet most people just leave the game and don't flame).

Don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying pro-players aren't allowed to rage; I'd never complain about them saying on stream s/t like 'OMG this dude sucks' etc. I mean we shouldn't be okay with them feeding like stupid or telling someone else to die or anything along those lines; I think there is a huge difference.

Edit2:
I'm really not here to discuss whether or not these pro-players should be role models (obviously I don't think they should) but they are and that's the problem. 

Edit3:
Everyone quoting Charles Barkley: "I am not a role model. Just because I dunk a basketball doesn't mean I should raise your kids."

If said Barkley would play a public game everyone would watch on TV and he'd start scoring for the other team, you guys really think people would be okay with that?

Last Edit:
Just because someone once made a commercial that he is not a role model etc. doesn't mean he is right with that...

Otherwise every musician, actor or otherwise famous person could easily have the same point of view.
They don't get paid to be a role model, they get paid to act, perform songs etc. Yet they are role models, whether they like it or not and sometimes you have to accept your responsibility in a community if you like it or not.~|discuss

6.84 has now lasted as long as 6.83. But can we all agree this patch has no where been as bad as that was|self.DotA2|~6.83 was from December - April and 6.84 from April - September (both equally 5 months). And although it's becoming quite stale to see Leshracs and Storms and Bloodseekers in every other game it is no where near to being as annoying as 6.83. Maybe the addition of support friendly items and the toning down of the comeback mechanics has resulted in this.

But I think we can all agree 6.83 was one of the worst patches in Dota history (yes even worse than the Deathball of 6.81 or the spirit breaker and huskar of 6.78). The "mask of madness" era of every hero moving at 522 ms can seriously go to Dota hell~|discuss

Mirana's arrows now hit catapults, actually a somewhat significant nerf.|self.DotA2|~Catapult and hero attack range are often pretty similar.  Being able to stand next to a catapult while sieging a tower is a pretty big buff against mirana.  

Normally the catapults help visually disguise the arrow, and may make a player forget there is NOT a buffer between them and the arrow as the rest of the creeps move on past. 

I often found that an arrow is more likely to not be dodged if a catapult is sitting in the path of the arrow. Now players are 100% safe there,  and can abuse this to remove just about all likely arrow pathways so they can focus on the tower more easily. 

You might think that its worthwhile to hit the cart to squash most of the tower damage, but the tradeoff is really negative if you could have otherwise hit the player instead. In a situation where there is only creep pressure, maybe sure, however, using arrow on catapults isn't really a good use of mana early game. I see this very rarely coming into play in a positively beneficial or necessary manner. 

In my mind the extra obstacle to her arrow landing is a big enough nerf to counter the buffs she got this patch.

Dota 2 players, you have no idea how lucky you are that there is no Surrender-button!|self.DotA2|~Alright, so regularily I play Dota 2, and I've got a decent 1.4k hours on record currently. I, like many others, have had those games where I just think *"Gosh darn it, I wish I could just gg out of this shit"*. But trust me when I tell you, you should be damn happy there is no Surrender-button in Dota 2.

I say this after, while being extremely sick of 6.84 Dota, have spent some hours trying out Smite. Yes, I know, I'm a stupid scrub, I should uninstall yadda yadda, let me get to the point.

Smite has a Surrender vote, and wow. I have played a decent amount of games, and there has not been a single turn-around. Every game is literally won by 10 minutes because by then, the third surrender-vote finally goes through and the game is over. It's insane. Even though I vote no every single time, eventually they stack up against me and the game ends.

In Dota, there are those who all-chat "ggff" after 10 minutes - but at least they don't stop trying! And would you have guessed it, there are actually turn-around victories!

Please Valve, never add a Surrender-option in pubs. And god damn, I love Dota 2.~|discuss

PSA: It is not Mid's job to gank your lane|self.DotA2|~I'm not sure if this is a relic from an old meta or something, but you did not lose the game because mid didn't gank before x time. Typically a hero goes mid for the gold and experience, so why would they risk solo xp to *maybe* get a pickoff for 200 gold? If you get a haste rune as TA or an invis rune as Lina, considering ganking the closest side lane! However, it is ~~~~the supports job~~~~ typically more advantageous for supports to help mid win their lane, not the other way around.

**Knowing when to rotate from mid into a push or teamfight is very important.** If there is pressure from the enemy on your towers, or you could turn the tide of a fight then rotate! I'm sure people will flame mid for not ganking till the end of time, but times they are a-changin'. Buy a smoke and gank the enemy Lina. You'll be happy you did.

edit: I'd like to clarify that I understand every game is different. I've played thousands of matches and I get that everything is circumstantial. Item builds change game to game, and so do rotations. Do what's best for your team, just don't blame them for every loss. ~|discuss
Is it time for Dota overwatch?|self.DotA2|~With the horror of low report world, I'd say so.

For those not familiar, CS:GO has a system where reports are sent to other players to verify if someone is guilty of what they are accused of.  Things like aim-boting, map hacks, etc.

Add a time stamp to reports.  Send them to people.  Affix bans.

In some ways, this would be even easier in dota than in CS:GO since you don't need to be an expert to identify courier feed.

New Winter Wyvern talent does more harm than good|self.DotA2|~In 7.06 Winter Wyvern respawn talent on level 20 was changed to:  
**+1s Cold Embrace Duration**

I think taking this talent is detrimental to your game impact. Level 20 on support is when late game fights start to happen, so having a hero disabled for an extra second gives enemy more time to kill other heroes in a 4v5 fight or throw more magic damage spells.  
Sure cold embrace can be used on a stunned teammate while he cannot act anyway but how many stuns last longer than 4 seconds? The only relevant one is mirana arrow, so this extra second is, again, wasted. And I don't think this drawback is worth a pathetic 20+6%maxhp extra heal.

Instead, if we go that route, the talent should be:  
**+25% cold embrace heal**  
I'd bump that value to 35-40% since the other talent is 120gpm which is important to support

Edit: Another idea mentioned in the discussion: make cold embrace cancellable like Bane's nightmare (should not be tied to talent imo).

Everyone is ok with Wagamama smurfing????|self.DotA2|~He is 8k+ players playing in 4k bracket (massive 4k mmr below his rating) andn obviously ruining games for his opponent no different with any account booster. No uproar against this from community who hates booster and smurf???

 I find it funny that so many of you justify this "he is helping low level player learn the game!" "low level player must be happy having good player at their game!" pathetic excuse imo. I guess this justifies every other account booster who played in the bracket way below their rating then. I surely don't want playing against random 6k players in my 3k bracket who will shit stomping me most of the times, but if you are happy with that, have fun!

TI6 Champions accidentally activating base Shrines|self.DotA2|~There have been numerous threads around here complaining about how easy it is to waste Shrine cooldowns when defending high ground. A lot of the responses dismissed this problem, placing the blame on the players not paying enough attention to where they click.

Well, while watching DC vs Wings game 2, I already counted 3 times that players on Wings mistakenly clicked on Shrines when they were full HP. (They could have turned at least one lost teamfight if they had Shrines available).

So if the TI6 Champions aren't good enough to NOT click the Shrines by mistake, should we start thinking about better methods to activate them?~|discuss
A reminder to those that hate the Reborn client right now|self.DotA2|~The Source 1 client took over 4 years to get into the highly functional state it is (was) today.  For those of you that haven't been around since the First Blood update, when Axe didn't have his manly mutton chops yet, the armory back then, simply called the backpack, was terrible.  Manually moving every single item, no filters, literally no way to organize it.  But they made that shit great, it took a *looooooong* time, but it VASTLY improved the player's interface with their digital hats.

Reborn currently doesn't have many of the features Source 1 does, but it also does not share many of the bugs Source 1 was eternally plagued with.  I don't think I've seen the full store page in over a year, on account of it being zoomed in forever.  The UI was slower, it took longer to load the compendium and player pages, for example.  There aren't tons of unused 'features' cluttering up the Reborn client like Source 1 had (at least not yet), such as recruiting, fantasy seasons, professional team stuff that only 1% of the playerbase used after Team Ranked Matchmaking was removed.  Yes, I could display my favorite hero and eight of my Desert Gale arms but people barely ever saw it save for my friends curious about my player stats. 

Now I can actually showcase items and heroes that were impossible in the Source 1 client.  The overall UI for Reborn is cleaner, easier to read, and more fluid than Source 1.  Much like switching to a new operating system, it might seem foreign and clunky at first but you'll find yourself pertaining towards your new OS and seeing the flaws in the previous.

Finally, constructive criticism is really important right now, such as the many threads stating that the Friends List should be on the frontpage.  This is a change which will drastically improve the user's experience and ease of access into inviting friends and queueing up for a match, as well as seeing friend's games quickly on the go.  There are many small flaws in Reborn that need fixed up as well, but those need to be addressed.  Making a thread because 'you don't like' something 1. Tells Valve nothing except general dissatisfaction about the thing you are pointing to and 2. Is not a priority and/or should not be changed because you disliked changing to the Reborn client.

Some of those tiles are to ensure new players have a point-of-interest on the main page, some are to sell Dota hats so Dota can stay F2P (lmao compendium sales), to update players who barely check patch notes, giving credit to the biggest Dota 2 tournament of the year, so on and so forth.  We should currently be suggesting Quality-of-Life changes, such as the fact that there is no way to directly suggest players in your party to download a Custom Game except for going straight to the workshop page, copy + pasting it, and waiting for everyone to resound an unenthusiastic 'ready' since there is no way to tell who and who doesn't have the file installed.  Same goes for the Essences and Eggs, something that should have been done for years now, but Valve should fix regardless if they're discarding the items.

Alright, now come at me with downvotes or discussion, I'm ready for you to pick this apart so we can start helping Valve make a better client.

EDIT: Valve pushed themselves into a corner (concerning the new patch and majors) and now need the player base to go on to Reborn so they can 100% concentrate on fixing Source 2 in quick fashion.  I'm not exactly happy about it either but we can't get the Source 1 client back anyways.  Constructive Criticism, such as the Friend List or request for Open Mic back, and bug reports are what we need right now, not personal reasons for disliking the client, guild chat, or a complete redesign of the current UI; These posts offer no help to Valve and only help to circlejerk the subreddit.

My proposition for a Techies change, coming from someone who doesn't love nor hate the hero: Make him a 7-7-7-4 hero, like Invoker. No more stats upgrades, only abilities, with a better scaling.|self.DotA2|~I posted this as a comment in another techies thread, but i was pretty late to it and i think not much people saw it, and no one even commented on it. So i'd like to ask your opinions on this.  
  
In my opinion(only 3K mmr, but i've been playing this game for about 10 years) Techies cannot be a 4-4-4-3 hero anymore. He needs to be like Invoker. No stats upgrades, only 4 abilities, going 7-7-7-4, with a much better scaling. Make lvl 6 or 7 red mines be a truly deadly ability. Make lvl 6 Statis Trap be a reliable stun with a shorter preparation time and longer cast range. Make his ulti truly-invisible until the bomb is detonable(the hero doesn't turn in the direction he is placing it, and the bomb doesn't appear in the air until it is on the ground and ready to explode). Allow techies to truly participate in a teamfight, aside from simply suiciding.  
  
I think that this change gives something extremely important to a techies player: the ability to chose what the hero do. Same way you can play a Quas-Wex and an Exort Invoker, you can play a Bomb-placer techies and a more Teamfight Control-oriented techies.  
  
Of course there would have to be some more changes, regarding his atributes mostly, since he will now lack the 20 points in each stat that you get from leveling atributes. Perhaps increasing his atribute gain, to help make him more viable early game, or maybe even attach atributes bonus to his abilities, like Invoker has. For example a point in Mines gives him 1 Intelligence, a point in Statis gives him 1 Agility, a point in Suicide gives him 1 Strenght and a point in Remote Mines gives him +2 all stats.  
  
So, what do you guys think about this?  
  
EDITS: The ultimate is not immune to true sight. It is only undetectable until it is ready to detonate.  
And no, Techies wouldn't have ulti at lvl 1. By saying "like Invoker", I don't mean "exactly Invoker".~|discuss

Valve, I don't know if you realise what DotA is capable of being in the future.|self.DotA2|~Listen **Valve**, 

I loved the progress you made with the community over the past year but we gotta get a couple things straight:

* If only quarter of the prize money invested by players goes to the prizepool you have collected 74 363 748 **USD** for TI7

* Lets exaggerate and say one equivalent of the prizepool went into organizing the event all together

* You basically make infinite money because of Steam

* For some reason VR is your number one priority. Nothing wrong with that. It might be *the future* of gaming for casual *gamers*

* There is no way VR funding costs that much

* DotA 2 has the potential to become the best game ever made

* DotA 2 has the potential to be played for 100+ years. Making it a legitimate sport with stories, legacies and emotion. Something a new generation can look up to.

* Unless you are making DotA 3 in VR I dont know what the fuck are you doing

* Maybe you could invest some time and money into making the dota dev team as big as it can get? You know so stuff like morphling ulti copying invokers exort for 10k damage doesnt happen. I mean who wouldve not tested new morplhing ult with the some of the most played heroes right?


**JUST PLEASE START INVESTING TIME INTO DOTA THAT IT DESERVES, YOU HAVE A PIECE OF HISTORY AT YOUR HANDS READY TO BLOOM INTO THE POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED THINGS IN THE NEXT GENERATIONS**

**Edit**: Researching VR is costly but it is not the point of this post.

**Edit**: Quoting cavad123 comment bellow : "This is about eSports DotA and its community have shown the world that gamers are not to be joked about. With 20+ millions of prizepool DotA is basically the face of eSport its key to be a widely known and accepted sport worldwide."

**Edit**: Bunch of people seem to be spazzing out about the 100+ year argument. It is an exaggeration on my part, more or less its my wish for the game, as the leading Esports game. Do not understand why is it triggering people that much? Would it not be nice to be a 70 year old one day and DotA would still be kicking ass? The game will probably change.

33 Was trying to do something cool with that Aeon Disk|self.DotA2|~Tobi and Kyle didn't get why 33 didn't make his Aeon Disk, and left the Vit booster locked (I don't blame them, it's late over there). So 33 wanted to get an Epi Burrow off, but realised that if he took too much damage during the Epi, or before, he would deal no damage with the Epi. So his plan was to epi, blink burrow, and then, once he was at a lower health, to assemble the Aeon disk, so he could still get out free.
  
It would have been a cool play had they not been SO far behind. It's the sort of thing that could have made a really big difference, if they weren't quite so far behind.~|discussion esports
I love that Dota doesn't have a surrender option|self.DotA2|~I played a few hours of league with a handful of buddies over the last few weeks in exchange for them joining me for some games of Dota. Holy shit, I am so glad that we can't surrender in Dota. 

We were only playing pubs, so I think it's very probable that in ranked it's very different, however there were VERY few games that ended in a victory that wasn't a surrender. I wouldn't let us surrender either (I believe I said, "You chose this life, play the game that you chose to play"). It's actually because some of the most memorable gaming experiences I've had were absurd comebacks or when a friend or I have gotten laughably ahead, so to allow for that to happen for both me and my enemies, I never give up in games.

Essentially the games played out where I would extend that respect to my enemies and lost without surrendering (allowing them that satisfaction of winning and being ahead), or we would get ahead pre-20 and they would surrender. I got fed several times, but every time the game would end at 20 minutes, before my character would hit that fun point on the power curve where I could just not die or simply kill everyone who challenged me. The only games we won that didn't end in a surrender were pretty passive (which I honestly didn't expect from LoL) and everything was decided with one or 2 fights.

I mean my sample size is pretty small, only around 20-30 hours of playing, but after playing LoL again after all of these years, I can say that surrendering is easily the least satisfying mechanic in that game for me, and I'm very glad that it isn't in Dota.~|discuss

It would just gives another bonus to an already not powerfull item, it would still not that powerfull, but you could maybe think on it to deal with some heroes, like Alch, Axe, Bristle, Timber, even underlord with lvl 25 Talent.

How to fix MMR in DotA2 and what's wrong with it.|self.DotA2|~#What's Wrong with the MMR system, and How to Fix It.

To start, I'm going to **explain what is wrong** with DotA2's MMR system, because I guarantee everyone is entering this thread and going to scream "it's not broken 4head!"

Well, *you're right*! **It isn't broken**... kind of. MMR works *perfectly fine* .... assuming a **large quantity of games played** and at a constant rate I might add.

So what does this mean?

*   Anyone who plays a **large quantity** of *solo ranked games*. Your MMR is *perfectly accurate*. If you're the kind of person who plays 8 matches a day and your MMR is still 2537, you probably are still +/-50 MMR accurate.

* Anyone who is under or over rated will likely have to play **hundreds** of games to reach their true MMR.

* Imagine you are rated at 3000 MMR. If your "skill" level rises to 4500 through various things, coaching, playing unranked, practicing, learning proper metas, strategies, changing your outlook, etc. It will take a ridiculous amount of time to get to 4500 MMR.

 * The following is me just making up numbers to the best of my ability, but imagine you can maintain 80% winrate from 3000-3500, and then 65% from 3500-4000, and then 55% from 4000-4500. This is an *extremely* generous approximation, but *even this* would require approximately **300** matches played!

Now, the problem arises with people who *don't* play a **large quantity** of *solo ranked games*.

Lets say you play a lot of party queue games, or perhaps you get coached, or perhaps you simply decide to "learn" dota and watch a ton of replays, and whatever other kind of practice you can do. Your skill level will *very likely rise*. And this goes both ways of course, a 6k player who takes a break for school for 6 months and comes back is *absolutely not* a 6k player anymore. He could be as low skilled as 4k until he gets his practice back, and even then could be starting from a 5k level again.

This is why everyone complains they have so many "feeders" in their games. This is due to the players who are *overrated*. Now you're probably asking, what about the underrated players? Well, they exist too, but you probably just assume anyone doing well on your team is either lucky or you just don't think about it. See: [Negativity Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias)

Ok, enough babbling.


~~~~ **TL;DR:** The MMR System **does work.** But *only* in *large quantities* of solo ranked games.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#HOW TO FIX THE MMR SYSTEM IN DOTA2#

* **Accelerated Change** : Essentially, this is gaining or losing more MMR for having a high or low winrate over a period of time. The exact period would be up to Valve and their smart people. I'm sure they have some smart statisticians or similiar who can decide. But *for example* it would sample your matches on the past 15 games. If your winrate was 70% you would start earning more and more MMR per game. The opposite would hold true if you did poorly.

   What would this do? Well, it will accelerate the change in MMR. Now what are the effects of this? What comes to mind for me is the following:

 * MMR will be *slightly less* accurate on an individual level **assuming a large quantity of games**. This is because fluctuations will be slightly larger. But someone maintaining ~~50% will not see much effect from this.


 * MMR will be *more* accurate on an individual level **assuming a low quantity of games**. This is because they will go up or down faster reaching a more accurate MMR more quickly.


 * MMR as a *whole* will be more accurate as all players become more properly calibrated. Games will slowly become more and more balanced.

 * Boosting will be easier. Is this a bad thing? **No!** You can't eliminate boosters, people are going to do it. But if the boosters start winning MMR much more quickly, then the account will go up *much much faster* resulting in **less games ruined**.


 * The same holds true for when the boosted takes over, he will start losing and dump MMR faster, causing **less games ruined**.


 * This might even kill boosting, nobody would bother because their MMR will dump too quickly. Only people who showcase MMR and never play will still use boosting. (See: re-calibration for the solution to people who don't play at all.)


* **Re-Calibration** : Again, pretty straight forward, but **forced** re-calibration **without a choice to choose MMR** should be a thing. This worked perfectly in StarCraft2 where if you didn't play at all during a season you would be forced to recalibrate where you can generally move up or down an entire division. If you don't play for *2 entire seasons* then your rating is dumped completely and you have to start from scratch.

 * Now because DotA2 is a team game it is much harder to calibrate than a solo 1v1 game. I don't think believe dropping MMR or forcing it every season it the best idea, but if a **low quantity of solo games** are played then re-calibration could be flagged on an account. The players who are active and still playing should still have an accurate MMR and won't need to be re-calibrated.

 * MMR becomes inaccurate over a long period of time with a low quantity of games. Personally I believe the *best way* to go about this would be to require a certain amount of games played in a year or else you will be placed into a queue for re-calibration. For example, if you don't play 100 matches within 1 year, then the system will eventually flag you for re-calibration.

* **Leagues/Divisions** : *Generally* using leagues or divisions is a personal preference, because at the root it is still using your MMR number, however, it has some pros.

 * In the case stats are used to assist in MMR calibration again, hiding the changes behind the division will be a layer preventing people from gaming the system.

 * They are prettier to look at than a simple number, but of course, this is just preference.

 * The MMR Number could still be displayed if you mouse over your division, or if Valve decides to try to phase it out they can make it accessible via the console.

* **POSSIBLY: Stats Influence MMR Change** : Now, I know this is an **extremely** **controversial** one, so take it with 3^2^2 bags of salt, especially because of abusers and the fact that support is such a sacrificial role it's near impossible to rate support players on their stats. **However** I believe some important facts remain:

 * Using stats would only be a small change to MMR increase or decrease compared to winning or losing a game. If you lose a game you still would lose for example -25, but if you played **exceptionally** well (I'm talking you're 30-3, and your team is all 0-15), perhaps you only lose 22 points.


 * Stats would be compared to **other players** on the **same hero** at a **similar level**. Playing Zeus just because of his hero damage won't help you, because everyone else playing Zeus also has a high hero damage. Playing Ember/Naga/AM/etc. because they have low deaths/high GPM won't help unless you do better than the other players at your level on that hero.


 * Stats for *Core* heroes would still be relevant. Stat ratings for supports could be disabled entirely, or only using sparingly. (Deaths, Assists). Having 3/5th of your player base with slightly more accurate MMR is better than having nobody take advantage of it.


 * Disabling or using stats sparingly for supports will cause support players to accelerate MMR more slowly (an underrated support won't go up *as* fast as an underrated core) but the system doesn't break. They just experience less acceleration for doing well or poorly.


 * Again, this is controversial and I think only the first suggestions (acceleration, re-calibration & leagues) here are important but Valve could even add this under the hood to prevent people from gaming the system. Combined with Leagues hiding MMR, and the new acceleration system it would be near impossible to even know Valve is using this, so nobody would be complaining it is unfair for supports (it would be slightly) but in the end it would be beneficial overall in my opinion.


 * And lastly - Yes, stats don't always matter. You can have lower GPM, more deaths, less kills and still win a game through sheer skill and outplaying your opponent, but this would only be a small increase/decrease to MMR per game and **on average** stats **do matter** (Stats don't lie!). A good player can definitely win a game from behind, but on average a player with higher GPM/XPM/More Kills/Less Deaths/More Damage/Tower Damage/etc. will do better.

I'm an old man and cosmetics confuse my brain|self.DotA2|~I know this might not affect you, I know you might not care, the majority of people will think I'm a blind scrub and should get glasses, but I've seen a growing number of people on this subreddit that feel my pain and I want to share my story.

When there's a teamfight, the particle effects are flying and I have a split second to make decisions, I cannot always tell the difference between Skywrath in the Vigilance of the Manticore set and a Legion Commander.  I've mistaken a Spectre with the Flowering Shade set for Vengeful spirit and thrown a teamfight.  I've been hit with the new red Phoenix sun ray and shat myself because I didn't remember the Drakken laser drill being added to the game.

There's so many visual effects in Dota, and I recognise and know how to react to all of them, but every time some big ass flapping wings or blue glowing Earthshaker gauntlets get added to the game I find it that little bit harder to react to them I.E. I immediately fly into a crazed panic at the new effect I've not used to.

Now I love my hats as much as the next man that keeps throwing his non-expendable income at virtual dress ups, but... can we please get a client side option to disable cosmetics?

I'll still shill out money to get my heroes looking good (obviously I don't mind if my own hero has custom cosmetics since I don't get confused by skills that I'm casting) and the majority of people wouldn't utilise this option, but does anyone agree it would be nice to have?

Sincerely, a noob that doesn't like these damn young kids and their crazy disco ball dota aesthetic.

I analyzed every Chronosphere cast in the Main Event of TI6 and here are the results|self.DotA2|~* There were **206 chronospheres** in **21 Faceless Void games**, with an average of **9,81 chronos per game**. Of those, 13 caught no enemy heroes at all (6,3% of the total), and 2 were cast by **Alliance.EGM**'s Rubick.

* **EG.Universe** played Faceless Void the most: 4 games (3 victories) and used 50 chronospheres (**24,4% of total chronospheres**).

* The highest amount of chronospheres in a single game was 15, and it happened three times: two wins for **EG.Universe** and one win for **Wings.Shadow**. 

* The lowest amount of chonosphere in a single game was 6, and it happened in two different games: A win for **DC.Resolut1on** and a loss by **OG.Moon**.

* **TNC.Sam H.** had the most precise chronospheres vs OG on game 2: He caught 26 heroes in 11 uses, for an **2,36** average.

* On the same game, **Sam H.** also landed 3 **four-man chronos**. There were only 4 other four-man chronos in the entire main event, by Moon, Moo, MP and Resolut1on.

* **MVP.MP** had the game with the **most lethal chronospheres** vs OG. He cast the spell 7 times, whereas **19 enemy heroes died in the teamfights that followed**, whether they were hit by the spell or not.

* On DC vs EHOME, **DC.Resolut1on** cast **9** chronospheres, his first being at **9:09** and  finished the game with **9** kills.

* Out of the players with more than 1 game on Faceless Void, **OG.Moon** had the **2nd best average heroes hit per chronosphere**, with 2,02 on two games. However, he lost those games. The other two games of OG in the Main Stage also featured a Faceless Void in the enemy team, making OG **1/4 in games with Faceless Void** on them. On the group stage, the team was 1-1 with Void and 1-1 against it.

Very proud of Sumail|self.DotA2|~Seeing him now on the panel makes me think of when he couldn't do media interviews that well. But now he seems at least somewhat comfortable in front of the camera.

Edit: O wow front of reddit. didn't know Sumail was such a polarizing figure in the dota community. but you got to respect the guy for his skills. I watch UFC a lot and I don't like Jon Jones, but he is at the top of his game like Sumail. you got to enjoy these once in a generation talents while they here.~|discuss esports

The Dota 2 Workshop and Economy: Problems and Solutions|self.DotA2|~    This is written from an artist point of view.

**Item interest has gone down mainly because of 4 main factors.**
-------

* **Reborn UI**
* **Trading**
* **Shop**
* **Workshop**

-

To elaborate here is a list of all the major problems we can think of right now that contribute to the decline of the economy.

-

*Reborn UI*

* No in game store page. Many users dont go outside the game client for Dota 2 related stuff. Make it easier for them to find and buy in the game.
* No ways to display our profiles or personalise our client. Loading images dont load as background in the main screen. No way to show our personalised hero loadout in our profile. Only 3 tiny thumbnail images to show off our items.
* Effigy creation is bugged in reborn.
* A lot of items are bugged in reborn, especially arcanas.
* Equipped items dont swap out after trading and reloading the hero in game by dying. 
* Armory link is harder to get to nested inside the HEROES page.
* Featured Heroes page feels cramped.
* The hero loadout page to equip items is more complicated than it should be and inconsistent to the simpler, hero pick screen item equip page. 
* Better structured Custom games UI that had panels like the main UI showing of new and popular mods will free up room in the main UI for a better store advertisements and sales panel.
* Lower drop rate of free item in game after a match.

-
*Workshop Requirements Page*

* Outdated models and texture packages on some heroes.
* No new heroes to work on, when troll and tinker, Winter Wyvern, phoenix and undying have been broken down for months.
* Page is difficult to find on the main workshop page; Art guideline pages difficult to find for newbies and less user friendly to view, compared to the CS:GO workbench guide.

-
*Trading locks and rarity*

* Over Saturation of items have worn out the player base.
* Cant trade items for months at a time.
* Rarity means nothing anymore, only arcana has a little prestige because of the high monetary value. 
* Whole item sets are set to mythical; unlike in the past where only the best item in the set will have the tag Mythical or Rare.
* Lack of Common and Uncommon sets.

-
*Item store never gets any new items*

* Everything is hidden in a RNG limited time chest
* Or double hidden in compendium chests or stretch goals.
* People have no real way to impulse buy things they like and see in game.
* Items do not display the list of authors on a set, so artists get no branding.

-
*Chests that do go in are only tournament or event chests*

* For an artist its who you know not how good you are or how many votes you get.
* Chests have a sharp sales fall off compared to sets, as the sales for the chest drop as soon as a new chest come out, which could be a week apart. 
* Where as with sets, it will always stay relevant with flash sales and impulse buys from the store or hero loadout.

-
*Workshop is stale*
 
* No feedback from valve, sets will rot on the store with no word on if valve has even seen the set, and artists can feel demoralised and stop making new items.
* Cramped and clunky layout makes for little patience to view.
* Voting Items/collections get minimal exposure on the main workshop page.
* Voting queue is slow, clunky and makes you full view collections with no in game images and asks for votes just on that.
* Voting doesnt correlate to sales data.
* No clear way to upload and submit music packs and scores to the workshop.

-
-
-----------------------------

**Possible Solutions**
----


*Reborn UI* 

* Give more UI to showcasing items and personalising our profile, Source 1 had 6 + loadout, reborn has 3.
* Bring back the buy this set option in the pick screen
* Bring back a proper store front in the Main Client. Have it in one of the main tabs at the top of the screen.
* Bring back a hero show off in the dota profile.
* Simplify the Hero loadout screen to equip items.
* The featured page should load more heroes that you can scroll through like card mode in all pick with UI for links on how to purchase the items equipped there. 
* The featured page should be scaled so the heroes dont look so cramped.
 
-
*Tournament UI*

* Tournament View sections should have Direct links to their chests to buy like their tickets. 
* Premier Tournaments should get a featured page too with advertising to their bundle and their tournament streams, extras and a calendar with options to follow tournaments in game with steam or in game notifications on when they are going live.
* 


*Shop*

* Have a shop front in Reborn in the UI
* Add full sets back to the store at a medium pricing $4-6 and couriers
* Have limited edition items on the store that show up for 12 hours every few weeks. Put it on rotation with a selection of limited edition sets. Make their prices high, ie $10-12.
* Add back 99c singles chests with special effects MADE by FX artists of the workshop. Have them submit FX chest ideas and the best ones go through.
* Have loadout animations and taunts be equippable and submittable in the workshop. add those to the 2.50 chests as bonuses.
 

-
*Tournament Chests*

* Have tournaments apply for tournament item bundles/chests. Determine the contents based on the initial prize pool or budget of the tournament High prize pools get 2-3 sets, medium gets 2-3 single items and everything else can have 1 single item. 
* Valve curates items from the workshop to add to the bundles. Splits are pre set for each budget bracket and cannot be changed. ie high prize tournaments have a 75/25 split, medium prize pool tournaments gets 65/35 and low gets 60/40.
* Have a maximum number of tournament chests available for application each month, in each bracket, to not swamp the store.
* Have timelines for tournaments as to when their bundle will be added ahead of time so the tournaments can organise marketing and other plans around it, also to stop tournament chests getting released 1 week from the tournament grand finals resulting in low crowdfunding and marketing.


-
*Make the workshop more accessible*

* Workshop queue is clunky and annoying, make a scrolling queue at the top of the item page that shows 1 image of the set in game, name of collection and author, a favourite button and a link to the collection/item page.
* Add collections to the main (most popular today) thumbnail wall.
* If a uploaded item is in a collection by the same author, remove all entries from the front page and only add the collection thumbnail.
* Add the workshop voting queue to the Reborn UI somewhere.
* Add more images to collection pages, so people don't have to click on an item to see it in game, also let up put images in the description like regular item pages.
* Follow Workshopper button is quite hidden, and could perhaps be a button directly on the item/collection pages to follow all the creators
* Have a way to pre order sets, where people drop some money to pre purchase the set they want a few days before it goes live. Where they have the option to pay the rest of the cost.

-
*Sets sit on the workshop with no feedback*

* Add a simple red/green light system for valve to quickly give feedback on if a set is accepted or rejected. 
* Add a simple 2 second feedback survey for a reviewer could be a 10 or so choice of feedback lines that they can respond with, like: Does not fit in the style of Dota 2, please read the art guidelines at LINK for more information.

**Workshop UI:**

-

Why does this get more real estate... [Image 1](http://puu.sh/lRg65/a49394db2a.jpg) Compared to this? [Image 2](http://puu.sh/lRg9G/9c08d3b48f.jpg)

Items that are already in game don't need this much workshop attention anymore, thats what the Store should be doing.

-
-
**Workshop Front Page**

Workshop front page is filled with multiple items from the same set which reduces the chances of other sets or items being shown.
[Image3](http://puu.sh/lRkeN/8d3b99eb88.jpg)


-
**Reborn Equip items UI:**

-
Replace the OWNED section of a loadout with the simpler item boxes instead making people go to a whole new page. [Image 4](http://puu.sh/lRtnm/3de473f3b1.jpg)

-
The Customize page button is lost on a lot of people as it is not in the general customisation UI area, it's sitting under the hero and greyed out. With above changes one would never need to visit that page, so it can be removed.

Full translation of LGD.Ruru Scandal|self.DotA2|~Original post : [Link](https://www.zhihu.com/question/54026580/answer/137989692)

This is a word by word translation, I am trying to keep the original tone as much as possible.

The OP is the cofounder and  former employee of VPGAME, which is the biggest Esports betting site in China, owned by LGD.

Ruru is the owner of LGD, LFY all cdec teams, VPGAME and KeyTV.

&nbsp;

**The post has 2 parts**

&nbsp;

Disclaimer by OP: Perfect World does not know about the API-KEY, and all players are respectable. 

&nbsp;

**Part1(not too related to the topic I will briefly explain it, if would be grateful if someone wants to expand part1)**

OP wanted to leave VPgame to join his friend's company(C5game). There were some disputes about his stock in VPgame and C5game copying VPgame's product. LGD.ruru sued him right after they made some agreements, so OP went mad and exposed all the stuff below.

**One thing worth mentioning is that Ruru asked him to use his connection to delete bad posts about Nanyang replay cup(Nanyang crusie) because people was flaming her for match fixing and airing replays.**

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Part2("I" refers to OP)**

**In 2013, Ruru stole an API-KEY from Steam**. The normal API-KEY can only view the data of public matches, however the stolen one was able to view private matches, and this is the reason why 
VPGAME in early stage can view the results of private matches. Using this API-KEY, under the instruction of Ruru, **we build a database system which was able to browse other teams' training results(draft/build)**, so that we can figure out the opponents' strategies and the way to counter it. Personally, I think all the players who accomplished things are legit, and I don't think any of the players were using those data, I think it is mostly for the stats man in the team.

&nbsp;

If you try to go to http://www.vpgame.com/das/ then it redirect you to the login page, that means the page actually exists.

Since you try to go a page under vpgame.com but it doesn't exist, it will return a 404 error.

For people who need further explanation:( means scrim)

Those two games are scrims between IG.V and IG, for pro teams, keeping scrims results secretive is extremely important.

&nbsp;

**The other thing is (another Chinese betting site)'s dragonclaw hook and Rotten Stache got stolen.**

When we first got the API, we didn't know we could **move users' items using the API**. After Ruru mentioned it, we tried it and it worked out and we reported to Ruru. Then what we did was move 's dragonclaw hook and Rotten Stache to DOTAMAX(another Chinese site, more similar to dotabuff, but has betting function as well), to create more chaos, we moved some of VPGAME's arcanas to DOTAMAX too. **So that we can fool Valve that DOTAMAX scammed those items.(ajijijiji added this, op wasn't being too clear, ajijijiji was a bit confused early too)**

[original](https://pic1.zhimg.com/v2-eb2252a8c9e703fdce188b05cf276b78_r.png) //////////// [**mirror**](http://imgur.com/qihVttg)

(this is my(ajijijiji) tranlation, this is a chat group, and the chat group name is "**founders of VPGAME**", 3 means the group has total number of 3. **OP(green) said  has already reported to Valve about the loss, and then Ruru( the female avatar) said move 200 arcanas to DOTAXMAX and report loss to Valve as well**)

&nbsp;

**Update**

the das section under vpgame has already been deleted, but still it says updating, it would be 404 error if it doesn't exist at all.

&nbsp;

**Most recent update**

Look at those complaints made by users about losing items

[**mirror**](http://imgur.com/uvnCmol)

LMAO Ruru even made post on SGamers to flame me. I am not gonna expose much more proofs, because I need to save some for myself for the trial case. You will regret for it if I actually expose it(kinda hard to translate this line, but u get the meaning). It would ruin the whole esports industry.

&nbsp;

**Update** credit to /u/Aelvez

News Update: A former Valve employee(Langelic, he disclosed his identity) confirmed the existence of said key. He also said he was aware of the drama and had reported it to Icefrog in November. [source](https://www.zhihu.com/question/54026580/answer/138129296)

Conversation with Icefrog(in English, check the date too): [pic1](http://imgur.com/a/CZWlp) [pic2](http://imgur.com/a/txaNc)


&nbsp;

**Everything above was from the original OP**. 

&nbsp;

**TLDR for lazy people**

&nbsp;

LGD is the owner of the biggest betting site in China - VPGAME

LGD.ruru stole an API-KEY

VPGAME was able get scrim data of all other teams.

VPGAME was able to move items freely between any steam users, they did it in a way making valve think other competitors(,DOTAMAX) scams their users.

&nbsp;

***Here is my take on this:***

Ruru is the owner of LGD(pro team), VPGAME(betting site), KeyTV(the one which ruined Shanghai Major and got fired midway), due to conflict of interest, I am not sure if this is allowed. 

Also Ruru's ex-husband jingling(they divorced), is a key figure in Perfect World. 

Chinese dota fans are already suspecting if LGD has some secret deal to Valve so that Valve send LGD to Boston. 

Ruru is also the girlfriend of Inflame(who used to play for ehome and cdecy), and has a lot contracts dispute with other pro players.

I wanted to say a few things!|self.DotA2|~I want to start off by saying that I don't post on Reddit much, if at all mainly because it seems that just reading is enough to glean what criticism I can for my commentary and just try to improve from there. (Also I'm a pretty shitty writer in general lololol)

But it has occurred to me that there are a lot (more than I'd like) of you who seemingly can't stand my commentary for multiple reasons, I'd like to dedicate this post to you guys especially.  If there are others out there who like what I do already, then that's great too.

When I first started commentating, I lacked a lot of what you would call "confidence" in many aspects of the game because even though I had played DotA for a number of years off and on, I was never a pro.  I moved to HoN and played professionally there for a short time, did fairly well and decided to retire.

My point is, as I commentated more and more it's only natural to feel more comfortable with something.  Your mind innately goes to a very black and white state where you just say "Oh this is good" or "This is bad" and the reasoning is pretty straight forward.  

As a commentator, analytical or not we try to sound sure of ourselves so that our audience (the ones maybe not as experienced in DotA) can follow the game whilst we try our best to paint a picture verbally for them to follow.  For example, what lineup is better at what point in the game, what the other team can do to try to stop that team in the alotted time etc.  This is a very basic example, but the point I'm stressing is we have to deliver a storyline for whomever can't piece it together themselves just by watching.

Under normal circumstances this kind of mentality I would say is normal, maybe even acceptable; but in a game like DotA that is ever changing, I don't think I can afford to be that way anymore.  I will admit that I am probably one of the harshest commentators (maybe the worst) when it comes to how I express my thoughts on the state of the game.

This is inherently where the problem lies.  We have gotten to a point where the community in general have 
much more knowledge than they used to. Even enough to the point where they can call out blatant mistakes by commentators during the game and then it starts all sorts of other issues that we (myself included) can sometimes get defensive over.

On top of that, I am wrong often.  Not just a little, a lot.  DotA is a game that is so complex that it's very difficult to glean what can make or break a game just by watching.  As I mentioned previously, I've never played professionally so I lack a lot of the experience that obviously pros WOULD have to correct me on issues of which I'm wrong.

My solution to this is to try and watch more games, pay closer attention to finer details and restrain myself from saying things that are absolutes, this really kills credibility for commentators especially when we're wrong.  I of course am no exception to this.

On a final note; this is actually something that I was hesitant to write because I am known as a bit of a DotA 2 rager.  When I'm playing with my friends I do get a bit irritable, but I've known them all for around 10 years.  They know I'm not being serious and the people in the house also realize that I'm not genuinely angry with them in any way; when we commentate together it's all in good fun and I guess it's part of my quirks to be the ornery old looking guy.

I think most people who have met me realize that my personality is far from what it is during a losing DotA 2 game, as I'm sure some of you out there have experienced yourselves.

I feel that I've covered most of what I wanted to say, it's probably full of grammatical errors and all sorts of horrible nonsense.  I really appreciate the time if any of you took to read it all the way through, I'll try my best to keep improving to give you all a better listening and viewing experience.

My journey in DotA 2 so far has been fantastic, mainly thanks to you guys at home reading this post.  I'd do anything in my power to stay as long as possible, so if you have anything you'd like to say in terms of what I can do better; post away.

Love you guys!

Low Priority bot abusers receiving 8 year bans.|self.DotA2|~*FOR THE PEOPLE BELIEVEING THEY ARE DOING NOTHING WRONG USING THESE BOTS, PLEASE SEE SECTION 4 OF TOS AND STOP ARGUING WITH EVERYONE IN THE THREAD. WHEN YOU STILL FEEL THE ARGUE ABOUT IT, JUST READ THE SECTION THAT SAYS THEY CAN CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT AT ANYTIME WITHOUT GIVING YOU NOTICE: http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/*

Over the last week or so I have seen an increase in the number of people being banned until 2025. The one thing all of these players have in common when you search through their opendota or dotabuff accounts is that they had recently played in Single Draft games with 9 bots. When confronted about it most players are saying that they did not have anything to do with the bots, but rather that they paid for a low priority removal service. 

https://imgur.com/a/rBrLW

https://imgur.com/a/SJEn0

I have also seen some players complaining about their 8 year bans who admit that the account is bought. Is this what we have been waiting for? Account boosters being put of of business with the accounts they sell being flagged for a ban? I sure hope so.

Does anyone else have any more info on this. Has this being going on for long or is it relatively new step forward?


**EDIT**

Here is a sample of 2 games played by a banned player for you to see;

https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3394327154

https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3394297634

**EDIT 2**

Some players being banned are also reporting that a few days prior they received this message on their accounts for a few hours.

https://imgur.com/EDBCySB

**EDIT 3**

There are comments in the thread indicating that players abusing bots are also receiving bans from 1 - 3 months long. Makes it seem as though there is some sort of system in place for how often or much you used a bot service?

**EDIT 4**

The following is a comment from u/henry_rd . Thanks to his comment we can now see that it is no longer speculation and it is happening. 

"I was banned, not for 8 years but for long enough that I could get another account to 6k (banned mmr) before i'm unbanned.
I have really been working on behavior and it's a shame I was banned for mistakes I worked hard to try to fix, but I understand it and won't be getting in LP again.
I really feel the #1 reason I used bots is because I saw other people who ruined my games do it and it's pretty rage inducing to be toxic and have other toxic people just get out of jail free, so you kinda want what they have.
But I'm still accountable and I'm thankful valve doesn't IP ban so I can prove I am #reformed."~|discussion
The Manila Major Group Stages Feedback Thread|self.DotA2|~Hello there,

The group stage is *almost* over and now its time to pack up and move production to the Mall of Asia Arena. In the last couple of days youve seen me and my colleague /u/BossmanCG pop up from thread to thread to answer questions and talk about issues you mightve raised. You may have even seen some of [our production vlogs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc04j0shLOEda3Zww-nSj4zDq5FWMY61Q) from behind the scenes and today a [Facebook post by our broadcast director](https://www.facebook.com/petrescu.vlad.1/posts/803735113095359?pnref=story) was featured on the front page for a while. 

So we havent been that secretive, but we havent been 100% honest either. This is our first big international Dota 2 LAN event. While we do have Dota 2 ex-pros in our crew, overall the team is a noob when it comes to Dota 2. I myself have only played the tutorials and a couple of bot-matches. :) 

So it is our turn, as a team, as a crew, as a group of people working on a project together, to ask you what you think about this event so far. Truthfully, honestly, in the spirit of constructive criticism and making this event great. For everybody. 

* What features did you like?
* What features didnt you like?
* What would you like to be added?
* How do you feel about outside-of-the-game features? 
* Camera work, sound design, video content, interviews?
* What do you expect from the Main Event?
* What do you definitely NOT want to see at the Main Event? (outside of delays, which, we get, are nasty, but theyre nasty for us too) :)

Tell us. We will listen and we will care. 

EDIT: Wow, you guys have A LOT of opinions. Which is a good thing. While we cannot answer each individual, we do read every single comment here, I and the crew. Thank you for your input! Today we spent setting up MOA. You should see that stage... but i guess you have to be a little patient. :)~|discuss esports
Compendium updates have clogged the developer pipeline, leaving old content to rust|self.DotA2|~#edit: problem is the community, not valve

The latest compendium promises battle cups, player cards, more predictions, another round of immortal cosmetics, lockless cosmetics, and TI merchandise items.

_____________________________________________________________________________

We're anxiously waiting for compendium content that Valve is piling up while the following issues have taken a back seat:

* Performance - There's currently a front page thread full of users explaining how source 1 had better FPS. We understood that a new engine would introduce some short-term problems, but we're getting to the point where this is a serious issue.

* Guilds - ??? What can you even write here to emphasize how much of a colossal failure has taken place. This was functionality that had the potential to be extremely useful. Think of the possibilities: Organizing in-house leagues? Catching up with your regional chat? The UI is awful, I'd rather mash a bunch of Steam profile ID's into a .txt file to stay organized.

* Replay Takeover - Yet another glorious feature Valve rolled out to us that has been left to rot. Let's be clear: failing to port over source 1 content means source 2 hasn't been fully rolled out.

* LAN - Have people forgotten about this? Does anybody else remember when this was a huge deal? This used to be a weekly demand on this subreddit for years. We got a botched pseudo-LAN "dev solution" that filled a checkbox. People were extremely disappointed. Remember when we would fantasize about running tournaments on ACTUAL LAN? IN THE YEAR 2013.  

* Leaderboards - Go visit dota2.com/leaderboards. What in the hell is going on?

_____________________________________________________________________________

Dota 2 used to be in a place where we thought: "Wow! I can't wait to play Dota 2 next year, Valve is going to add x, y, z." Now we just want that cool XYZ shit to work.

It seems that Valve has funneled all of their dev time into delivering features alongside the compendium. We no longer play a free game with free updates. We play a free game with sponsored updates. 

Not sold? Those battle cup tickets are for compendium owners. Veterans, think about how that compares to older updates.~|discuss

Stack 5 camps at once on Radiant with Venomancer at lvl 1|self.DotA2|~After though after some testing, I found that you can use plague wards to aggro creeps multiple times before they stack, meaning they will run out and back into the camp before stacking. Using this to stack 2 camps in advance, stacking 2 with your hero, and  stacking the last with a plague ward on the stack time, you can stack the entire jungle without too much micro.

https://youtu.be/AEiuAtHmiQg

 For this to work, you need to cut down at least 4 trees with tangos  or your/ally quelling blade . Also, you need vision of the far right camp, this could mean a observer ward, but you can use another plague ward as well.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2p6cQ24tviiX0JoMkRHOUFnVmM

Keep in mind that plague wards WILL block camps.

This should work with any creeps as long as you don't put the 
wards too close to the edge of the cliff when there are ranged creeps.

As for dire, I found its best to only stack 3. You could stack the other 2, but you will have to pull the large camp to the left into the lane and a plague ward by the small camp will die easily to any ranged creeps.

Idea for new game mode: New Meta|self.DotA2|~Top 5 heroes by pick rate are banned

Top 5 heroes by winrate are banned.

If they overlap as in ODs winrates high and so is his popularity he counts as a winrate hero and the algorithm changes to the 6th most popular and so on until the ten heroes are banned.

The game otherwise plays like All pick (ranked pick version in ranked unranked in unranked)

For example this week: Invoker, Pudge, Legion Commander, Juggernaut, and Phantom Assassin would be banned for having a high pick rate.

Omniknight, Spectre, Necrophos, Abaddon, and Ursa would be banned for having a high winrate.

This mode would not replace all pick but would let us get away from the meta. Though it would instantly have its own meta of course it would at least be a major change.

EDIT: Ban pick, pick Ban and All ban. Whatever the game modes name where everyone gets one ban would be nice but Valve has ignored us on that.

EDIT2: Idk why so many people think that all pick would suddenly go away if they added this mode but no it is not intended to replace all pick.~|discuss

Rumor: TI8 will not take place at Key Arena this year.|self.DotA2|~Heyo! For those of you who don't remember me, I'm RR and I [wrote the guide to TI7](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6pco6e/welcome_to_the_international_2017_here_are_the/) last year, because I was working for the security company at Key Arena. Well, as I'm still closely knit with the company, I've been hearing many rumors and speculation as to the location of this year's TI.

If you haven't heard, [Key Arena's remodel has been finally approved](https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/nba/keyarena-mou-approved-by-seattle-city-council-will-nhl-announcement-soon-follow/) and may start this year. If so, we're looking at an Arena that can't be used. 

Supposedly, according to my colleagues, TI8 would take place in Canada, making the only logical location [Rogers Arena](https://rogersarena.com/) due to its sheer size. I'm not going to comment on the political nature of the change, because TI8 could just as easily be hosted out of CenturyLink Field in Seattle, being just as massive (and with an attached theater for tourist attractions). 

Anyhow, that's my TI news. I hope it's not true, because if so, that means it's going to be real costly to get to Canada for me, and HOW WILL I MAKE ANOTHER GUIDE?

A PSA to all the people who are in LP due to valid reports.|self.DotA2|~People have been crying and moaning lately because of the recent pro players that have been put in LP due to reports.

If you were put in LP due to being toxic/leaving games then you deserve everything you get. 

Your teammates abandon 50 mins into a game and your lp win doesn't count? Your fault for abandoning a team of good players who want to play DoTA.

Your team flames and feeds every game? Your fault for doing the same to legit players.

That NP tps and dies as much as possible? Your fault for feeding in your game.

Seriously get over yourself. Just because pro players are constantly being put in lp due to targeted reports that doesn't mean the same is happening to you. In your bracket its very unlikely you will encounter the same player twice or get targeted reports. Getting reported 4 times in one game wont put you in LP you need to be reported in several of your games. Stop being an asshole and you wont be in LP and stop making excuses like you are entitled to ruin as many games as you want.

RIP my karma I will take the downvotes from all the mad kids in lp.

Why the "No Cellphone/Can't afford" argument is weak and people should stop using it.|self.DotA2|~Most of the concern about the Matchmaking update is that there are players who can't afford to buy or own a cellphone. I find this extremely hard to believe as cellphone usage and ownership has become almost mandatory. 

[According to Cisco, by the year 2020 there will be more people with cellphones than those with electricity at home.](https://newsroom.cisco.com/documents/10157/0/Snip20160202_4.png/80f115a2-f01a-4caf-b280-4a2cdad5c14f?t=1454460225588) Currently, there are more cellphones than toilets.

There's a post saying that only the Western regions (US, EU) will benefit as regions with "poor" countries won't be able to afford a phone. This is false. [According to PewGlobal, there are roughly the same amount of cellphone users in South Africa and the United States.](http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/04/15/cell-phones-in-africa-communication-lifeline) 

[Here is the statistics for India](https://apsalar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/India-Mobile-Users.jpg)

For the Philippines, you're just gonna have to trust me that this is absolutely no problem, even for those squatters in cafes.

THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS YOU IDIOTS ARE ONLY THINKING ABOUT SMARTPHONES. OF COURSE THOSE ARE DAMN EXPENSIVE. ONLY 34% OF USERS IN SA HAVE SMARTPHONES. BUT DID VALVE SAY YOU NEED A SMARTPHONE???? 

Now, let's talk about those genuinely poor but are somehow still able to spend money on internet cafes (you probably can't buy your own pc right?)

I'm sorry but you guys will have to compromise. You are the minority here and it's not even that hard to do. All you need is a SIM CARD and those are cheap. If you played 2 games of Dota in a net cafe then you could have bought a SIM CARD already. Now the hard part is getting a phone to complete the authentication. Maybe you could borrow from your parent or a friend. Hell why don't you borrow the cashiers cellphone. All you need is to put in the SIM CARD you just bought and go ahead and follow Valve's instructions to link your number to your steam profile then to your Dota profile.

We are already in the digital age where even those who are extremely underprivileged have access to technology, albeit outdated ones. 

So for those countries with the ability to play Dota, buying a cheap mobile should be no problem at all.

A responsive DotA2 map?|self.DotA2|~###What do we think about an update to the map where the aesthetics of the lanes/jungle and potentially base/river vary depending on the lane balance (or other game aspects)?.  
*(I think the status of the towers is the most obvious candidate as we dont want to use things like XP/Gold lead or player presence to give away in-game aspects that shouldn't be identifiable in-game.)*  

#### Anyway, basic proposition:  

If the tower balance in a given lane is neutral (2 each, 1 each etc.) the aesthetics remain as default.  

If a given lane has a tower advantage, the surrounding ground could begin to transform to favour the aesthetics of the advancing team such as:  

+ If Radiant has an advantage small tufts of grass could break through the barren ground  
- If Dire has an advantage the grass patches and fades to brown.  

If a given lane has a multiple tower advantage some more grand aesthetic changes could take place in that lane and surrounding zone such as:  

+ Larger, flowering, trees for Radiant. Additions of critters and the like.  
+ The Dire could see more volcanic effects, perhaps some sulphur plumes erupting along the lane. Deeper fault lines in the jungle and surroundings.  
  
If **all** the lanes have a tower advantage for the same team the base and river could see aesthetic responses too:   

+ I'm thinking a literal river of fire for the Dire.  
- A quaint set of flowering Lily pads for the Radiant.  
 
  
#### Considerations  
  
I think the implementation of all these changes would be flawed if it were a sudden transformation, so its not a small ask to code in a progressive flow of aesthetic changes. That being said I personally could see this adding another layer of atmosphere to the game and to the spectator element of the sport.  
  
#### Questions  
+ *Is there any scope of this getting opened up to the community as a workshop element?*  
- *Would this whole idea be something that adds value to the community or detracts/distracts during gameplay?*  
+ *Any suggestions or perhaps designs to share?*~|discuss
The Greatest Matchmaking Complaint Ever|dotametrics.wordpress.com||discuss
Everything wrong with ranked matchmaking|self.DotA2|~**Pick order**

Most high MMR players would agree that having second pick is a big advantage in ranked.  It is often very disadvantageous to reveal cores before the enemy team, as you open youself up to being countered.

In high MMR games, you can have four 5-6ks, and one 8k player.  And same on the other team.  And there's a lot of weight on your shoulder to carry.  This task becomes much harder when you are forced show your pick before the enemy 8k.

A possible solution might be to adopt the pick order of Captain's Mode.  After all, ranked is supposed to be a serious and competitive matchmaking system, why not mimic a tournament pick order.  It's not perfect, since in a pub setting, draft strategy is dwarfed thus showing 3/5 heroes first as FP might still be disadvantageous.  But it would be better than the current show 5/5 heroes first as FP.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Randoming**

In my opinion, randoming in ranked should not be allowed, or only be allowed up to the first two picks.  Draft is an important element to the game, and the damage can be irrecoverable if a player is to third pick random a Lich, when we already have CM and Rubick (as is often the first two picks are supports in high MMR games).

The player is at fault here for pressing that button that can potentially ruin the game.  But why does the game incentivise this by providing such an option in the first place, let alone with extra gold at that.  Why could this not be something that was left behind in unranked, where things are meant to be more casual.

As you would not consciously random a hero in a tournament setting, you should not be randoming a hero in ranked where it's to simulate a competitive matchmaking experience.  

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Gameruining & Punishment**

I was one of many that rejoiced in seeing harsher punishments for frequent LPQs.  But I'm starting to have doubts in its effectiveness.  I've played 12 games yesterday, and [about 9 of them were ruined] (https://pastebin.com/b8JquNWR).  This is not a rare occurrence, it's quite literally every day.  If there's one thing I admire about Riot, it's that they take their user experience seriously.  So much so, that they're willing to permanently ban a player for repeated toxic behaviour (as in, if found playing on any account, he would be banned on sight).  

I think that's a little extreme, but the message is clear; don't ruin games.  What difference is there of a player who ruins games by hacking (VAC), and a player who ruins games by breaking items and running down mid every other game.  

In comparison, dodge punishment goes from 5min, 10min, to a 24hr lockout.  It's so brutal that I did not see anyone messing around with it, even back when dodging was common.  Dodging hardly harms anyone, and yet it seems to yield harsher punishment than actual gameruining.  I'd like to see harsher punishments for LPQ.  A full day lockout from the get go, maybe?  At least from ranked.

I never have reports these days, either.  I don't know if anyone does anymore.  I report toxic enemies too, but as I understand it, I only get my report back if others report him for same offense (comm. abuse).  But that's worthless since no one wants that guy to tank a comm. ban, they want him to serve LPQ.  Which means no one will tick the box for comm. abuse when reporting.  Reporting enemies seems a good way to throw away your reports.  It's a broken and ineffective system.  If enemy is breaking items and running down mid, I'd like to report him for just that, please.

Some of these pick related issues occur with multiple players wanting to play the same role.  Could the game introduce a way to queue with role (or two) preference so that we may not have two players bicker about who goes mid, and one of them ends up jungling or randoming out of spite?  This wouldn't work so well in the very, *very* high MMR games, since you can easily end up with four core players (as they tend to have high MMR).  But you can have different rules above a certain MMR.  What may work for a 3k bracket may not work for 7k.  Just, anything to make the game experience a little less painful.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Closing thought**

This is not my first time making a thread like this.  And I hardly doubt it will be my last.  It frustrates me to no end that Valve, knowing that they have many things on their plate, takes this long to address problems that is the *actual experience of the game*.  Sometimes, I think it's an awareness problem.  Maybe they don't know that it's a problem, and I make these threads in hopes of addressing exactly that.  But it's still frustrating when it took them literally years to fix the duos on solo queue, which only seemed such a reasonable request.  

The only pub experience I have is in NA, and maybe it's not so bad in other regions.  I do believe that every region should have a slightly different matchmaking system (and punishments too), as every region is different in pub culture.  I don't think you can apply the same rules globally.

Please fix what's broke, our user experience.  If ever people get tired of the game and move on, it won't be because of the game itself, but the people.  And its lack of rules to govern them.

Pro Scene just doesn't feel the same anymore...|self.DotA2|~I followed the professional Dota scene for around 2 years rather religiously, but lately it just seems like its lost everything I had originally enjoyed. I loved watching tournaments, seeing my favorite players on my favorite teams, much like any other popular competitive activity. But within the past year, around the time before TI4, the consistency and professionalism of the scene really lost its touch to me. Teams now are playing tournaments with 2/3 stand ins, rosters are changing once a week, it feels impossible to actually enjoy watching a team since one month someone like n0tail is on fnatic, moves to secret, then after a few months, he gets moved to cloud9. Or the whole debacle with Meepwn'd, they are together for a few months, constant drama posts on this subreddit, a loss or two at some tournaments, and the team is gone. It seems like after one loss with a new roster, every team is just giving up and changing the core of their team, rather than just working out the issues and coming back stronger in the next tournament.

This is probably just me, its just been frustrating me since it used to be something I would consider myself passionate about. It just seems like most teams lost a grip on how they used to manage teams, and rather than simply working out the kinks after a loss, they go straight to cutting half their roster and letting everything the identity of their teams go. Obviously, roster changes are sometimes necessary (post TI4 Navi for example) but this just seems like once the major roster changes occurred after TI4, they never stopped.~|discuss esports

Ame now has flamed the whole Chinese dota community.|self.DotA2|~Background: In today's match, LGD carry player Ame has used antimage to eliminate Burning and attack his own items on the highground of IG. Then in the later game against Liquid, LGD throws(should be "lose") two games. Ame also was famous about hating Burning in Chinese community. Once in a pub and stream, ame was opponent of Burning and he shout out on the game"kill that turtle kill that turtle"(turtle is an extremly insulting nick name of Burning in Chinese community)

Chinese community become furious on Ame and curse him on his latest weibo, here are some top ranked comments:

1. I wish you that one day when you are going to retired, your opponent will pick the hero which you used to play the best. Then he will push on your highground in 30mins, and send the words"gg, wp" to you.

2.Low personality person you will never achieve the level of honor of B-god, liquid will teach you how to be mature.

3.Mr. "blink and kill your mother", I will keep an eye on you until one day your mother has been dead and I will dance before her tomb. (the memes of why Chinese call ame the Mr. "blink and kill your mother' originate from: once a fans of lgd tell ame why not buy a blink dagger in the match so that they will not lose in the match, then ame reply him:"I would more like to buy a blink dagger and use that to kill your mother ", then all Chinese fans call him Mr."blink dagger and kill your mother" to blame ame.)

4. I wish liquid to beat you to the extent that your mother will not recognise you (this comment was early before the match between lgd and liquid, and all the replies under this comments are congratulations and laughings)

5.you like to attack your item? could you attack your item before liquid. huh?

6."I, ame , like to attach my item on the highground and take the plane to go home"

7. I wish you daddy liquid will teach you how to play dota and know to respect others.

8.I heard a joke" there is a fool dog, who like to attack his item"

9. Instant karma feels good about it.

10. ATME!(another nick name of ame given by Chinese community, means everyone could get gold from him, always used when ame was killed by others)

There are more than 4000 comments on ame's latest weibo and nearly 99/100 of the comments are criticises and curses on ame. Forgive my poor English. Here is the link of the source:http://www.weibo.com/5695452105/FbUwFlsqj?filter=all&type=comment#_rnd1502510089544

Update1: Now in Chinese forums such as weibo, tieba, sgamer. No one talk about Dendi and AI, no one discuss two new heros and no one care about tomorrow's final matches. Everyone is discussing AME and Burning. Tons of criticises and blames are blurstting under the weibo of LGD official account, old eleven, Ame and so on. What a big storm...

Update2: As required by "zhangfeideya", in order to clarify why those fans of B-god are so furious about Ame, I will give an introduction about some fans (not all of the fans ) of Burning who are easily to be furious. Since Burning has played dota1 and dota2 for so long time. He gains a huge number of fans. Inevitably some of them are zealots of Burning who can not accept any criticisms (or anything seems insulting) on him. These fans have been called "the nuclear bomb fans" of Burning partly because one of Burnings nickname (not a good nick name) is "the nuclear bomb"(a famous meme in Chinese dota community), partly because those zealots of Burning are easily to get exploded emotionally on the criticism (or anything seems insulting) on Burning.~|discuss esports

The nature of ACE's ban on wings|self.DotA2|~For those who have not been following the fiasco, here is a quick outline of the main events:

1. Wings were on very good terms with their boss before TI.

2. After TI the boss got a large slice of the TI money as per contract agreement, and promptly lost it all on a LoL investment

3. The boss stopped paying wings for 2 months and did not respond to communications.

4. At this point, **according to Chinese labour laws wings has full right to terminate their contracts at any time** and the wings boss would need to pay like a full year wage of compensation. But the wings guys just left and formed a team with no fuss.

5. Wings guys posted a blog update about their new team Random and said they are still on friendly terms with the old boss. At this point the issue is somewhat settled, and the boss has accepted his loss because he was at fault.

6. About 3 weeks has passed. Team Random went on to play in the major where they didn't place well but showed strength here and there by taking games off top teams, including 1-2 against both grandfinalists. They aren't doing amazing but probably still in line for a TI invite.

Now at this point the top guys at ACE, who are the top guys at the biggest clubs, realise that Team Random is a huge threat. **They are an independent team made by players with no club, the first successful Chinese team to do so.** As you can see this is now a huge threat to ACE's financial structure. What if Team Random makes bank at TI? Would that encourage all their best players to form their own teams? The best captains are surely more than capable of hiring some caretakers and coaches, and now they don't need to give a cut to the club heads on their winnings and streaming contracts. How would these club heads make money then?

That's why they suddenly jumped in and laid out an absolutely bullshit lifetime ban on the wings players, weeks after the initial issue. At their meeting that decides the bans, neither the wings boss nor the players are present. They don't actually care about the boss' opinions, they just want to kill the team. What other sport gives out life bans for player walkouts? Most give no punishment whatsoever, because real sport players have legit managers that will protect their rights. In fact, there is a rule in the ACE rule book that says if a club does not pay wages for 60 days, they will be deregistered from ACE and their deposit with ACE will be used to pay the players, which would then invalidate their ban on the players who are now not part of ACE. But of course nobody will remember such rules when it doesn't fit their agenda.

On another note, some people in the Chinese community has check the laws and ACE breaks a whole page of laws regarding civil groups/associations, including forced membership, violation of not-for-profit rules, violation of civil rights, etc.
 
&nbsp;


tldr: **ACE is a scum organisation that breaks laws, and they only banned wings to keep their unrightful control over their players to milk as cashcows.**

>And another thing that the contract said is that after you've been your time in the house, you're not allowed to establish your own house / be part of gaming house as a coach etc. for next 10 years.

I can't tell you the last time I bought a dota TV ticket because I'll just watch it on stream to avoid all the technical problems. I think the only thing I buy now are compendiums and announcer packs like the Rick and Morty one. Has anyone else been doing the same thing? I used to be a fiend for chests. What's happened? 

Edit: I forgot to even mention the changes to things being non tradable and such~|discuss
As a CN Dota Fan in Shanghai, i want to express something.|self.DotA2|~Greetings to you guys!
my First time play dota is in 2008Ver 6.51.
not oftenly play nowadays, because engaged with job. but still care about dota affairs and sometimes play with friends.
For the Shanghai major, maybe i can give a CN fan view to you.

1.this Shanghai major is shit, this is common regards of most CN dota fans.

2.CN team's formal match Perfermance is shit and today's CN team abence of ceremony is insult to the audience and Dota, I know that many europe and American fan spent midnight time to watch live ceremony, also there are many many CN audience got to the secene or watched online and also caught this shit.(But there were also exlains from the CN team say that the Valve told them not need to attend the ceremony if they'd not like to.
 for me, I don know if this was ture)

3.Shanghai is fully capable of this big Competition even to TI, Shanghai successfully held World Expo in 2010, F1 , etc... But this time is shit, Maybe Perfect wolrd's Fault, Maybe Valve, probably both.

4.The CN Dota fan forum are now abusing the CN team, CN pro players and the Shanghai major organizers.

5.I think MVP trained hard and deserved what they got today.(CN fans most think so)

I might add something else later, firstly this expressed, and if you got any more questions to ask that im capable of, i would like to anwser, Thank you!

I will try to anwer you guys post after sleep, it's quite late right now.~|discuss esports
Should /r/dota2 have serious threads similar to /r/askreddit?|self.DotA2|~For those who don't know what i mean, basically the OP can decide to make his thread serious, and only "serious" replies are allowed in the thread. I think this might improve the overall environment of /r/dota2 and increase overall happiness of the sub.

Edit: it seems some people are confused. There will still be shitposts where you can spam all you want, it just means that some threads will be more heavily moderated at the OP's choice.

Edit2: I'd like to bring up something /u/Blobthe15 brought up.
> Ultimately it's about where the sub wants to go. Does (at least I think it's the largest) the largest Dota 2 english community just want to become memes about the game or does it want to be literally about the game?

Well /r/dota2? Do we want to be about the game or memes about the game?~|discuss
Before 6.85 is released, let's take a moment to let IceFrog know how much we enjoyed 6.84|self.DotA2|~It definitely had its upsides: Fighting-oriented, no HOHOHAHA, most games were in the 30-45min sweetspot

I miss the sweet Ember

I gotta say at that time I always played Ember

EE Invented Ember, it wasn't any Ember

And now I look at all my pubs and there's so many Embers?! 

I used to love Ember, I used to love Ember

I even had the twin rapiers, I thought I was Ember

What if Icefrog made a patch about Ember

Called "I miss the old Ember" Man that'd be so Ember! 

That's all it was Ember, I still love Ember

And I love you like Gaben loves James's Ass.

Fuck Slacks

What if Drum active had a long CD instead of charges?|self.DotA2|~Of late, Drum of Endurance has experienced a small decline. If you analyse the item its far from efficient for the stats, so in order for it to be worth buying you need to get mileage out of the aura and active, which means being grouped up with your team which, in turn, means pushing and trying to force fights. However, the item falls of greatly after about five events since the charges run out. This was fine when those fights had more meaning, but now that its less valuable to get towers and kills (at least when you have an advantage) the effective worth of the item is diminished.

What if Drum, instead of having 5 charges of active, had unlimited uses but also a greatly increased CD (eg. from 30s to 70s)? Would this be a good change for the item which could make it more popular but wouldn't negatively impact the overall game?~|discuss
Invoker shouldn't turn to cast Sun Strike.|self.DotA2|Similar to Kunkka's Torrent. Both of these spells have long-ass delays and most importantly are far-reaching. It would fit Invoker's lore because let's be honest, cool guys don't look at explosions. It would make room for mind games with the enemy mid-laner, too.|discuss
Valve listens to the community: How do you feel about teammatchmaking including rankings?|self.DotA2|~In the wake of Dotabuff's intention of tracking actual rankings and the almost immediate response from Valve that seemingly shot down the full potential of the project, I was left with the feeling that Valve is taking a lot of precautions to avoid messing up the spirit of teamplay and befriending others all the while ignoring the competitive aspect in the long run. They are basically keeping each single game competitive by ignoring a lot of players needs of longterm stats and ranking. The latter being something most other games do cater to. 


I sincerely hope that Valve has something up their sleeve, which they most likely do (keeping in mind that the game is still in Beta and Valve is always about the end product seemingly regardless of the time it takes to get there) and that they will ultimately accommodate everyones need and not just those afraid of being scolded by bullies. 


*In the meantime* I have a BurNIng desire for them to implement teammatchmaking with added rankings. That would be one way of at least appeasing the competitive souls of those sociable enough to gather a team of five to play against other premade lineups. 


Seeing how fast they reacted on the previous matter, I thought I'd go out of my way to please my own selfish needs and see what the community thought about it. I figured Reddit would be better for this cause rather than TL.net as everyone is somehow represented on these boards and the userbase is bigger. My ulterior motive is of course that Valve implements this within a weeks time.

One feature I would like to see in Reborn..|self.DotA2|..is party replay watching. Right now it's still very hard to coordinate watching a replay together with friends if you're not like in a house with them. You have to all tell each other in voice when to start the replay and when to pause etc. SC2 has had this feature for a long time and I think it helps people point things out in replays and learn and would be nice in Dota 2.|discussion reborn
Official Midas Mode Community Bounty Suggestions: Day 1|self.DotA2|~**Welcome to Midas Mode!** 

This is the official thread to submit your bounties for teams to complete to earn themselves additional Moonbucks for the tournament. 

Don't know whats going on? [click here!](http://midas.moonduck.tv)

Bounties are created by you to influence the way the pros will approach the game. They can be centered around the draft, in game actions, anything you can manage to come up with!

**How it works**

we will submit a thread just like this one 24 hours before the start of the next tournament day, just like this one. You will have **until the end of the broadcast day** to submit your bounty ideas. (any submitted after the broadcast ends will be ignored, please put them in the new thread!) At the beginning of each broadcast day, we will announce our **10 chosen bounties** from the previous day.

The teams are given this list, and are able to complete any bounty they see fit at any time. If a bounty is completed in game 1, it cannot be completed again for game 2 and 3. However, if a bounty is completed in series 1, it is refreshed for series 2. 

Special Note: if a bounty is completed, the team will receive moon-bucks immediately. If a bounty is completed and the team wins, the bounty pays double. 

**Tips and Tricks For Creating Successful Bounties**

Here are some guidelines to have the best chance at having your bounty selected. By all means, feel free to not follow these suggestions, but these are the general things we will be looking for. 

1. Make your bounty easy to quantify and observe. We must award Moonbucks for the bounties completion, so we need to make sure we can know for sure that a bounty was completed both intentionally and completely . 

*Example*
Bad Bounty: Kill Roshan without clicking off it once you click on it (this bounty is confusing, and very hard for us to check to ensure that it was completed till after the match)

Good Bounty: Deny an Aegis (this is easy to identify, its either they deny it or not, despite the circumstance).

Great Bounty: A hero with the Aegis in their inventory must die in the enemy fountain. (creative, easy to identify, and would be fun to watch teams attempt to do). 

2. Be Creative, and make it entertaining. we dont want to do the same bounty twice, and we dont want bounties that are similar to older bounties or are just boring for our spectators to watch. 

Bad bounty: Play a 120 minute game (the only way this will happen is if one team is stomping, then makes the game last super long. no one at home wants to watch this and the players dont want to do this)

Good Bounty: Win in under 20 minutes (one team will attempt to end as fast as possible, and the other team wont want to gg out in fear of giving the enemy the bounty. This creates fun and interesting game-play for us to watch)

Great bounty: Win a Game without losing a tower (fun, interesting game-play which creates a creative new meta for a certain game and would be exciting to watch). 

3. Hedge your Bets. Each day we will select some bounties that can be completed in the draft, some that must be done in game, some that will require you to win, and some that can be done even if you lose. If there is a day without many draft bounties, think of a fun one to suggest, and visa versa. We will be looking for at least one of each. 

**Follow these simple guidelines, and you may just see your favorite pro player attempting to complete your bounty!** Was your bounty not picked? Well, you can try again the next day, and make a new one as well. There is no limit to how many bounties you can submit. 

Happy Contract writing, we at Midas Mode cant wait to see what you come up with!

Do you think valve should implement Prime Matchmaking?|self.DotA2|~Valve recently added Prime Matchmaking in CSGO, allowing for accounts to be synced up with a users phone. This allows for a person to sync one account per phone.

This has caused, from my experience, an overall better matchmaking experience. This avoids smurfs, purchased accounts, and griefers.

Do you think Dota could use this as well? Do you think it will have, if at all, an effect on matchmaking?

Edit: Thanks for all the discussions guys! Its definitely opened my eyes to many different situations and how all of this can effect Dota and its community in both positive and negative ways.~|discuss

Teasing is getting out of hand|self.DotA2|Honestly the pro scene demands to be treated like professional sportsmen and yet almost everyone who is involved in pro dota is acting like a 12 year old child with this "i know something u dont so lets post random cryptic bullshit everywhere".

Patch waiting room.|self.DotA2|~This is a post where you can vent your frustration over not receiving the upcoming patch yet. Feel free to talk about what content you hope to see in the game, what the new heroes might be like, etc.

I personally hope that Sir Pangolin gets a Q much like Troll's, except it changes his main attribute instead of being ranged/melee. His W and E would be an active and a passive which are different for each attribute.

**EDIT:** Apparently, there has been a leak about heroes getting 5 talents (instead of 4) and an Aghs rework (with every missing hero being given an upgrade). The Aghs rework is interesting and frightening at the same time. Reducing its cost or increasing its benefits (stats wise) could make it a much more popular item. (That's an Alch buff for you.)

**EDIT2:** This thread wasn't started because there was information about the patch coming soon. It's precisely because we have no idea that there's a waiting room.~|discussion

7 Reasons why an in-client community guild system is exactly the thing DotA needs right now.|self.DotA2|~1: DotA has become an increasingly team-oriented experience. Playing solo has become less and less fun because you're dealing with 9 random factors that have a huge influence on your game. A guild system would provide a way for people to finally find others to consistently play with, lowering this feeling of randomness and helplessness.

2: Guilds offer a wide array of services that normal MM can't. Things like role-based partying, leaderboards, small tourneys, guild matchmaking, etc.

3: A stronger sense of community. People are much more likely to become attached to their guilds than they are to the game itself.

4: More competitive games, both within the guild as well as guild vs. guild. People can finally form 5 man teams and try out the strategies/playstyles they see the pros doing.

5: Potential for pro-scene growth. If properly run and implemented, Guilds can offer a reliable way for players to get noticed and gain respect, as they are smaller communities that get to see first-hand a player's/team's skill.

6: Growth for other aspects of the game, such as Custom Games. Guild members can advertise their custom games among their guilds, and guilds can organize players for them. 

7: Less toxicity. Players are held accountable for their actions in guilds, because they're playing with similar people who can remember their actions. 

Let me know if you have any other ideas to add.
