You don't deserve DotA|self.DotA2|~All these entitled whiny punks on reddit don't know how great this game is. Always complaining about the lack of content and how delayed battlepass, arcana, or some other bullshit is. People on here daily saying that the game is boring and there's nothing to do. What the fuck are you expecting to do other than play dota? Why are you starting up dota to jerk your dick to a new crystal maiden skin? If you want to do quests go play WoW. The happiest these fucks have been in the last year is when you could see QoPs tits take up half the fucking screen on your profile page. Why are you even playing this game?

Like seriously, I cringe every time I read something like "there isn't anything to do in this game anymore, that's why it's dying". Just the other day I was down at the local bball court and people were like "man there's nothing to do here anymore, I need some incentive to play pickup games." Nah, just kidding that didn't happen, they're there to play fucking basketball not whine about how nike announced that they'd release a michael jordan arcana 204 days ago. They're there to ball, blow off steam, fucking school some kids.

That's the same reason 95% of us play dota. We just wanna style on some mother fuckers, pull off some cool moves, and get completely absorbed in a fun ass game. Balance changes don't affect us much at all. 99% of you bitches will continue to do the exact same things you did before a patch with zero thought as to how it impacts your ability to win. Yet you go on reddit like you're some fucking godlike analyst saying how we have shit patches and balance changes that make no sense. None of you have any fucking clue what you're talking about.

Back in my day you had to install a third party program to fake a lan game just to get something that resembled a decent match. And even then you'd get a leaver like 25% of the time. But you know what, we put up with it. Because we loved playing dota. Now all people want is for Valve to cash in on the community's creation and waste time on shit like cosmetics and quests. Yeah, fuck that. Go play league if you want to shell out 10% of your measly peon income every month for cartoon tits and cringy cosmetics. The rest of us will be enjoying the masterpiece that is dota 2.

So please, kindly fuck off with your asinine suggestions and stop asking for things that are at best tangential to the dota experience and at worst detrimental to its core. Go to an art museum if you want some cosmetics. Get a job if you want some quests. Play dota if you want to play some fucking dota. I know that's what I'll be doing.

7.00 is killing my custom game and I can't do anything about it|self.DotA2|~I've put a lot of work into my game: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=473718711

Over more than a year I've developed a unique ranked system, rewards system, custom game pass system and now it's all going to the trash bin because after 7.00 90% of players experience a crash after the game ends. Which means they will never see their rank progression or their custom game pass level progression.

I know only a week has passed, but I'm losing players every day, and you know what happens to games with no players: they die.

Players also report frequent crashes on selecting units (which I have never messed with) or even simply going to dashboard and back. And since the game is so short players never come back to play another one after a crash.

It's disheartening to see my creation die while being absolutely helpless.

EDIT: to any of you people telling me to fix it myself I've recorded a little footage just now. I've been trying to locate the bug for the last 20 hours and there it is: https://my.mixtape.moe/xacebu.webm

As far as I've got it trying to load any 3D model into UI (in this case monkey king preview from dashboard) at this point will make the game crash. I have a ton of 3D models in the UI before but they do not crash the game. There are specific preconditions which I don't understand and which I seemingly can't fix. It also seems like that can happen earlier in the game.~|personal

Thank You|self.DotA2|~Just wanted to write a small bit expressing my gratitude to everyone especially Valve for letting me participate in the main stage of this years TI.

The last two years have been a bit of a slump for me in terms of casting and overall mentality, I appreciate those of you who stuck with me through it to get me here.

Casting with Owen is always fantastic and being on the panel with people like Winter and Black is enlightening to say the least.  I feel hungry to improve and hopefully be back again next year!

Feel free to leave any criticisms if you like, today I'm just happy to be a part of this community.

Edit: To the guy who asked for my new twitter its @DraskylDotaTwo and yes, I know it's a terrible name 3:

Edit 2: I didn't really expect this level of response, but I really do appreciate it and will take into account the criticism some of you had for my fatalistic way of viewing the game.  Hope to see you guys soon!~|personal esports
Got angry at a nice guy in chat, realized something pretty heavy.|self.DotA2|~Basically, we were getting stomped. Nice guy, we'll call Frak, was doing poorly. So was I. I was 0-7, him 1-6. Basically, I die a couple times in lane with him, him as Bane, me as Drow.

I get pissed off in chat and talk down to him, insult him, generally I just act like an angry douchebag. He never responds back, he either stays silent or just says "Sorry" or similar stuff. Soon, I stop trash talking him. I calm down in about 3 or 4 minutes. 

As our last towers got smashed down by their team, I felt awful for what I said. I got angry and stupid because I was losing. He was actually doing better than me, and my deaths were my fault. And I dragged a nice person through the dirt for it. I go into chat and say "Bane, I'm really sorry for what I said. I'm doing worse than you, and I had no place to say what I said. You're doing better, and I'm really sorry."

He says "It's okay man. I'd be angry too." I'm glad he's accepted my apology. I say "Thanks for not being like me". Then it hit me that I just typed that. I was relieved and thankful that someone was behaving other than how *I* behave. 

I actually stopped playing for a few seconds when it hit me. I was toxic and generally a bad player, sometimes I was *that* player. I said sorry again, and he was fine with it. We lost the game, me and him exchanging "gg"'s and "nice jobs"'s. 

I'm going to stop getting angry now. I need to behave nicely and treat other players how I'd like to be treated. I'd just like to share this with you guys, as it really opened my eyes. ~|personal
My girlfriend and I met in a dota pub 2 years ago today...|self.DotA2|~She picked offlane OD and I was safelane DK with my friend supporting me (it was 2k mmr). Having identified she was a grill I proceeded to capslock flame her all game and suicide to the enemy fountain to prove my devotion to her. Somehow it worked and we added each other. A month later I was on the plane from the UK to Romania to meet her. 4 months later we went to Fiji together for 2 weeks. 6 months later she moved to England, got a job and we have lived together for over a year now. We still play dotes and tonight will play offlane OD and safelane DK in a pub to celebrate. Though now we are over 4k mmr I think that won't end well...

Tonight, 2 years and +2,000 mmr each later, we're celebrating our 2nd anniversary! Dota is true romance.

Reddit you are the only place that can help me get my masters degree, please help!|self.DotA2|~Edit: Thank you all for participating, sadly Im getting spammed by some bots so I will stop taking more answers. My aim was to get 200 answers and I got more than 6000 so give yourself a clap,Im very thankful. Results will be posted here during May.

Also thanks to all your wishes and positivity, /r/dota2 you have saved me :)

Hello Reddit,

I need your help. 

Last year in August I did a short survey about last years Battle Pass. I have gotten more then 12 000 answers. With so many responses my professor who is the head of my study was really surprised and finally excited about my thesis. My thesis is about crowdfunding as a form of alternative financing for The International. So I have made second survey. This survey is better for analysis and better to draw conclusions from. 

We have agreed with my professor that I will need at least 200 answers for this survey, which seemed like no problem, based on previous survey. I have created a long form survey and posted it here and to other sides such as Dotabuff and Dota 2 forum on steam, but I didnt get more than 15 replies. (PepeHands) Ive deleted the old survey and created a shorter version of it, by removing few questions and now Im here.

Im in really dire situation right now and only YOU can save me. Please, I beg you please fill this survey and share it to help me achieve my goal of 200 responses. This survey is really important and its results will more or less decide if I even get my degree since its a big part of my finals. I hope that r/dota2 will safe me.

Link to the survey: 
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiRiQH7SFqYh-_AdskXCzEkHIwdTRKWI-GJ_wWd_4g66j8tA/viewform

Thank you for reading and have a great day

TLDR: I have problem to repeat success of survey that focuses on Battle Pass and TI, I may not get my diploma if I fail. Please help me with survey

My friend is missing. Dota2 was an extremely big part of his life in the past 5 years and we think somebody from his former team might have a clue as to where he is. Here's his old team, can you identify the players and maybe provide contact info for them?|self.DotA2|~**Resolution:** Misho contacted another of his friends. He is now at home, safe and sound. Thank you very much for all the positive wishes and thoughts!  

-----
~~~~**UPDATE:** I have reason to believe another of Misho's friends is in contact with him. Hopefully he is well.  
**UPDATE2:** Misho contacted another of his friends. He is not in the country, but seems okay. We've sent him money and we are hoping he uses them to come home. At least now we know he is okay.~~~~  
  
  
  
------------
~~~~[Here](http://i.imgur.com/xvMdcq1.jpg) is a photo of his former team - Rize Gaming. They won a tournament back in October '16. It was [epicLAN 19](https://www.epiclan.co.uk/epic19), my friend is the one holding the poster (second from right to left).~~~~  
  
~~~~I'm looking for any contact information about these players: RizeGaming: Ouker, got_lyrics, crusHdota, spokey~~~~  
  
~~~~My friend has been missing with no note for ~~40 hours now and we are thinking he might have told some of his old teammates something that would give us a clue.  
Any help is appreciated.~~~~  
  
  
~~~~PS: His nick in the tournament apparently was ntngspcl, he used to also go by "[nothingspec1al](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/players/51874-nothingspec1al)". I think he did frequent this subreddit, so - **Misho, if you are reading this, please send a text to your mom that you are okay. Both her and your father are very worried and are not mad about anything at all.**~~~~
  
~~~~PS2: Forgot to mention - he is born in Bulgaria and lived here, but we are not sure if he's left the country. The police are helpless on that one since many people travel within the EU with no record of them doing so.~~~~  
  
~~~~**Edit:** I have spoken to Ouker, but unfortunately he doesn't have more information. I am waiting for the other 3 players to come online to speak with them. It seems many of you think we have not involved the police, which is false.  
**Edit2:** I have spoken to spokey as well. CrusHdota has also added me and I have yet to speak with him and got_lyrics. Still no update.~~~~  ~|personal

I will never reach 9k MMR, but this right here is the most significant thing I'll ever have in my Dota career|i.redd.it||personal esports
I learned a lot by talking to a lady outside of TI|self.DotA2|~She's an older lady, but she says she's been doing her job for all the TIs. At TIs, she said she's the one who meets the players at the airports, she also waits for them outside the player entrances and helps coordinate the busses as well.  

It's my first TI, and I actually just came to her for help (asking about Fisher lawn, where the players enter, etc.) and we ended up talking for a long time. She told me about how Dendi was really nice to her, and she was sad he couldn't come to this TI. She also talked about Loda, but she actually referred to him as Jonathan, his first name.  

When Team Empire arrived yesterday, Resolution jumped out of the bus incredibly energized, running around. The first thing he did was run up to this lady and hug her. It was so sweet. She said Dendi would do that too.  

I wish I could have talked to her more. Yesterday she was standing outside of the press entrance. She enjoys talking and helping out others.

"C9. DD: The believerboy". "Brother of EternaLEnVy" Lmaooo, the shitposter!!! People thought I was joking, but they underestimated me. I have power of the gods, similar to EternaLEnVys strengths. They can't be studied. You're born with them.

For my friend|teamliquid.net||personal
No, unless you're Merlini|self.DotA2|~Merlini holds a special place in our hearts for varying reasons, and I want to share why he means so much to me even though he doesn't know it.

A friend and I started playing dota about 12 years ago, around the 6.34b era iirc. We used to go to our favourite lan cafe and just play casual 2v2s, 3v3s etc. Living in Pakistan, we didn't know of any professional scene in this game. In fact we never even considered that there could be real 'pro players' in gaming. We used to browse dota-allstars quite a bit though. I remember a post asking whether jungle Juggernaut could be viable. I remember an exact reply to that post: 'No, unless you're Merlini'.

That was the turning point. Who is Merlini? Is he just another random player? Why does this guy know his name? I told my friend about it and we started searching for 'Merlini dota' and were just blown away. We found his legendary Zeus triple kill on shaker, venge and leshrac with insane tango-tree play and clarity usage. We found his Rexxar jungling guide and found out this dude has invented a new way to play. We found out that he actually plays in a professional team called Meet Your Makers!

We found out about gg-no-re and started downloading MYM vs VP games. No casting, sometimes a guy called inde_ed with a Gordon Freeman avatar would have casted a game very casually. We were just amazed at this new world we didn't even know existed. Soon we were following the pro scene religiously. A couple of years later we were over the moon  when we found out a fellow Pakistani and friend amartnt got the chance to play competitively in Kuroky's team!

It was a crazy time for us, and we grew up with it. Not many folks here knew the pro scene but we used to sit in my friend's room downloading replays and just watching in awe at these amazing players from MYM and VP. Vigoss, Ars-Art, NS, Admir, Jolie, Sahka, Merlini, Maelk, H4nni, Mania, Slahser, Levent. And other 'random' players like JollyJoker (all chat master), US|Wedge (techies pro), hitomi (Rhashta specialist), Loda (farming god and inventor of the deny), pink priestess (MYM girls team) and quite a few more.

Our love for this game grew exponentially because of these times and the memories we have are priceless. And it all began from a simple sentence: 'No, unless you're Merlini'.

Today we are much older, are married and live in different countries. We'll maybe play a game together once every two months. But we still follow the professional scene religiously. And every now and then we remember those awesome times and we remember Merlini and his jungling and his zeus. Our origins.

So Merlini, I can not thank you enough. I just want to let you know how much you have contributed to this game and how you have made so many people's lives that much better. We all wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors and salute you for your contribution to this game we all love.

tl:dr; gtg exam! (MYM vs VP reference)~|personal
Please don't tell people to kill themselves. It's not a joke. RIP...|self.DotA2|~I played a low priority game a while ago with [this guy Stephan](http://www.dotabuff.com/players/62567), and he sent me a friend request after. I didn't accept it because he was on the other team that destroyed me, and I figured he just wanted to talk shit. But I guess I'll never know.

Some time in late September he changed his name to 'Committing suicide, Farewell'. Pretty disturbing but I didn't think much of it, figuring he wasn't being serious; just BabyRaging and being emo. But morbid curiosity made me keep checking his profile, and I noticed that he was not playing. A few weeks go by, and his name is changed to 'Stephan Dad plz msg info RIPoct2'. On his profile I see a few comments from others paying their respects. The guy actually killed himself. 

According to his [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/soliveira_) he lost his job recently and decided to just start streaming. He was obviously going through a rough time, (as many people who consume themselves with dota/video games are) and felt he had only one way out.

I'm not really sure what the point of this post is. I just needed to tell someone because it's really been bothering me. I didn't know him, but honestly, it's just really gut-wrenching and makes me feel sick that he was serious and this actually happened. I found out a few days ago and I've been thinking about it a lot. Maybe if I accepted his friend request and we became pals this wouldn't have happened. I guess I just wana say that guys, you never know what someone's going though. It can be hard to remember that the people you're in game with are actual human beings with real problems and feelings. Maybe you're going through a tough time too. Its so easy to just be rude and flame and say terrible things from behind your computer screen that you probably don't mean but those things could seriously hurt someone. We can all try a bit harder to be more considerate of our fellow players, whoever they are and wherever they may be from. I know I will. 

RIP Stephan.

Statement regarding speculation around Ana situation.|self.DotA2|~Ive repressed my feelings on the subject since January and was essentially forced to leave it and move on due to a mixture of personal hurt, a busy schedule and lifes many other priorities. Regrettably, the attention this situation has generated in addition to blatant speculation of my character in a public podcast streamed on twitch, youtube, and multiple Reddit threads have forced me into compiling this evidence to establish the facts and timeline of events.



Facts and timeline

* Conversations with Anas brother that shows I started talking to Anas family regarding professional esports back in 2014. https://imgur.com/a/8O3li


* This is my wife writing a sponsorship/invitation letter for Ana to apply for a VISA for entry and stay in Shanghai. https://imgur.com/a/oCSMG

* This shows a small portion of dialogue that proves I did, in fact, negotiate Ana onto OG. There are a lot more negotiations (not only on twitter) but I do not want to disclose any more private conversations than I need to out of respect for Tal (OG.Fly). https://imgur.com/a/ISSVZ

* This is a skype log between an OG player and myself, it details the story from my side so I dont have to rewrite it again. Identity is blurred out of respect for that person. Please do note that when I have contacted players regarding this drama I made sure it is at a time that they are not playing any major tournaments as to not affect their performance. https://imgur.com/a/t7LBn

* Here is a chat log where Ana acknowledges my being his agent/manager and also that I suspected he and his family may betray me by not honoring their end of the deal. https://imgur.com/a/JefwL

* This is the contract I signed with Ana after leaving IG and before even negotiating with OG (Please note the timestamp of contract as well as the timestamps on the twitter messages with OG.Fly). https://imgur.com/a/qq5qa

    Please note that the contract expires on Anas 18th birthday, not 50 years as some people have speculated.
 
    Finally, the first agreement we agreed to before signing IG was with a 30% fee, but because he found success much earlier than I had anticipated (Winning NEA), I offered to lower it without Ana or his mother asking and re-entered the agreement with my fee lowered considerably to 10%. 

* This is an email transcript between OG manager and myself. https://imgur.com/a/jtfJx

* Aggrieved by the situation at hand, I was constrained to send this letter of demand to Ana and his mom. https://imgur.com/a/wdGVH

* Ive linked the TI player profile for Ana you can see my involvement in Anas quick rise to stardom has been completely omitted. To my surprise, it was made to appear like they have always been supportive and that IG reached out to Ana on their own. Moreover, Anas mum says that Shanghai is her hometown and thats why she sent him, however, instead of staying with family, Ana stayed with me under my care, guidance, and supervision. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h93757dO6DE


I wish I could go back in time and not have to go through any of this, I cant help but feel betrayed after all the work I put in only to be ignored for such a little sum of money. I was blocked since January this year and in that time I have quit Dota2, I didnt even watch TI since I knew Ana would be competing.  

I like to think I am a reasonable guy, all I want is Ana to honor the original agreement and an apology. Every cent received by me minus legal fees will go to either a charity of /r/dota2s choice or a players-only tournament in which we can discover new talented players to join the pro dota2 scene (No established pros allowed).

A lot of readers, especially the Chinese fans of dota2 have speculated and attacked my character because I defended Anas rights against IG. I just want to express that as Anas then manager/agent I acted on Anas best interest and that the issue is now resolved.

Ana, I know you are reading this and probably wont reach out to me. I hope you can grow from this and I wish you the best of luck in future endeavors.

I am d2bowie and this is my ti7 project|self.DotA2|~Hi everyone!

 You probably never heard my name but saw one of my videos [miracle am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RaH2wsv1zU) , [zai pudge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBb-PK8iNO0) , [burning pa](https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=OR1kQciG0c4), **i mainly produce educative/tutorial videos about dota**.



It's been one year since i've started this journey. I gave up chemical engineering (mainly because being an engineer in brazil is actually working in an office 90% of the time) but also because my family couldn't afford me living in another town because of my grandpa getting sick and my pops lost his job. **i always had this creative side of me that i was never able to explore and having to get back to my parents house gave me a lot of time to spend doing content**. 

This grew enough that i was able to move away from my parents house and work 100% in my yt channel. It's been almost one year since that happened and while i feel really grateful and accomplished with myslef i never attended TI. This is probably one of my biggest dreams and **while attending TI in itself is great i actually want to be there to produce the best content possible**. 

I am crowdfunding this project so that i can bring someone with me to film it. Everything is throughly explained in the [indiegogo page i created](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/i-want-bowie-to-make-content-for-ti7-in-seatle-games/x/16740549#/)

**If you want a not so quick tldr:**
---
**Plans before TI**

Produce videos talking about the first invited teams strategy/style/mannerisms . They would be done in a way that everyone can understand and aim at give that 5 min explanation for the casual viewer to what each team is about.

---

**Plans during TI**

I will do everything i possibly can to give an overview of what ti is about. Vlogs/videos/interviews . This part is kinda tricky because getting interviews with well known players is hard, specially when you're a no one like i am. One of the reasons i'm posting this on reddit is to maybe get enough exposure to do that.

The interviews though will try to get a different angle of the pro players than we usually see. I feel like a lot of the awkwardness that comes with player interviews is usually talking too much about personal life/ why did you win or lose .**I would like to ask more questions about the game , something they are clearly passionate about.** I know they won't talk about strats , but i never saw anyone asking pros about tips to winning ranked games, what do they think about an enemies strat and stuff like that.
**I would also like to do some sort of comparisson between the pannels opinnion on certain games and what the average ti viewer thinks about it, there's a lot of cool things that can be done**.

---


**Plans after TI**
I would love to produce very well thought videos about every game of the finals in the usually timely friendly manner that i approach my own videos. I feel like there's a lot of content being made today but they are either too long and not planned or they are old. 

**Another plan i have (if this gets enough exposure) is have a compilation of pro players talking about different aspects of the finals and why they think "x" worked or not. Instead of just 747 or ppd talking about it we would have a great video with a lot of different insight**. I feel like the only barrier to this part is this getting big since with ti ending most pros wouldn't hold their opinions (the patch will probably change a lot after it).

---

This actually turned out way bigger than i expected.  **I want to do this even if the project doesn't get entirely funded. Still though, it wouldn't be possible for me to pay for the expenses of both the other person and myself.** (I also don't have ti tickets, which at this point seems like a small problem). If this idea seems cool , if you like my videos or the content i produce and you already bought all the compendium levels you wished i would be more than happy with any help! 

EDIT: I never expected so much response for this. I am so anxious that i couldn't sleep since i posted this and it was already super late when i decided to . I'm streaming trying to relax and see if i can get back to [sleeping](https://www.twitch.tv/d2bowi3) . Thanks everyone :)~|personal
With the TI6 main event about 10 hours away, I wanted to share my TI "Core Memories" with you|self.DotA2|~Greetings and **EXTREMELY LONG POST AHEAD WARNING**, Dota fans!

Over the past week or so, as I've been reading through all of the threads and discussions about TI6, I've caught myself acting like the old man I am... meaning I've been leaving many comments about the way-back-when days, sharing memories and spinning yarns. And inevitably as I've shared those thoughts and experiences, even more have come to mind. Going back in time and remembering that part of my life has brought me a lot of bittersweet joy. Now with the main event only a handful of hours away, I can't think of a better time to share my TI core memories with you, given that all of you have been there with me every step of the way.

If I'm honest, there's also an emotional healing element to all of this which will be made clear by the end. There are a lot of things involving the family nature of GoodGame, Evil Geniuses, and Alliance and how tight nit we are which I think the community will appreciate.

I've decided to skip stories about commentating particular games or series, and except in cases where exceptions are obvious, anything about gameplay/results as a whole. Most people have seen those moments. At any rate, I hope you enjoy... I know I did, through the ups and downs alike.

**TI2**

---

**First time walking into TI**

* I had only been playing Dota for eight months and casting it for five when I arrived in Seattle and walked into Benaroya to cast TI2 at the invitation of IceFrog. I toddled into that foyer with the awkwardness of a kid on his first day at a new school. I walked up to the first group of people I spotted wearing Valve shirts, stuck out my hand, and said "Hi, I'm Ayesee." Doug Wood of Valve turned and said, "I recognize that voice!" Afterward, I introduced myself to Tobi, who went out of his way to guide me around and introduce me to all of the other casters, hosts, and panelists who'd go on to be some of my best friends and favorite people in the world. [I'll always be thankful to him for that](http://i.imgur.com/DSRLUqA.jpg).

**Meeting Gabe Newell**

* Second day I was there, before the event even started, sitting down in the cafeteria/green room area used by talent and staff by myself drinking a diet coke. In walks Gabe, who sits down RIGHT beside me. Starstruck, I stuck out my hand and said, "Hey Mr. Newell, I'm Aaron..." and he shook my hand and said "Of course I know you, you're Ayesee." To this day, I have no words to describe that feeling. It wasn't pride. It was something closer to humility mixed with validation. Feeling humbled that you were given the chance to do the work you do, intertwined with a feeling of graciousness that you'd done something right to be alive in that experience.

**My first real Greetings and Salutations**

* Sure, I'd said it hundreds (if not thousands) of times on stream before... but saying those words live to a packed audience at a million dollar tournament, in a moment that represented a genuine dream come true is just... well, different. Yes, I had worked in radio for years, but in radio you're alone in a small studio, you can't feel or see your audience. Staring out over the sea of people, it hit me - hundreds of thousands of people were at home, and thousands were in front of me, waiting for me to be a voice for their memories of this moment. My hands started to shake, my chest started to tremble. I heard the producer in my ear say "GO COMMENTATORS," and as if someone had hit a button, I bellowed out my greetings... and the crowd roared in response. I've never been nervous in front of an audience since that moment.

**Meeting Alex Garfield**

* After TI2 I was milling around the lobby while the DJ spun his tunes for the after party, when a guy in an EG shirt came up to me and asked what I thought of the event. I didn't recognize him, but he had the most profound look of focus and understanding in his eyes. Everything about him screamed "this seems like a cool guy." We talked and shot the shit about the event, the matches, etc until a Team Liquid writer interrupted us. He said "I see what's going on! Trying to hire Ayesee!" I put the pieces together and realized it was THE Alex Garfield, a man I only knew as a name. I started working for EG/GGA the next month, and moved out to SF to work on site full time 8 months later - one of the first 8 founding members of our home office in the Bay. Alex's belief in me changed my life beyond my wildest dreams, and the moments we've shared together... you can't imagine. More on those later.

**TI3**

---

**Late night soccer at the Westin**

* I don't play soccer. I don't like soccer. But I'll always remember this moment because of how it sums up people who work in eSports - serious, driven individuals... who are just kids at heart. I remember coming back to the Westin very late one of the nights of the main event. I went up to the ballrooms marked off for talent to relax/eat/drink with hopes for a nightcap. What I found was a full blown game of soccer taking place in the large open area in front of the ballrooms. Almost everyone still awake was playing. I sat down, watched, and commentated. Maybe you had to be there, but it was... something special.

**Alliance wins the Grand Finals**

* I got to be that fanboy in the Alliance box, during the Grand Finals, surrounded by the friends and coworkers I loved the most. The end... the dream coil... the moment that ancient exploded. You could give me 10,000 words, and I still couldn't capture it. I remember Cody Connors jumped on my back and I jumped up and down with him ON my back. I remember I was standing right next to Alex, and he literally almost fainted - eyes fluttered and he stumbled backwards against the wall, lmao. I grabbed him, hugged him, and lifted him off the ground with tears in my eyes. We all hugged everyone else we could get our hands on, then Alex, myself, and Sean Green (GGA photographer) ran as quickly as we could down from the balcony to backstage. We were there waiting to greet our boys as soon as they walked off stage. More tears. More hugs. Everything from there is a blur - we hung around, talked and laughed, then as a group we all went to dinner... with the Aegis sitting in the middle of the table. Somewhere on someone's cell phone exists a picture of Alex and I holding the aegis together at that dinner.

---

**TI4**

---

**Not doing the main stage**

* TI4 was hard for me in a lot of ways... really hard. As a member of GGA, my day to day life and work responsibilities began to pivot away from simply casting Dota, to being a part of much larger projects in much more impactful roles. I was doing more work in eSports than ever... but doing less casting. By the time TI4 invites were set to go out, I knew there was a chance I wouldn't be asked to do the main stage that year. Which is what ended up happening. I was devastated. Like, didn't leave the house for days devastated. And being physically present at TI4 in that diminished role wasn't any easier. Even though I didn't know it at the time, that pain I was feeling was the pain of change, resulting from slow evolutions happening inside me as a person and involving me in the industry. I just wasn't ready for it. Looking back, those memories are still hard... but they were inevitable. And what got me through it was the endless support I got from Dota fans all over the world, both online and in person at that event. Thank you. You know who you are. Ultimately, even though I didn't know it at the time, my efforts and energy being required for other projects turned out to be my small part to play in our acquisition by Twitch, which was already in the works. I just didn't know that until much later.

**Getting to know the item creators**

* You know those awesome people who make the hats that keep this whole TI thing growing year after year? Listen closely when I tell you this: they are some of the most talented, funny, intelligent people you'll ever meet... and some of my favorite people in the whole world. This was the year I really got to know them - Manny, Anuxi, Danidem, Thiago, Terracotta, the list goes on and on. I've spent more nights than I can count at dinner, in bars, in hotel rooms, on rooftops, and just wandering the streets partying with these amazing folks. And no matter how many times we get together, I'm sad when we have to say goodbye and can't wait for the next chance to say hello. I'm sure some of you are reading this - please know, I love you. And you've all helped me get through some of the hardest times in my life... this year, and especially around TI5. 

---

**TI5**

---

**Note:** TI5 is hard of me to write about. Just typing that sentence has tears welling up in my eyes. It was the single most emotionally violent and turbulent period of my life I'd ever experienced. Low, to high, to low, to high again... to the lowest I've ever been. I don't know how to list these events except sequentially. I've never shared them before with anyone outside of closest friends and family... but if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do it right. The formatting for this section is a little different so bare with me.

**My first TI on the sidelines**

Title says it all. This was the first year I wasn't invited to participate in a TI as talent. If you've read this far, and read the experiences above, you can imagine how hard this was for me. By that time, though, my life had changed so much that I knew it was the next step in my transition from "Ayesee, the Dota caster" to "Ayesee, the eSports industry professional who still casts Dota when he can." Thankfully, I once again had the full GGA family around me to help me remember that while a part of my life had been left behind, it was another step towards the future.

**My Father, Ronald Chambers**

EG was in the Grand Finals. The whole gang was there. The GGA suite was packed with almost every person who was or had ever been a part of GGA... who'd ever been an Evil Genius. I can look at this moment, surrounded by all those people I was lucky enough to have in my life, all of us sharing this moment together, as one of the most profound I'd ever experienced.

EG had just won game 1 against CDEC, and we were all riding on a high that can't be comprehended. I ducked outside for some air and sunshine, and my phone rang - it was my parents calling. I answered, excited at their timing, as I could tell them all about the event so far and that our team was winning! We were THIS CLOSE to Evil Geniuses - to OUR TEAM - being TI5 champions!

I answered practically shaking with excitement. Mom knew all about EG and Dota and my work. I couldn't wait to tell her. Mom said hello, and I stammered out "Hey mom, guess what! We're doing it! EG is in the Grand Finals!" But she interrupted me. My father, who'd been having serious health problems for the last five years, had collapsed earlier that morning, and been taken to the hospital. He was in a coma. And they weren't sure if he would ever wake up.

I don't know how to verbally describe a moment like that. Every word or phrase that comes to mind feels cheap. So I'm not going to even try. I wept, and I almost fell over. I couldn't stand up without leaning on something.

I honestly don't remember what I asked her, and what she told me in specific. Just vague notions we communicated back and forth. He was in a coma, and it'd be a day or two before we knew if he had the possibility to wake up or not. He was on life support. There was nothing I could do. Nothing she could do.

I told her I was going to fly home immediately. She told me no, that I should stay. He was breathing on life support, and that wasn't going to change. If he woke up in the mean time, everything would be okay. If he didn't, that wasn't going to change by me being there. I was completely stunned. I told her I had to come home. What she said next shocked me:

"No, baby. You go win. It's what Dad would want."

And she was right. Ever since I left my old business and moved home to help her take care of Dad full time in 2011, he'd been my rock and biggest motivator. During that time, I lived with her and Dad, and did side radio/broadcasting jobs and worked in eSports to earn money. I'd take care of him most of the time, then broadcast Dota and do other eSports work in between. And while she was always supportive, it was Dad that asked me every day about eSports - about Dota, about this crazy industry I was trying to break into. It was him that, when I was invited to cast TI2, called my friends over to help him figure out how to watch me cast on his potato computer. It was him that used that potato computer to look up and read articles about Evil Geniuses and Alliance, even though he had almost no idea what he was reading... he just knew it was our teams. He knew we were Evil Geniuses. It was him that cried tears of joy when I told him I was moving to San Francisco to work in this industry full time. It was him that made me who I am today.

He was my biggest fan.

So I listened to him, and to my mother, and stayed.

**Circle the wagons**

It's a cliche, but in this case, it's true. So many of my memories about this final day are a blur - a lot of hazy images and feelings, with extremely bright and clear moments woven in. I remember going back to the GGA suite, a crying mess, and not knowing what to do but seek out Alex and Colin DeShong (GGA COO, my mentor, and my very good friend) and tell them what had happened, and that depending on when my mother called back with news, I may have to fly out on very short notice.

They barely said a word. Just hugged me, and didn't let go until I was done with needing to be hugged. Which, bless their hearts, took a while. This continued with every person in the box. Dozens of them.

They then took me up to the front row of seats in the box, and parked my ass between them. And we cheered on Evil Geniuses to victory.

**Prologue**

The day I arrived back in SF from TI, I got another call from my mother. My father was never going to wake up. I told Colin I had to leave immediately. He told me they were paying for mine and Sherry's (my GF) flights home, and that there was no date I was expected to be back. To take as long as I needed. They only wanted to hear from me if there was anything I needed, even if it was just to talk.

My father passed away on August 13th, 2015. This year's grand finals will be one year, to the day, since he passed.

I stayed home for 2-3 weeks. When I finally came back, once again it was GGA who booked my flights. And they flew us first class - the one and only time I've flown first class.

I came back to the office still a wreck, but wanted to achieve some degree of normalcy. I walked in and headed back towards our area of Twitch. I saw Alex sitting in a booth in the cafeteria with his earbuds in working on his laptop - I didn't think he saw me and he looked busy, so I walked on past.

I hadn't taken 10 more steps when I felt a hand on my shoulder - Alex had spotted me and chased me down. He hugged me and welcomed me back, and shared some words that are just for he and I.

I walked on back to our area, and was similarly welcomed back by everyone. Then, I spotted a big picture frame on my desk. 

[At the direction of Alex and Colin, GGA commissioned a very special painting for me.](http://i.imgur.com/WDA7Z3n.jpg)

At the bottom left is my father and I. Middle, the TI5 stage. The sides, my two favorite and most played Dota characters. On the back are lot of signatures and messages, most of which are too personal to share.

It's the single most valuable material possession I've ever owned.

**Thanks**

I'd imagine not many made it this far, but if you have, there they are... my TI core memories. Concerning the emotional stuff at the end, that's the healing I was talking about... and more than anything, I wanted everyone to understand how special of an organization GGA has been over the years. I couldn't have survived without them. All of these memories have been made possible by you, the Dota fans. And it's my pleasure to share them with you, the way you all so often share your own with me.

This year will be a little hard for me after TI5, and because of other changes that I can't get into. But this year will be Sherry's first eSports event ever... not a bad one to start with, huh? She'll be there with me. I hope some of you will come say hello.

Thank you, Dota community members, for allowing my life to be made up of these moments. Thank you Valve and all your staffers, for how amazingly helpful and supportive you've always been, allowing me to be a part of this historic community you've created. Thank you IceFrog, for giving an unknown commentator from West Virginia a chance. Thank you to every commentator, host, player, and personality, for letting me be a part of this special group with you.

Thank you Alex and Colin, for believing in me and making me an Evil Genius - and for being the most supportive friends for which I could ever ask. Thank you everyone at GGA for being my family in the only ways that matter. Thank you to my mother and the rest of my family, for everything.

Thank you, Dad.~|personal esports

Hey everyone BigDaddyN0tail here: )|self.DotA2|~Hello!

I've been wanting to do a statement for a while regarding the shuffle, and why I am no longer on Team Secret, but I've been very busy with Christmas, New Years and I've been thinking a lot about what to say.

Let me take you back to the very beginning of this team. Myself and Kuro were talking together in Seattle after TI4. We got along very well, and still do, but at the time we were unhappy with how things had went in the past, Dota related.

Talks kept happening and we ended up deciding on forming a team together with a very specific idea in mind. This would be a winning team, a team built to win. If a problem would occur within the team the problem would be solved within the team, if that's turns out not to be possible the team would fix it the other way (i.e. roster replacements).
And that's what has happened this last month and a half.

I have a very good relationship with everyone remaining in secret, there is not a single ounce of bad blood between us and I don't see a reason for there to be any. The decision to remove me and misery for Zai and Arteezy I completely understand, I would be stupid if I don't get the reasoning behind this decision. They're very talented players and there were some issues within the team, although minor issues, the team thinks it can do better with this change.

For the people following the scene closely, you will have already seen I found my place in the Cloud9 team and I am very positive about what we can accomplish, but that post is for another time :)

The main point of this post is to remove any negativity towards any of these players that jumped teams, whether its Secret, EG or C9.

We are just young boiz that wanna play doto ^^

Thanks for reading, enjoy the scene and don't make it worse!~|personal esports
I'm paralysed all the way down from my shoulder and today I beat my personal Mount Everest|i.redd.it||personal
Dear SingSing|self.DotA2|~Hi


I make a new account every time I use Reddit, which is around once every 3 - 6 months, basically only when I have a burning question. Well, this is my latest throwaway that I could remember its login details.


This one is for my friend, Gordon. Gordon was an avid follower of Dota 2, and, also, of r/dota2. But as of 4 days ago, Gordon was no more. What was a decent-looking guy studying his ass of in grad school, with glimmering eyes and a dazzling smile, is now a flat line and a constant deafening sound from the machine that is supposed to tell you good news.


Aneurysm. You get one warning. A red line. That's what he told me when he was lucky enough to survive the first one. Afterwards, he lost parts of his memory, was not the same person anymore, and he was laughing hysterically and uncontrollably, when his countdown popped. He got no second warning.


I guess this is my form of raging and ranting so as to fix the mess of emotions that I am in right now, or whatever. I don't know. But when Gordon was here, he was probably the number 1 fan of SingSing, and probably for the same reason people like him for: his relaxed attitude, his troll builds, his goofiness, and an overall optimistic and/or salty outlook on his games.


After the first one struck and he had to go to the hospital, he became almost another person. His movements were jittery, his moods swung wildly, he couldn't control his emotions. He would log onto Dota, play well or badly, flame his teammates, then instantly apologise relentlessly, at times bursting into tears. He loses it. And he gets it. He knows that it's happening to him. Somehow he knows that he was, minutes ago, laughing, but now he's all in tears. And the people, man. The people. When your teammates flame you and then literally cry to apologise through voice chat, you would call them names. I don't know. Retard, fag, things like that. Those ones Gordon could stand. But the worst ones, mate, were the "I hope you get brain damage and die".


It hurt him. And I knew it because I was there, supporting his carry Luna with very good farm at 15:00. Mates, he lost his shit and said "Why do I take this fucking game seriously? Why? This is why I get this mood swings bullshit. Why can't I be like SingSing?"


Now before you say anything about SingSing, Gordon didn't mean to demean him or put him in a bad light. He was his big fan, for fucking God's sake. He wanted to simply be optimistic, and to take Dota like a game. And he couldn't. And his rational thoughts instead of pointing out that he suffered mood swings because the doctors did something to his brain after the first aneurysm, it told him to think that being dedicated and taking Dota "too seriously" caused this.


And, it all started, because of a flame.


Hey, SingSing, if you are reading this. Thank you. I know this post is windy and makes no sense. But I just want you to know that my friend was a big fan of yours. He loved your style, he loved your troll attempts, he loved your competitive plays, he loved it when you yell "Babushka" or "Davai Davai" or "We fucking lost". You were a big part of him mate! After the first aneurysm you became a big part of his daily routine, and you know what the most touching part is? SingSing, he looks at  you streaming, and he says:


Damn, this guy is so positive. He doesn't have mood swings. His mood is stable. He's always positive. I wish I could be like him.


And he smiles to himself, until the next tantrum takes over and he starts weeping. I've seen it. And damn it fucking hurts me to my bone.


I want to say Thank You to you, SingSing, if in the slightest chance you are reading this. I want to say thank you for accompanying Gordon to his very, very last day. I want to thank you for being an exceptional streamer and for putting positivity into a soul that was torn in half. Thank you.


Guys, please, please, please, please, please, if you could, be positive in your games. You don't know who is behind that feeding Crystal Maiden, or who is behind that instalock LC jungle. We ALL are human behind those pixels. Whether it is rushing a Blink or feeding mid, it's a human being behind it. With the extra protection of anonymity and a will to win, it is so easy to lash out at everyone. But think about it, maybe your innocuous daily banter could trigger someone's worst nightmares and cause so many disastrous consequences.


Now, I know there will be people who will not be believing this because, common, it's Reddit. I'm not asking you to. I can't prove it. I'm just another guy who lost a good friend. I'm an emotional mess and I kind of want to rant about it. Even if you don't believe it, send a prayer to Gordon and the next time you're ready to flame someone, think about how things would turn out if you said: "Hey, Crystal Maiden, I think it would be better if next time you bought a Glimmer Cape instead of a Yasha". 


Gordon, Gordon, Gordon. You're a damn fine bloke. I'm gonna miss you. You're a positive guy, my friend. And you learnt it from Sing, and he is probably very happy that he taught a guy to be positive.

As a newcomer in Dota, Turbo has been a complete gamechanger|self.DotA2|~* It's fast as hell, meaning i can try out new heroes and do new stuff, without a big risk. If i fuck up, i'm not gonna be stuck for an hour getting pounded in spawn. Warlock looks cool? Pick him and see what happens! I tried out *Templar-Fucking-Assassin* and actually got kills. I would never have done this in a regular game. 

* I get all the important items, such as Blink, Scepter and so on every game which means i can actually learn them. Everyone get's level 25 almost every game which means you can actually parttake fully. My 4k Dota-friends kept raging at me for not properly using Blink Dagger, after getting it every game in Turbo i finally got the hang of it. 

* Everyone farms so much faster meaning a mistake (which you make tons of in the beginning) doesn't fuck you up near as much. This is so liberating. 

* Since it's unranked and the games are so short, people are a lot less angry. In fact, i have barely seen any toxicity yet. No more sinking feeling in the chest after dying to a tower early-game and  telling me to uninstall. 

* I understand the gold, shops and the courir are integral parts of the mechanics in Dota. As a new player though, it's not the most fun stuff to fiddle around with. Turbo let's me focus on and learning the fun-stuff. Killing opponents, team-fighting, growing stronger and getting items. It's super-rewarding as a newcomer. 

* The fast-pace and the short games let's me play 4-5 games a day, everytime a new hero, which makes me well on my way to actually learn something. I'm easily gonna have played +100 games before the end of the month which might actually get me somewhere. 

* Because of the short games, the fun and the general non-threatening nature of Turbo, i've gotten several of my friends to try Dota. Now we are 4-5 people playing daily and on our way to becoming Dota-players. All of them new, but experienced CS GO-players. This would never have happened without Turbo. Everyones previous experience of Dota was just being eight levels behind and getting molested in spawn by a Phantom Assasin-smurf until someone disconnected. Now we are grinding, and have basically just copied our teamwork and mentality from CS GO into a new game. 

* I might be what you consider a filthy casual, but Turbo has been a complete gamechanger for me and i think it could be a huuuge addition to Dota as a game. It's the deep game of Dota with the best parts (don't kill me) of Leagues, which is the accessibility and the fun. Will definitely keep playing and see what happens.

Accidentally Scammed Someone @ Boston Major|self.DotA2|~So the short of it is exactly in the title. Due to circumstances I had to leave the Boston Major sooner than expected. I met a spectator last night at a sushi bar across from the venue who was looking to buy a finals ticket. Perfect. Except after I drove home and emptying my pockets I find out that I gave him my Friday ticket and not my Saturday. 

No idea if he browses reddit or not but I did give him my channel info so maybe he'll come yell at me there.

Fully unintended to "scam" ya buddy and if I can verify it's you I'd be more than willing to Paypal you the money back.~|personal esports
Anyone else having trouble targetting things?|self.DotA2|Since Reborn came out, I've been having trouble clicking things such as trying to harass the enemy in lane but ultimately moving to that position rather than attacking him/her. It's even worse when they're next to creeps as I would whiff spells on them which almost never happened when I played in source 1. I never had this problem before until source 2.|personal
Thank you, Dota 2. I owe you one.|self.DotA2|~edit: holy shit front page. thank you, reddit. i'm so happy about all this.

edit 2: holy lord Gold? thank you, fellow redditor. thank you for your kindness.

edit 3: so I went to sleep and... what the fuck, reddit. this is incredible... Also, since this got kind of overly viral, I just kind of want to reiterate that this isn't a fantasy or a creative writing. I know it isn't the easiest thing to believe in because of the language and the way I poke fun of myself despite going through all this. Why did I even want to write this edit? Because I want people to realise that

- Bullying can be Hollywood-movies brutal, and there are way too many male bully victims who cannot speak out due to various reasons.
- What some Western countries call "extreme homophobia" is childplay in other countries. Vietnam is one of those "other countries".
- Yes, bullying and depression leaves scars that usually affect people FOR LIFE. Yet, that doesn't mean they get wimpy and completely emotional whenever it is mentioned. **What doesn't kill me makes me more dank**. Doesn't mean I'm shitposting, simply means **I got my shit together**. Also, poking fun of myself is another one of my way saying **You fucked up my past, but all your efforts simply (literally) gave me a laugh**
- I'm not a good feeling describer, so I simply wrote what I felt. Also, the grotesque details in this thing, no matter how grotesque was *what ran through the mind of a bullied 15yrold*.  I didn't feel like repressing it. What's the point? *cumstains* and *anus* and all the other graphic stuffs aren't there for positive effect. They are there to **truly describe what I felt**. I could have used euphemism to make it seem more real, yes. However, doing so would also mean I failed to face how I really really felt about the situation. *cumstain* as a word can be a turn-on for other people. However, in this context, it is a sign of shame.

I want to thank everyone for the support, and everyone who didn't support it. You spent the time to read my story and it affected you in some way, be it positive, negative or lolzshitpost. I appreciate it. I have always been a lurker on this site but hey, **Dota 2 sub you can be as dank as you are sympathetic and awesome**

Pardon me for my English, as I'm not a native speaker. I'm using a throwaway for anonymity.
Also, this post might contain information can trigger negative responses. I respect your beliefs and if you feel like you are going to be offended, please move onto the next shitpost about ~~~~jungle LC~~~~ Usernames that are longer than Bull Dong's Dong.

Here goes the story

For all my life, I have not had the easiest childhood. I was always a scrawny Asian kid who could not fit in. I was weak and clumsy and awkward. My so-called "friends" would not talk to me, ever, and they told the whole school to stay away from me. It was horrible, but I was fine. At least I was left... alone. Yet loneliness did not even last long when I came home black and blue, covered in bruises, day by day. I would go to school, take a beating, getting catcalled, and went home. "F*ggot, queer, c*cksucker, p*ssyboy", you name it. I had it all. For a country as homophobic as Vietnam, there was barely anything I could do. Everyday of school felt like literal living hell. The catcalls were not so bad. Neither were the punches nor the kicks. Nothing was nearly as bad as being pinned against the walls of a closed bathroom cubicle, with a cloth in my mouth and three hungry highschoolers queuing up behind me, taking turns to "fuck the gay out of me". When the party is done and they were satisfied, they would let me go, never forgetting to leave a death threat if I spreaded it out. I staggered home, my face washed of the cumstains that would forever haunt me. My soul, however, was dirtied - squished, stomped on, turned into a cheap gloryhole for the enjoyment of people. I was stuck. My parents would have killed me if I told them a thing. My school was against anything not heterosexual. My world, day by day, collapsed. I had it all.


Whenever I was home, after I was done with bawling my eyes out, cutting myself, skipping meals and every other self-harm courses of action a 15yearold could manage, I would turn to Dota, as a last resort. I've known it since the Defense of the Ancients day, and it never left me. I was never a good player, but I didn't care. Dota was the drug and I was the addict, as focusing on landing a perfect Mass Serpent Ward would take me away from the still-open scars in my anus that would open up tomorrow, and the day after that, because my "pussy" needed to be "satisfied" by those 3 people. So, I played. And I played a lot. During the course of a normal game, I met a teammate called Glen. I still remembered that match I was Shadow Shaman and he was Wisp. We were losing badly, and the other 3 teammates started to become toxic. I always tried to be a positive dude in my games, and so was Glen. We were spamming mic to cheer our teammates up. He was cracking jokes about my terrible attempts at Snakeblocking the enemies despite having had a Euls. From something like 3 - 25, we managed to get a crazy number of pickoffs and were able to get our items. Long story short, we won, and I added Glen on Steam. We almost always played daily from 6 pm to 10 pm and would chat on Steam about how we could improve ourselves. As time went by, we became more comfortable with each other and we started to open up. We started to talk less about aiming ET's combo and more about ourselves. I felt, for the first time in my life, as if I was not alone.


Glen was my friend. Albeit my online, unreal friend whose real name I probably did not even know, but he was a friend. Glen was the first person to whom I told about the beatings and the catcalls, probably because I felt safe behind this "internet anonymity". My walls started to slowly break down, not because I trusted him, but because I was desparately looking for something, if anything, to put my trust into. I bawled my eyes out while typing angrily at Steam chat. He would say it's okay and try to cheer me up, usually by carrying me through the trench using ridiculous hero builds. Armlet CM, Orchid Leshrac, you name it. Playing Dota with Glen was something I looked forward to when my days were dark. He would always attempt to make the corniest jokes on mic in order to make me laugh. After every game and every post-game Steam rant, I opened up a bit more, until I was naked. I told Glen everything about me, and so did he. I knew where he lived, and it turned out we lived very close to each other, 5 minutes walking distance.


Ever since that day, we hung out together. Everything was the same. My days were shitty. I felt like shit. I wanted to kill myself. I was stuck. However, Glen was there with me, and so was Dota. Glen was there with me, playing Wisp and Relocating a RO + Agha Shadow Shaman into the enemy's base for an unexpected rat. Glen was there with me, talking to me about our games and about ourselves, when just 4 months ago we were Steam strangers foolishly divulging our deep dark secrets. Everything was the same, but it was different, because Glen was there. An abused kid, and an orphan, playing Dota together to forget this bitter world.


As I'm writing this, my brain is writhing and aching with wounds from the past that for me, would never be closed. The ghost-white walls of the cubicle, my pale face with what felt like buckets of cum and hatred on it. Yes, I still feel terrible, and I probably will always do. But as I'm writing this, there is a tall and handsome guy ready to take me to dinner.


I won't be alone. He would be there, with me, at my table. He would hold my hands like the first time he did, when we were hi-fiving after a Rampage, but none of us wanted to let go. We would talk about Dota like we always did, two little kids peeling their souls on Steam chat. I can't be more thankful that I found him in my life - no, I can't be more thankful that I found Dota in my life.


It was because of Dota that I was able to last through the many days that felt almost unbearable. "All Pick!" was what kept me going. It gave me just the boost of hope that I needed to not do dumb things to myself, and I survived - barely, but I survived, til the day I met my Wisp picker and added him as my first Steam friend.

I am grateful for every moment that I'm spending with Glen, and all of the memories we have had playing Dota together. Those last hits contest in which the loser becomes the bottom, and I would always pick something as horrendous as a CM so as to deliberately let him win. Those moments when neither of us casted a spell on a dying enemy because "I'M THE SUPPORT. NO I AM. FUCK OFF YOU'RE A 4. YOU TAKE THE KILL" and the 10hp CM got away, Allchatting "Wat". Those moments when he was tryharding so that his MMR would be higher than mine, and I would snuck under his desk working my magic while he played his position 4 Wisp feeling constantly Overcharged. Sometimes, he even died out. And the Shadow Shaman cake. And those super cool Shadow Shaman Golden item for our anniversary (I told him I'd get him his long-awaited Wisp Arcana). You know what, all of this is so fucking awesome and I'm feeling so fucking lucky because I literally went to hell and back (but not back to hell and back).

**All, because, I kept on playing Dota 2**.


I know it sounds cheesy, but things **do get better**. It probably will not turn out great, but it definitely does get better. For those of you who are, for whatever reasons, using Dota as a safe place, know that it things do change, and if Dota is the only thing that makes you hold onto yourself, play the hell out of it. But also, when you've got the bare minimum energy to survive for another day, look for a change - anything, anybody - that could help you.


To Glen, and I hope you read this. I love Shadow Shaman so much that if you think he's off-meta, you can go fuck yourself instead of me.

TL; DR: Bullied in school, depressed, self-harmed, Dota-ed the day away, made friend, talked to friend, turned out friend lived nextdoor, hung out with friend, things got better, still playing Dota, feeling thankful as hell.~|personal
Arc Warden was buffed, but it was too late|self.DotA2|~I had a friend.

He was the best CK I have ever seen.

He used to play Arc Warden even after every nerf and still managed to win with it.

He used to do silly combos with me and my other friends.

As I said, he was the best CK player I have ever seen.

He rode into the fights with calm.

He used to say he had a bunch of illusions fighting and one resting.

He was nice to his horse.

Lets go Armageddon he used to say on discord call.

A beast of farming.

A player who know when and how to end the games.

We played together 400 games in a short span of time.

He started playing two years ago.

But we were friends for nine years.

We played a lot of other games; we had a lot of fun.

I made videos with him and my other friend, theyre still on YouTube.

We were the inseparable trio.

Were.

Was.

Used to be.

One day, not long ago, my other friend sent me a message.

He, the best CK player I have ever seen, was not with us anymore.

A note, saying that it was fun and that he was sorry.

A note, saying goodbye and with hope of seeing us again in the afterlife.

A final note.

I still remember the day he said that they would buff Arc Warden the day he died.

He died, and later that day 7.12 came out. 

One final joke.

Last online: 10 days ago.

And the trio became a duo, forever.

If Liquid wins TI7 I'll tattoo MinD_ContRoL face on my ass|self.DotA2|~MinD_ContRoL is someone I've followed and respected long before he became a pro player. Back when I was higher mmr than him and before NEL days (for him). He played his old classic Clockwerk in the offlane 1v3 lanes. DESTROYING HIS 1vs3 LANES. Killing my carries and supports under the tower while I little shit was jacking in the offlane. 1 VS 3. 1 VS 3 HE DID THIS.

I've been trying to find the game, but I can't. I do have this though
https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1313758781 (chat, Oracle me)

I always get very emotional when I see him have success. Seeing him and @Liquid get to the final gives me a feeling I can't describe. It's weird cause it feels like I am there winning myself, but it's them. I just love them. 

I think it'll be worth tattooing (that a word? xdxdxDX) cause whenever I see his face I get happy. I like my fine ass too so don't worry, a mirror will do whenever I feel lonely.

Now fuck off and release yalls energy!



() () TAKE MY ENERGY TEAM LIQUID ()()

--------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: HOLY MAKAFUCKINGRONI LIQUID! I'm shaking so damn happy for the boys :O;zczxkckaSKDkas

It'd be awesome if some of you talented guys could make some sort of art I could use for the tattoo. I'm imagining something like a portrait of his face to under tits with stacks of money on the side of him. You guys go ham cause I have no idea how it should look :D

I'll update on https://twitter.com/ddsama910 when I go take it. I'll post it here aswell so hope yall like some booty. (If mods let it up)

Will do it as soon as possible. GG Newbee and grats to all Liquid supporters! This TI have felt so amazing. Not sure how much that's amplified by Liquid winning, but great, yes. 

Gratz too all of Dota 2 community for making this event possible! 
I love you reddit hope you all great and gl in your lives! Hope you all good.

aight i should shut hte fuck up cuz imma go of on some random shit stopping myself GRATS EVERYONE

---------------------------------------------

Edit3: I'll be going to bed, barely slept during all TI. If you have questions unrelated to the tattoo fire away and I'll answer them once I wake up. Not played Dota since december last year. I'm excited for the new season. Happy new year everyone!

---------------------------------------------

Edit4: I will follow through with this, but it's gonna take some time. The closest tattoo shop to me is 200km away. I'm not doing this just for reddit so to yall whos so concerned about this all being a mistake. If I ever get in an argument I can just shoot out the "I have a Tea Eye winner on my ass". If it becomes a problem later in life I can just taze it up and literally shit his face out. Also I've thought about how many memories I will forget once dota is gone. Maybe this tattoo will keep me in check. 

I'm trying to figure out how much it will cost n get my dad on a roadtrip not knowing whats up. This threads done. Patience from Zhou.~|personal

-------------------------------------------


Hello /r/dota2.

Today is my last day of Dota 2. For now. Probably for at least two months. Our energy supply is being cut off and I won't be able to play. Or use the computer at all. Or eat a warm meal. Or take a hot shower. Or use the heating during the cold fall.

I don't know why exactly I'm making this post. I guess I just wanna talk about it. As long as I still can.

Many months ago, I lost my job, which paid decently. I fell back into bad habits. I have been suffering from depression for at least the past 9 years, probably way longer. And since I lost that job, it's only gotten so much worse. Suicidal thoughts dictate my every day. Ever since, I've been living on benefits while working a little in a small restaurant to help pay the bills. Which, any person suffering from depression will attest you, is very straining.

I still live at home with my sick elderly mother, two of my sisters, and my six year old niece. I come from a poor family. None of my ten siblings have any noteworthy education. They only speak their mother tongue and struggle with elementary school maths. Some of them work, some, like my two sisters here at home, don't. We asked around for family and friends who could lend us some money, just so we could take a breather, catch up on our energy bill and get our shit in order. No one helped, but one friend of mine. But it's not enough. By tonight, I will not have energy at my house. I will only be able to charge my phone during my drive to work two to three times a week.

The best thing about all this: I'm being blamed for it. Apparently, according to my family, it's all my computer using the energy. Totally not the three very old fridges, or the washing machine and dryer running at least twice a day, or their three TVs running literally 24/7. Or the lights in the corridors being on every night because they're afraid of stumbling on their way to the toilet. Or their constant heating instead of maybe wearing some warmer clothes. Nope. It's all because of my computer, which, after five minutes inactivity, turns itself off. My computer, which only runs when I actually play Dota or watch some show. Which is maybe 20 hours a week, at most. The rest of the day, I'm either at work, or in bed, sleeping, crying and trying to convince me not to kill myself. And certainly it's my fault for losing my job back then and my fault for suffering from a mental illness, that we don't have much money. Can't possibly be the fact that my siblings refuse to work, because they wouldn't have the time to care for their SEVEN dogs.

I'm sorry for ranting here. I'm just seriously pissed and sad because of this whole situation. I would LOVE to just move the fuck out, but I'm literally the only one taking care of my mother. Everytime I talk about moving away, she's emotionally abusing me, talking down on me, telling me how I'm nothing and will never amount to anything either and couldn't even afford living on my own. The thing is, I'm literally the _only one_ in our family who could probably amount to something. I'm the only one who went to the Gymnasium, which is the highest form of school education here in Germany. The only one who could, in theory, visit the university, get a degree and a job that pays well. I'm just so fucked in the head, because of my depression and anxiety issues. I have been raised into this state of mental illness, and now I'm stuck with it. Doctors only offer appointments every six months or so, and after every visit, I'm on my own for another couple of months. This is all so fucked up.

Anyway, I didn't mean to drag you guys down with me. I just wanted to say, thanks for reading. And more importantly, thanks for giving me something _to read_ and entertaining me everyday. I'm just sad I won't see the Journey Update, and won't be able to play Sun Wukong the Monkey King for at least two months, until we catch up on our bills... I've been waiting for this since forever. I literally cried during the hero reveal at TI6. I got some professional coaching sessions back when I still had the money for it, and I was planning on really starting through on my journey to 6k and beyond. Then I lost the job. And all motivation to play, and live.

I hope to see you guys again when all of this is over. Thanks for being you, /r/dota2. Thanks for all the shitposts, art, interesting suggestions, for the patch analysis /u/SirBelvedere, funny videos, cool gifs and even the complaints and frustrated rage posts.

Again, sorry for this confused mess of a post.

I'll probably hang around for a while after this post, if you wanna comment. 


--------------------------------


**Edit**: Wow. I did not expect this to blow up the way it did. Thank you all for your very kind comments and private messages. It means the world. As you can see, I still have electricity, for the moment. They might still show up today, but maybe I'm lucky and they have their hands full and won't make it before tomorrow? Who knows!

Either way, I'll try to get back to most of you guys. Again, thank you!

And regarding something like a GoFundMe or Patreon, like many of you suggested: I'm not sure I feel comfortable accepting money from you guys. On the other hand, it would be kind of irresponsible to not at least try. I'll have to think about it. ... And read up on how all of that would actually work.

**Edit 2**: We went to the courthouse the other day and the judge ruled in our favor with an interim injunction, meaning the energy company can't cut us off _right now_. This is only temporary though. (I'm sorry for possibly using the wrong terminology here - I'm not too well-versed in law.) http://i.imgur.com/nUh3aka.jpg (Proof) So we're gonna be online over the weekend at least!

**Edit 3**: 101 in 9 hours. Wow. I don't know what to say. You guys have already lifted such a huge burden off my shoulders. I can't thank you enough. I promise, I **will** try my best to return the favor. Just not sure yet how.~|personal

After three weeks in the ICU, a Cancer patient is asking for one favor.|self.DotA2|~EDIT:UPDATE: Oh mai gawddd. Thank you so much /r/dota2 and Reddit for such a great response to my situation! Me and my family have been overwhelmed by the amount of people wishing me good luck, and who want to help me out!

I've been contacted by a Valve employee, a professional caster, and a bunch of fellow Dota 2 fans and Seattleites who are offering me badges! So I am well covered in that department.

If you want to follow my journey through fighting Cancer you can follow me @Fduerme on twitter. 

I plan on streaming later tonight (around 5pm PST) to answer some questions at [twitch.tv/ken_domo](http://www.twitch.tv/ken_domo)

Original Post
>Hello /r/Dota 2. I'm a 23 year old hardcore Dota 2 player who has never missed an International since it's been in Seattle. A year ago I was diagnosed with Lymphoma in one of the roughest ways. I had to be rushed to the ICU a month after attending Ti4 via helicopter, where I was put into a coma for about a three weeks.

>You can see a photo album of my journey so far [here](http://imgur.com/a/h5kuv). (Including a picture of me and purge)

>You can see a small part of my Ti collection [here](http://imgur.com/h1RThFA).
Now, I'm pretty much at the international. I am currently living in South Lake Union which is 15 blocks away from Key Arena. I unfortunately cannot go this year because of the two transplants I have to undergo literally today. I'm pretty much not going to have an immune system at the time of Ti5, so big crowds is a no-no.

>I love Dota 2, and have spent over a thousand dollars at the secret shop. Not pictured are the T-shirts, plushes, pins, and accessories. Outside of Ti i have probably spent another thousand dollars on just in-game gear and compendiums. I also was an open coach who taught lessons for donations and even worked on an in-game announcer with Earl Alexander who was the voice of Louis from Left 4 Dead. The announcer was unfortunately rejected, but that's another story.

>/r/dota2, Valve, Gabe, anyone. I need one thing from Ti5. A badge. I've worn every Ti badge to every single international, and I'm going to be missing this years badge. I want to go to Ti6 and want to be able to still keep on this sort-of pointless tradition that I've been keeping up.

>If you can help a guy out please comment or PM me.

If you still want to donate to my fight, go to my [gofundme](http://www.gofundme.com/francoduerme). Or just shoot me a PM.~|personal
Open Letter to Dendi from a fanboy|self.DotA2|With all due respect i would like to state that after enduring much repression i decided to express my thoughts on your high-esteem career. I have been a fan of NaVi since TI1 and a proud one at that. I hold pride in stating that i witnessed your ridiculous RUBICK ravages and legendary FOUNTAIN HOOKS live. I have to say, it broke my heart when Mr.S4 cancelled your tp. I almost went into depression after watching your street interview right after TI3 finals. These are only a few of the many reasons why it saddens me when NAVI losses a match even today. As a sincere NaVi fan I will forever owe NaVi for all those magical moments and will always believe in the team. However, amidst the criticism and mockery I come out to tell you that you have been deprived of the platform that a player of your caliber truly deserve. On behalf of all the fans of NaVi i would like to thank you for your loyalty and devotion to the team but despite our utmost respects, i believe it is everyone's view that you have served your time well enough to say goodbye to NaVi and look forward to greater endeavors. It is painful to see a talent like you fade away especially when it could very well be just because of lack of exposure. Having said all that i have, i believe you know best for yourself and will support you through thick and thin. Sincerely, tier 1 fan. P.S. i tried my best to sound professional..forgive my english.|personal esports
Enough Memes. I beat unfair bots 1v5 with every single hero (with match IDs)|self.DotA2|~EDIT: none of the match ID's work, I think because I hosted on my computer instead of on valve servers.  Believe what you want : )



It took several months, but I did it... I defeated the game 1v5 against unfair bots as every hero. 

It started when I found myself in the situation of having copious unscheduled down time at work.  I was allowed to do whatever I wanted, as long as I could drop it within 60 seconds to go on a call.  This, combined with terrible work wifi, made an actual game of DotA impossible.  I found myself playing bot games, practicing heroes like invoker and earth spirit.  Eventually someone suggested to me that I try playing 1v5, as it was more of a challenge.  With all of the bots on unfair, of course.

I initially thought that the best way to succeed would be to split push with radiance illusions, so I chose Alchemist and went to work.  Success left me wondering... is this really the only viable strategy?  Or can other heroes succeed as well?

My next idea was to wait for all 5 of the enemy bots to push together, and then destroy them all with one move... This led to playing a largely reactive game as Enigma, waiting for the perfect moment to attack with Aghanim's Black Hole, midnight pulse, and radiance.  I wound up still using the radiance/manta combo to push out lanes.

Again having success with radiance/manta, I thought of other natural Radiance heroes.  I chose Doom, and then Abaddon, and then Axe, each time relying on Radiance to win.

The next game I chose sniper and simply rushed Rapier.  With two rapiers and two moonshards, the bots couldn't even approach me as I destroyed their base.  

At this point, the games begin to blur together... some of the high points:

* Earthshaker one shotting bots with enchant totem attacks.  Game ended 62-0

* Realizing bots have no concept of how to play against Techies.  They never bought sentries.

* 1900 gpm as Bounty Hunter, this was the only game where I did not lane mid.  This would be the highest GPM of any 1v5 game I played.  Track is the ideal farm accelerator when you get 59 kills in under 30 minutes.

* 64 kills in 26 minutes as Pudge.  This was one of the most fun games I played by far.

* Having 80+ Bloodstone charges on Lion with Aghanims and Octarine.  Being able to cast AoE finger of death every 14 seconds was very satisfying.  Other fun bloodstone games included Skywrath Mage and Ogre Magi.

* 3x rapier Ember Spirit.  3x rapier Nyx Assassin.  3x rapier Crystal Maiden.

* 17:50 win as Huskar.  This was my fastest win, I ended 34-1 with 1415 GPM

* 4x Butterfly Mirana.  3x Heart Centaur.  4x Daedalus Kunkka

One Hundred and Eleven games later, I can say that I have beaten DotA 1v5 against unfair bots as every single hero (except Pit Lord).  The hardest heroes were Wisp, Ancient Apparition, and Bane

A big lesson was that any hero can split push with radiance/manta/BoT.  

Another lesson was that any hero can carry with enough rapiers and moonshards.

After playing so many Bot games, I have some comments about the bots themselves:

As far as general bot behavior, it's incredibly predictable and abusable.

* whichever bot is mid will go for the top rune ten seconds before it spawns... regardless of its health, or your positioning, or your ability to kill it.  In most matchups I would aim to kill the bot when it went for the 2 minute and 4 minute rune, and after that I was snowballing so hard I would kill it easily.

* Bots have NO idea how to deal with aura damage (radiance, ion shell).  If they are caught out in the open with this, they will run away from the damage source, rather than run towards safety.  It's easy to simply chase bots until they die to the radiance burn.

* AI breaks down when you break into their base.  Maybe they have a waypointing system that doesn't know what to do if an enemy is in their base?  In any case, they will often rally to in between their T4 and T3 and just stand there while you kill their base.

* Don't care about protecting their throne.  Will literally run to lanes to farm while it is taking damage.  Same for barracks, though they do tend to protect towers.

* Can easily be put into retreat! mode.  If they are taking enough damage, they will run away rather than use abilities that would keep them alive.  The only exception to this seems to be shadowblade, they love running away with shadowblade.

Some comments about the specific hero behavior:

* Axe: Generally useless.  Mostly spams battle hunger.  Every once in a while will farm a blink dagger successfully, but it is rare.

* Bane: the single scariest support bot.  Unfair bots have no issue 5 man ganking you with fiend's grip.  Tends to farm necronomicon.

* Bounty Hunter: sometimes will just forget to escape with invis.  Generally useless.

* Bloodseeker: absolutely terrible at laning, using bloodrage on himself at all times.  Rupture is still one of the better bot ultimates, and will kill you if you don't expect it when the bots 5 man.

* Bristleback: his scariest tendency is to spam goo while tower diving you.  In a couple games he got truly out of hand with vanguard/blademail/heart.  One of the better bots.

* Chaos Knight: by far the scariest carry bot.  4 second stun, enough said.  Also he builds armlet/heart and will destroy your base if he isn't kept under control.  The most important bot to gank mercilessly.

* Crystal Maiden: almost completely useless.  Occasionally she will disable you or use her ultimate, but generally she dies too quickly and is just food.

* Dazzle: casts shallow grave effectively.  That's about it.

* Death Prophet: very bad at using spirit siphon.  But she will use exorcism to destroy your base if you let her.  She will also use exorcism immediately before dying.  Really bad AI on this bot.

* Dragon Knight: he will stun you and occasionally turn into a dragon.  But he never gets the items or the farm to make his hero actually matter.

* Drow Ranger: she will spam frost arrows on you in team fights, and seems to use her silence more than death prophet does.  Always builds into shadowblade, which is annoying.  Probably the best ranged carry bot.  Nowhere near as scary as Chaos Knight though.

* Earthshaker: he's good for a fissure and that's it.  Will sometimes echo slam, but usually not.

* Jakiro: moderately scary just because he will use liquid fire on towers and push them faster than other bots.  He also buys a mek almost every game, and consistently lands icepaths if you don't try to dodge them.  One of the better support bots, but he's not going to kill you like Bane bot is.

* Juggernaut: He can be scary when he remembers to use omnislash, but I still don't understand when he will/won't omnislash, it seems random.  Never farms enough to matter outside of his ultimate and healing ward.

* Kunkka: He's bad at landing torrents, but he's great at landing X.  X will get you killed more than any other non-ultimate bot ability.  With that said, he never farms any meaningful items.  Just beware of X.

* Lich: useless

* Lina: VERY bad at landing her stun.  And she will use laguna blade.  Pretty easy to just kill her though, and she never farms defensive items.  

* Lion: when he remembers to stun you, he's scary.  Most of the time his AI gets stuck on retreat! and he forgets to cast his abilities.  Never farms a blink dagger, either.

* Luna: unlike Juggernaut, she reliably casts her ultimate and will kill you.  Unlike human Luna players, she never farms up big items.  

* Necrophos: another bot that is basically a walking ultimate.  

* Omniknight: useless.  Never uses his abilities properly

* Oracle: worse than useless, he tends to heal you more than damage you, and never uses his abilities in the correct order.  False promise always just delays death by 5 seconds, as he never heals the target during the duration.  

* Phantom Assassin: mostly useless, but even without items PA can get some big crits and surprise you.  Best not to let her get to level 16.

* Pudge: he's decent at landing a hook and then dismembering you... if you're standing still.  He's terrible at predicting hooks like a human player would, and is easily baited into missing his hook.  The most annoying thing about this hero is his ability to suicide and deny you kills.

* Razor: useless.  Is not aggressive in lane, uses his ultimate randomly, barely tries to maintain static links.

* Sandking: consistently stuns you.  I don't think he ever used epicenter properly though.

* Shadowfiend: I have never seen anyone miss so many shadowrazes.  He will fire them randomly and in the complete wrong direction, often turning away from creeps to cast one.  I am literally shocked whenever a raze hit me.  Never buys shadowblade/blink/euls or any other item that would actually matter.  Never uses ultimate aggressively.  Definitely the easiest bot to lane against and the easiest to kill in the first 2 minutes of the game.

* Skywrath Mage: generally just a feeder.  Never buys any survivability.  Mystic Flare is a lot of damage if he manages to cast it while you are stunned, otherwise he always misses it.

* Sniper: like drow, he always buys shadowblade.  But he is much worse than drow, incredibly easy to kill and to just keep too poor to matter.

* Sven: scary when he casts god's strength and then clicks on your base.  Mostly harmless otherwise.

* Tidehunter: rarely uses Ravage... I think his AI makes hiim want to save it for more than one enemy, which erally hurts him in a 1v5 scenario.  Pretty much a fat melee creep.

* Tiny: does not know how to combo.  Doesn't buy blink or Aghs.  Just a walking stun for the most part.

* Vengeful Spirit: she WILL swap you into her team.  One of the scarier ultimates if the bots group up and push.

* Viper: moderately annoying to lane against, but I think Valve toned down his aggressive last hitting because it honestly was never that bad.  Doesn't aggressively slow you like bristleback will, which is weird considering he has 3 slows.

* Warlock: heals teammates throughout the game.  That's all he does.

* Windranger: easy to bait out windrun, rarely uses focus fire on heroes, occasionally lands shackles.

* Witchdoc: one of the only bots that casts his combo consistently, will try to cask/maledict/deathward every time he sees you.  But never farms shadowblade/bkb so it's always easy to kill him.

* Wraithking: A stun that can't miss, and a tendency to build armlet.  If only he knew how to farm up real items.

* Zeus: doesn't cs with chain lightning, doesn't spam his lightning bolt.  I have no idea what he's saving his mana for.

If anyone has any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them.  This was a six month long project for me, and I'm proud of the results.  Here are the match ID's of every single 1v5 win:

The Drama Continues|twitlonger.com||personal esports
Dota 2 comes through|self.DotA2|~Ive had a rough past couple of years. Parents died to drug addiction, Fiance left me to chase better things, joined the army to have a decent life, but the one thing that has always provided me an escape was Dota 2. I see too many posts on here about how Dota is ruining lives, well today it saved one. Not one single family member called me to wish me happy birth day or hell even post on Facebook, but Ill always have Dota 2 mates that pull through. 

Thanks for being such an awesome Dota 2 community. The content on here is what keeps me going 

Edit: Im humbled by your response. Just to show how awesome r/dota2 is. Thanks for making my day, Im gonna remember this one.~|personal
As a thirld world gamer, I've a very small feature request to valve|self.DotA2|~Pleeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaase bring back net_graph. My internet connect is unreliable and I'm very reliant on knowing if I can play with my connection or not. Before reborn was released, I had a simple method. I would spectate a live game and if the ping fluctuation was below 30ms (represented by ping  fluctuation), that means I can play properly. 

The one option we have currently is way less detailed. It does not update properly, gets blocked by the UI in some custom games (like overthrow). It also does not show the upload/download rate of the game.

I know most of you do not care about this and have no interest whatsoever. Maybe I'm the only guy who wants this. But please, this means a lot to me. Very rarely my ping would spike for a few seconds during a game and I would immediately know that I've to take that into consideration in my decision making at that moment. (Btw, this has not actually affected my skills a lot and I've adjusted to it. I'm 3.4k, if it matters.)

Unfortunately this is not a shitpost. This is my humble request to everyone to not downvote this if you don't agree with me or are not interested in this (all my other posts have been).

I've been trying to contact Valve through the dev forums and other means but I've received no reply as of yet. Maybe this will get buried as well, but I'm trying.~|personal

We don't care if there is an Pharaoh PL, cowboy hat Ursa or cat eared Drow Ranger.  Shit, if there was a playboy bunny eared Pudge, we would probably shell out cash for it.  If we don't like a set or announcer, we won't spend money on it, but it doesn't offend us if other people do.

Drakyl's casting is fine.

We don't spam all chat saying "report please" for someone on our team having a shitty game.

Enjoy TI7 people, just do it in moderation. Too much energy drink and you'll turn into GrandGrant, too much NA dota and you turn into PPD, too much EU dota and you turn into  , too much SEA dota and suddenly you want to put tanks in malls.

Pretty nice dude we became friends and now play dota 2 together.

I can't stand the treasure 3 complaints anymore|self.DotA2|~Please give it a rest.  You aren't going to start a boycott, reddit complained about the drop rates from last years immortals also, this isn't new.

To all the people comparing their drops this year to previous years... 30-50 spins is not even close to a sufficient sample size!  The fact you didn't get what you wanted doesn't mean escalating odds are broken, the odds don't magically turn into 100% after your 30 spins.  Also there's no rule that valve can't change their odds, there are F2P/P2W games out there that have far worse odds and absolutely no information for drop rates.  These are skins/outfits, they give no advantage or disadvantage in game by owning them and it seems extremely reasonable for a F2P game.


I buy the battle pass because the whole package makes the game more fun for me and makes TI more enjoyable, skins are cool but I'm certainly not buying this just for the cool sword sven has.  Does everyone else buy their battle pass strictly for these immortal treasures? Most of these posts lately sound like they're coming from 13 year olds who just lost money at a casino asking for a refund because they didn't know the odds and didn't win what they expected.~|personal
To the pros who keep saying "I'm sorry I let everyone down"|self.DotA2|~This keeps coming up again and again, and I just want to say this.

How is it you think we see you? Why do you think we follow you? Only ever to watch you win?

Are we rats that jump ship the minute it starts to sink? Switch loyalty to the winning players?

I have a smile on my face to watch your amazing plays that most of us could only ever dream of making. Sometimes I smile so much watching DOTA that my face hurts. I get so excited that I shout.

I do not care if cynical people think this is kissing ass, it's about what's true and I have never in my life lost love for my favourite pros because they lose games and tourneys.

If you sat on your ass, if you didn't try, that would let us down.

If you were too smug and thought you didn't have to prepare properly, that would let us down.

But none of you do, you strategise, you work like crazy and you play like gods out of your mind and to me personally you bring nothing but joy.

I just needed to say this because every time I see someone who makes me happy just to watch them play say "I'm sorry I let everyone down" it breaks my fucking heart.~|personal

Today, a Crystal Maiden player donated me his Tomb of Knowledge|self.DotA2|~He innocently said in his SEA native tongue "hayz!" and called attention towards himself. Poor guy had been disconnected for half of the laning stage. He walked towards me, wearing just some brown boots, carrying a bunch of sentries and a tomb of knowledge. Took him a while to catch up to my Terrorblade speeding away using the Yasha and BoTs. He innocently handed the tomb to me and just walked away.

I was left speechless. This was the first time I had been given a tomb to use. A tomb that a guy bought using about a fifth of his networth. And I didn't even acknowledge him running after me since a minute, I was too busy microing my illusions. 

I just couldn't bring myself to use it. It felt wrong. 

I went and put the item back into his inventory. He wrote a "no" followed by "use it" and again gave it to me. I said "its just a game my friend, enjoy it". I dragged it over his hero, and teleported away. 

He stood there for the next 10 seconds. That was perhaps the first time he had been respected, and treated as an equal. He knew he had fucked up, he was more or less a liability to us in the laning phase, but that tomb was a reminder of the fact that he too was a fellow Dota 2 player, that too one from SEA where disconnects are frequent. 

He never used it. It was in his inventory in the post-game screen. He kept it as some sort of a trophy which he had earned.~|personal
For 905 hours, my friend has played fully zoomed.|self.DotA2|~My friend has been playing for about a year, he tends to be our 5th or 6th man when it comes to queuing due to his mediocre dota skills. Just today our stack was playing a usual pub, and we dumped him on the support ogre role (his usual position). It was about 15 minutes into to the game and our ogre said in mumble, "you can zoom out!?!?!". We replied by saying that you can only zoom out in spectator mode. Me and everyone else was a little bit confused with the zoom out discussion. Then, one of our friends casually mentioned that you can only zoom out if you're zoomed in. Still a bit confused, my friend asked if they added zooming out in 6.84 (He never reads the patch notes). Then, realization hit him. He reluctantly brought up the idea that maybe he had been playing zoomed in for his entire dota career. Me and my entire stack were initially in disbelief about this. And as we started to look back at things, it became more and more clear that he truly had been playing fully zoomed for all of his 900 hours. Here is a list of things we realized while playing the match.

- He calibrated at 1.7k solo mmr and has stayed their ever since
- He is inept at last hitting (when zoomed in the creeps are clumped)
- He often struggles at finding people in teamfights to stun
- He has surprisingly good map awareness, he mentioned that he uses the minimap a lot as a substitute to lack of vision.
- He also has a problem where he doesn't like to buy wards. During the match he explained that he thought they were useless because he could not see out of his small area of vision.

If you haven't ever seen what being fully zoomed in is like, it's kind of like playing smite but much much worse. We were still shocked, amazed, and yet still in disbelief about this, so we asked him some questions for proof. We asked if he had ever watched any pro matches on twitch, and he said that he thought that only spectator mode looked like that. Another thing we wondered about is how he had never accidentally zoomed out. Apparently his old mouse never had a scroll wheel and he just got a new one this week. Looking back on it, he could have been a much better dota player. To us he just seemed to be on a slow learning curve. Now I wonder how many more matches we would have won if he was zoomed out. Here is his dotabuff if you were wondering -http://www.dotabuff.com/players/153051755

Edit 1 - There has been a lot of questions regarding on how he zoomed in in the first place. I just talked to him. When he first started playing he used on of those apple mouses that don't have a scroll wheel. Instead you scroll by rubbing your fingers upwards. So he believes that in one of his first games he scrolled upwards yet never changed it. He then later disabled the rub upwards scroll feature because it interfered with games like minecraft. And now he has a new mouse

Edit 2 - Thank you to /u/nihlushall13 for showing how zoomed in he played

Edit 3 - For those wondering how he has a 54% winrate, we 5 stack all the time and he plays position 5 supports. We play fairly well as a team so we tend to win a bit

Casting your games to help afford my trip to TI|self.DotA2|~With the announcement of TI this year and tickets going on sale this week I thought it was time to post this.

I am looking to help fund my trip to TI by casting your pub games (or maybe even your battles pass tournaments too!)

I have never been to TI and I am desperately looking to attend but it is usually too expensive for me and I just can never afford the trip, tickets, lodging, food etc.

So what I'm looking to do is cast your games for at least 10 dollars a game (or any amount more if you want) or battle pass tournament runs for a different price but I haven't thought of it yet because it could be one game it could be three.

- Basically you email me at Bkopcasting@gmail.com tell me which game/s you want cast.

- I'll download the game so it doesn't dissapear on me and I can cast it

- Then you PayPal me as soon as you can doesn't have to be immediately just when you do is when I'll get to casting the game

- Finally I'll cast the game back and I'll email you a private listing on YouTube to the game and if you want me to make it public I will.

If you want me to stream it on my [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/bkopcasting) I can do that do and then post it to YouTube too.

So yea in conclusion I'm trying to afford TI by casting your pubs or battle pass games. Hope all is well and hope to see you all at TI

Edit: just wanted to let you all know that I will also most likely start casting requested games after DPL and possibly after passover(having a lot of family over doing a lot of cooking and well don't want to keep people up either) but there is a lot of time until ti and I work as hard as possible to cast every single game!

Edit 2: some people have been asking if they can just donate and if that's what you want to do this is the [link](http://paypal.me/bkopcasting)

PA Arcana changed my games completely|self.DotA2|~I am a 2.5k mmr scrub, since i bought my pa arcana all my games have been different. i play on SEA servers, so you can imagine the flame wars in these servers

but now, everyone is cooperating, people are like 

"please protect pa she needs kill"

"pa dont farm there, it is not safe"

"wards are on cooldown, please wait till i buy them"

"i'll stack ancients for you pa"

"dont go battlefury this game they have mobile heroes buy bkb and basher"

people are picking a minimum of 2 supports to protect me, sometimes even 3

they are fighting over who gets to buy wards,smoke and dust

even when i die stupidly they are not blaming me, instead they give me advice on how and where to farm safely

if i finish my contract this behaviour only increases.

if i fail my contract they will co-operate more so that the enemy team doesnt get the item sets

they commend me for having an arcana and letting them win item sets

dota is finally flame free?

TL:DR: PA Arcana is literally paytoberespected.

Battle Cup Revenge|self.DotA2|~So last night was my first crack at Battle Cup.

I started to frantically look for a team with an hour and a half until registration began. 

I got invited into a party which was now full with the inclusion of me, they ask what role I preferred and I said I play best in the position 1 or 2.

They all laughed at me and started being complete ass holes stating to kick me and that nobody with my MMR (which is 2.6k) will be carrying their team. 

Mind you this is fucking tier 3.... so not the greatest skill level. They had high opinions of themselves shoving their high 3000s MMR in my face and putting me down. Then continued to complain and sook also stating "if you don't kick him im leaving" 

I just decided to leave and make my own team... 

I'll try make this short, I ended up constructing a team where everyone was suited to their roles and MMR was never even asked about. I captained this team into the grand final, where we faced the ass holes that be littled me. I shared this story to my team as motivation and we slaughtered them, claiming my first ever battle Cup and a bunch of new friends I can play with often! 

I can't wait until next week and I am sorry if this story didn't interest you but I felt like instead of talking smack after beating these ass holes, I'd come to Reddit and share a nice experience. (This can be my way to stick it up them) 

EDIT: Ok so I made an error my tier was 3 not 4! Also we've found out that the plebs who abused me weren't even in the 3000s MMR they just lied about it for some reason.

I need help to get payout from sale of items in steam Workshop...|self.DotA2|~Hello guys,
I was a Dota 2 amateur Tournament admin back in time once it was really a thing. I spent lots of my time and efforts and conducted some tournaments successfully. From sale of tickets of these tournaments I made some money (although it is very less, but still...). I had to get that money out from my steam workshop account to my back account. There was no way (automatic) to get that money, so I contacted steam support via a ticket. They generically referred me to a support topic. I replied to that topic and from then onward, steam is silent. Here is a screenshot of that ticket;

https://imgur.com/a/8IZDJ

So, now I cant open a closed ticket because its more than 30 days old and there is no way to contact steam about it. They say they automatically make payments, but interestingly, I have not received even a single penny till now.


So, I would request help from community to please tell me how to proceed ? Specially ones who work with steam workshop that how do I get a payout from my workshop account.

Thanks a lot and sorry for bad English.~|personal
So DotA 2 is the hardest game ever...|self.DotA2|~Post might be entirely pointless.  But holy crap I've tried DotA for a few days and my god its complicated.  

This is coming from a former plat LoL player, top 50 raid tank in WoW/2.2k arena rating, winner of Super Smash Bros melee tournaments(TLDR;Nothing special but somebody who's done plenty of competitive gaming) and I can't get over how overwhelming this game is.

Like props to you guys, I really wish I was younger(time) because this seems like so much fun to get into, but something you just have to dedicate time to learning.  Like I start with EVERY CHAMP WHAT.  There's a courier?!  You kill your own minions and zomg secret shops and stuff.  Every time I start up the game I poop myself because idk wtf I should be doing haha.

Anyway, this is pretty much just a fluff post.  If there's anyway you guys think somebody with limited time could learn the ropes of DotA 2 I'm all ears.

I mean my brain can handle a lot of micromanagement but this game...so painful...so compelling...~|personal

Not because I want to win the game.

It's simply enjoyable to see them suffer.

~Open letter to Valve & Dota2 Community | About Match-fixing and SA Scene~|self.DotA2|~Hello, my name is Bryan Freddy Machaca Sia,  also known as Smash. As many of you know, I have been pulled apart indefinitely from Valves competitive scene. Up to now, It's been almost two years since the ban was announced and I feel like it's time to write a letter explanining lots of details that are still unknown by many of the public. I'd like to clarify that this text doesnt meant to create feelings of pity towards me or my teammates, nor even justify my actions. I just think that, after two years, its fair that you guys know the full story and that we arent really bad people.
 
First of all, I'd like to publicly apologize to Valve. I'd like to sincerely apologize for any trouble that we have caused to their organization and for tarnishing the names of pro players everywhere with our actions. Valve has always seeked to promote sportsmanship and fair play and our actions didnt reflect those values.
 
Secondly, I'd like to apologize to all the members of the Dota community. Players, our fans, professional players, organizations, and all of those amazing people that compose this beautiful community did not deserve the trouble that we caused them and for that we sincerely apologize. I hate and blame myself for being such a naive person and for not fully realizing the consequences and magnitude of our actions at the time.
 
Currently, I have been banned for almost two years from the competitive scene. It is frustrating, you know? Not being able to compete in the game you love the most. I dont wish this feeling even to the worst of my enemies; watching your dreams fell down because of your own dumb actions due to immaturity, inexperience, and the lack of proper advice. It stopped me from reaching my dreams and from pursuing a career that Im truly passionate in.
 
Maybe now its too late to be talking about this but I never had the space or the opportunity to do it before. I was always terrified of saying or doing something as I thought this would only make the situation turn worst and that people would not believe my words. Now, two years have passed. Maybe the hardest years of my life, in fact, but a time that helped me mature in many aspects nonetheless. Living every day of your life acknowledging that you have been banned from your passion is a hard thing and it took me very long to accept this fact. Now, though, having fully accepted my current situation, Id like to explain the circumstances that led to the events in question.
 
Back in the days, we were a group of youngsters that had a common goal - being professional Dota players and playing against the best. Back then, saying these kind of things seemed like a joke as everyone simply watched the videos posted by legengs like LodA, Vigos, or Yaphets (thanks to them I started professionally) and revered them as gods or something simply unachievable. However, this view we had changed when we formed our first team. We wanted to improve to become as good or, if possible, better than they were.
 
For this common goal I dedicated years of my life to this game and made many sacrifices along the way to follow my passion. One of these sacrifices were the ties to my family. I lived in a province that is quite far from the peruvian capital, called Tacna. Tacna simply did not have the players or the tournaments to sustain my dream so, not even a decent internet connection. Because of this, I was forced to move to the capital. However, due to the lack of economic resources in my family, I had to go there alone and sustain myself. There was simply no chance of playing from Tacna as the competitive level I was playing against was huge and I needed a proper training.
 
At first, gaming in Peru was not easy whatsoever. In 2013, there were no organizations that supported players that wanted to be professionals; only cyber cafes/lan centers and small teams formed by friends. Nobody wanted to invest in Esports in Per and many players had to live off their own savings. However, when I was in my first team, Artyk Gaming, we were lucky enough to get a small space to play lent to us thanks to a friend of ours. Many teams back then lived in deplorable conditions, from little to no earnings, but that did not break the passion and commitment we had with Dota 2. Everything was quite harsh for me and my fellow teammates, especially since we all came to the capital from different parts of Peru. We were alone and we didnt use to socialize with other people either. It was hard as many days we were unable to fulfill basic necessities. There were even days where my teammates and I had no food to eat and no place to sleep. These kind of mishaps, though, helped us bond and created a very strong and united team. We survived all of this because we had a common goal - becoming a powerful team with global presence that could represent the Latin American community and further the improvement of such a community.
 
To be honest, I regret not speaking about this before, as many people believe that our actions held malicious intent or that we were attempting to take advantage of a bunch of people. Most people werent aware of our living conditions at the time or even now.
 
Two years ago, our economic situation wasnt particularly great and that is why we decided to leave the Not Today organization to seek a better future. Before we left, however, the owner of Not Today asked that we return all the money that he had invested in us. I dont know how much he asked for from each individual player but I know he asked me that I needed to return all the money I made from the MVP title I won at The Summit 2 by Beyond the Summit tournament (10K dollars). I was very nave as I could only think about one thing, and that was playing Dota. I was unaware of how a proper gaming organization functioned - how our earnings were handled, how they dealt with sponsors, etc. Its due to this that I was scammed many times, maybe even more times and I don't know about it. But in that time I believed that it was all good, that I could simply win more money by playing more - a big mistake. Even today I regret not fighting for that money I had to give.
 
After so many incidents we decided it was a best idea to play independently and a friend of ours, luckily, allowed us to use his basement to practice. Yep, no fancy house, just a small damp basement. On top of that, due to Perus terrible and unstable internet, we had two options - pay large amounts of money for a good connection or stick to a bad connection and somehow make it work. We obviously chose the second option as we simply didnt have the money and tried to make it work. Again, the money was an inconvenience because the little money we had saved up from our trips was depleting and we were running out of money for food.
 
This is when we decided to seek a new organization to represent us so that we could at least have a stable diet (and by stable I mean eating every day). That is when we finally joined Elite Wolves and it was good for a while. I had a salary of $90 which was quite a lot for the time. Back then a peruvian proplayer earned between 30-90$ a month (and 90 was still a fringe value reserved for those that  were lucky enough to find a generous organization). Sadly, with that amount of money we could not cover the basics. Especially regarding food. Most days we ate cold cereal or whatever we could muster. Most people thought that we made tons of cash, but they are now starting to realize that this is simply not true and we did not live the lavish life that everyone said we did. It seems like a dumb clarification but it is important to note that it was a huge sacrifice to be a pro player in Peru, back in the day. At the end of the day we kept at it because it was what we loved to do and the sacrifice was worth it.
 
Many organizations back in the day made a good amount of money and they took advantage of the talent and navete of many players. Nobody ever said anything because it might hurt one's career to speak out and they cant predict the communitys reaction but at this point I think everyone deserves to know the truth. We fought with tooth and nail to improve the conditions of pro players in the Peruvian community and we gave it our all so that we could accomplish our dreams.
 
This leads to another problem. When the match fixing scandal occurred, it was our manager, someone with whom we had had many problems in the past, who spoke to Valve exclusively. He was one of the many people that took advantage of our lack of experience and we still had a couple unsolved monetary issues with him as well. To this day I am still unsure what kind of communication he held with Valve but we never had the opportunity to express our version of the story.
 
There were many things that motivated our team to match-fix. Theres a point when you are close to shutting down due to desperation that you start to make bad decisions. Some people in the team had no money for food or to live on and what little we had to share was not enough to help them. I was not the one who coordinated the matchfixing, as I would have never been able to incite or motivate others to take such decisions. The truth is that I just followed my teammates, even if I didnt agree with them. That was my worst mistake and it led me to being involved with something that ruined my career.
 
I have always been an introverted person but I was recognized due to my Dota prowess and the advancements I made in the community. That is why people started to follow me and the hispanic community gave me a lot of their love. Some people still hold to that positive feeling to this day, despite everything that happened.
 
We have a great community that supports us, not just from Peru but from many Hispanic and non Hispanic countries as well. The support from these people and their words of encouragement are what help me keep going as a competitive player in Dota 2.
 
I dont look to excuse myself in front of your eyes, I am only writing this so that everyone understands the conditions that pro-gamers lived under in Peru. I want people to acknowledge that, back then, organizers took advantage of players due to their lack of experience and ignorance.
 
Recently, this has changed but only slightly. Many organizations dont say anything but they continue to exploit players and those who seek retributions are quickly swept under the rug. We were at the forefront of the e-sports movement in Peru and we wanted to open a path for the community to follow so that nobody would have to live under our conditions or suffer the exploitation that we suffered.
 
We were also the first Peruvian team to gain international recognition. We hoped, despite our failings, that we could help our community grow to the point that itd be recognized as a powerhouse internationally for all the untapped talent that is still present here.
 
We are glad to see that new Peruvian players have managed to participate in big tournaments, such as The International, as it is a dream that we all share here, but we also feel frustrated at our inability to complete for the same dream. 
 
In case many of you are wondering, we continue to play to this day and we compete in the few tournaments that allow us to participate. We dedicate ourselves entirely to these tournaments but every day there are stronger and better prepared teams as more and more teams are able to compete internationally.
 
These past two years we have fought against our own frustration for being sanctioned. Many people promised to help us, like the organization Thunder Awaken (the last team we were a part of). In the end, they were little more than snake oil vendors who did not stick to their word. We didnt publicly state this as some people still hope that one day our ban will be revoked. However, I have to continue forward but my emotional stability is depleting. My skill level has decreased, mainly due to the lack of motivation I feel due to being banned, and I wish you guys understood how hard it is for one to do their best with that burden on their mind. Sometimes, I even think that in our last tournament, The Final Match, we could have performed better. We did what we could, given our situation. Recently, though, Ive met many people that been trying to guide me and that have cheered me on to continue improving and fighting for what I love.
 
Currently, I stream daily on Twitch. When I stream I teach and share my experience to whomever wants to listen. I offer classes to casual players, I share my matches, ...  Essentially I do whatever I can to continue to support  the community that has given us so much over the years. I love Dota and it is my only passion. I have not stopped playing Dota a single day since I was banned.
 
My last goal was to achieve 10k MMR before the ranked system changed to the new one. I fought day in and day out to achieve this goal. I fought against myself, against my own frustration, and I just try to carry on with my life. I was really close to the goal buy I didnt make it. I would love it if you guys could continue to support me in my journey.
 
Finally, before I conclude this letter, Id like you guys to know that every word written in this statement comes accompanied with the grief that I feel. They are written from the heart and soul of a proplayer whose goals are no longer possible but who dares to dream and keeps his hopes up for a miracle some day.
 
Many people have told me to leave Dota aside. They said I should start a new path elsewhere. I dont know, I love Dota and I dont think its possible for me to leave it. I will give everything I have until I am physically forced to step aside to continue with my life outside of Dota. Regardless, I dont want anyone to think ill of me or my team.
 
For now we are young but in a couple years we will be old. Events like these are the ones that truly make you mature and realize that a single decision can drastically impact your life. I have many dreams and goals that have become unachievable due to this ban. This is why Im asking you, if this letter reaches anyone from Valve, please consider lifting or setting a time limit for my ban. I apologize profusely for all the trouble caused, both to Valve and to the community as a whole, and I will continue regreting my decision the rest of my life, regardless of what occurs going forward.
 
With this letter I pray that those who know me and those who dont, understand the reality of Esports and organizations in Peru. I also hope you understand the nature of my actions and what factors motivated me to commit them. More importantly, though, I hope that this letter reaches someone with dreams akin to mine and it motivates him to pursue them, as we are all dreamers at heart. I know that with this letter we wont make all the hatred disappear but I hope that those who hate us blindly at least question their feelings before doing so.
 
Thank you,


Bryan Freddy Machaca Sia

Something special happened after a game I played!|i.imgur.com||personal
'Free to Play' was on ESPN and my dad got curious|self.DotA2|~He started asking so many questions like "is this the game you play all the time?", "How do you play it?" and I had to think for a second on how I could explain about all the intricacies of Dota such as the heroes, their roles, farming and etc. Then, I thought of a better solution. I said " Why don't you follow me and watch it at one of the pubstomps this coming week?" He said "Won't that be weird since I'll be the only old guy there?" 

I've been watching football with my dad since I was 7 but I can't believe I get to say I'll be watching Dota with my dad :')

EDIT : It was on Astro Supersport instead of ESPN, my bad.~|personal esports

Dota 2 Charity Stream For My Dad|self.DotA2|~Hi all,

My dad was recently diagnosed with Motor Neurone disease at the age of 55. He's been given five years to live, and I'd like to raise money for MND Association (https://www.mndassociation.org/) . The only thing I can really imagine myself doing for this is streaming dota. I'm doing a triathlon next year but I am in no state to do that yet! Would you guys watch that? I'm 2.8k, trash, but i'd probably get drunk and play Basshunter - Dota on repeat and try to make it enjoyable. 

Please let me know if this would interest anyone.

EDIT: Link to stream for those interested, will arrange a date in the next few weeks if this gains traction!

To the couple of people wanting proof, I'll provide this when I'm closer to streaming. I'm at work at the minute.

6 boys from Slovakia looking for accommodation for ESL One Katowice|self.DotA2|~Hello, we are 6 friends from Slovakia and Katowice should have been our very first event. Unfortunately, our AirBnB got canceled just now, and we can't find suitable replacement (either very far away or too expensive).

We only want to go from 23.-25. february.
We are all males, from 21 to 23 years old.
We can offer around 50-60 euro per night.
(We have ranks from Archon to Divine 5 rank 900 if anyone is interested lol)
If you anyone from Katowice could help us somehow, we would very much appreciate it. You can coment here or PM me.

Thank you

Edit: thanks for the upvotes ,we didnt really expect it and we really appreciate it. Those of you who suggest that it is easy to find AirBnB or something else with 50-60 euro per night, we would be really thankful if you posted link too, because we really tried finding stuff before posting this here.


Edit2: Thank you guys for everything, we tried most links you posted here,but most are full when we contacted them during those dates, some are still too expensive and some have very strict policy (you need to come before 22:00 which we probably wouldnt be able to do). So the search still continues ! But we really appreciate all your efforts. Thank you!!~|personal

Help! Disqualified from sea qualifiers for bizzare reason.|self.DotA2|~We recently secured an invite to the LAN finals of the [New Blood Championship 2017(in Jakarta, Indonesia](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/events/717-new-blood-championships-2017)). But got an email stating that we got disqualified for a bullsh*t reason. tl;dr at bottom


A bit of a backstory: We are Team Nomadic a young Mongolian team that competed in the NBC 2017 Rest of SEA open qualifiers and finished second place which directly qualifes us for the Main event as started in the rules. 
The tournament itself is aimed at 'up and coming' dota amateur teams and banned tier 1 sea teams. It has several regional qualifiers for countries like Philippines Vietnam etc and 1 Open qualifiers for the rest of the sea teams.(Also note that those countries could enter the rest of sea Open qualifiers too effectively having 2 qualifiers)

[The admins sent an email notifying us of our apparent disqualification 3 days ago claiming that were not based from the Sea region](https://i.imgur.com/rcmnVLi.png), which is quite a ridiculous statement for a lot of reasons;


Firstly Mongolian teams have historically always competed in the Sea region of any kind of qualifers. Which is quite understandable for anyone with basic geography knowledge or when any Mongolian dota player opens the client and glances at the pings (fyi its~~90 for Singapore, ~~120 Luxembourg and ~~100 for the empty Japan server)
Also they included The Mongolz in their banned Tier 1 players and teams section. which is a Mongolian team which they now claim is not a part of SEA.
But it's most ridiculous when you realise that even Valve themselves invited Mongolian teams to the Sea regional qualifiers of their events!.

The rules never stated the countries that they deem SEA region, their rules even included a mongolian team in their ban-list further confirming that mongolia is rightfully a part of the sea dota region.

[Last month we qualified for the Asus Rog masters Apac without any issues.](https://i.imgur.com/EJqk1ZF.png)

If we aren't a Sea team which region do we even belong to?

We are all young players(aged 17-23) that are sacrificing a shitton for a small chance of going pro and getting denied this huge opportunity is real dick punch for us. Especially considering that we qualified against a hundred+ teams fair 'n square and this tournament was supposed to be aimed at exactly players like us for aspiring Dota 2 players, to shine and showcase their talents. taken directly from their website. http://newbloodchampionships.com

Please help us recover our hard earned slot, we don't know what else to do now.

p.s english is not my first language(nor second) so please ignore typos etc

tl;dr Sea based team got disqualified after winning sea open qualifiers for not being sea based.

XiiTuzi blog @ Shanghai Major|self.DotA2|~For those who dont know, I am Helen XiiTuzi Xu and I work as a freelance translator for DOTA2 events. I worked at many events in the past few years, including TI3 to 5, MLG Columbus, Redbull Battleground, Nanyang, Frankfurt Major and more. I attended Shanghai Major as a translator, but ended being a part-time host and helped with managing some of the issues later on. Things Im about to write are my first hand experiences of this event and I hope to share with you. Honestly its a scary thing for me to do, because Im really afraid that tournament organizers will dislike me for this and wont invite me to future tournaments. Other tournaments had problems too but I felt the need to write about this tournament in particular because the problems are on a different scale.  


Lets start with invites. People talked about talent invites so you can dig that up yourself, but originally Jack and I were not on the translators invite list (this was confirmed by a Perfect World staff). It was bizarre to me that I wasnt invited because I have the most experience working at Chinese events. Jack was the on-stage interpreter for ESL ONE New York, Frankfurt Major and the last MDL. Jack and I were added to the list later on after people from the community talked to PW.  When I saw the invite email, it said my daily salary would be 500RMB/day, thats a third of my normal salary rate and all translators were to be paid 500RMB/day. I ignored that because I was so happy that I can be a part of the event, even if PW were to pay me nothing I wouldve still went, considering that I wasnt even invited in the first place.  


Upon arrival to Shanghai I was happy to finally land after a 12-hour flight from San Francisco and to see familiar faces. I arrived late at night to find out media days begin the next morning with first team leaving at 7:30AM. I was told that I would be needed to help with western teams, but the managers werent even notified about this beforehand. The photo-shoot location was a 35-minute drive away without traffic (an hour during peak hours) but normally these kinds of shoots are done within the hotel where players are staying. Complexity was scheduled as the first team but they refused to go that early, so they were scheduled to a later time of the day. MVP actually left the hotel at 8AM the next day. Information was given at a very slow rate and if information was wrong or changed we normally have to chase after PW staff for the correct ones.  


Group stage matches were often delayed due to technically difficulties. The two incidents I remember very clearly were Secret switching rooms and Spirit audio issues. Secret had their gears in one of the battle room the night before and tested everything except audio. One would assume with gears already set up match would start on time, but Secret was asked to switch to a different room for their first match because PW and production made a mistake of which game would be casted on main stream.  During the match Secret had audio issues with the intercom system, where you can hear yourself talking or weird loud noises randomly. Window system for everyone was in Chinese, but western players requested to have English versions installed so the tech team reinstalled the systems but with bootleg copies and no drivers were installed. The intercom system they used for the event was very faulty but even so, most teams did not use Team Speak during the event because of Service Pack issues from reinstallation of Windows and no drivers were pre-installed. According to the tech dude the intercom system sometimes damages the files on SSD (hes really cool but I didnt catch his name, everyone around just called him   shi fu).  


For Spirit vs. Vici, the game was already paused for 20 minutes by the time I walked pass their battle room and got grabbed in to help translate.  Under frustration with the intercom system, Team Spirit switched to Team Speak and Iceberg had audio issues; it literally took 5 people an hour to fix the issue. Relating to the intercom issue, Im sure many of you remember that loud screaming in the background during Mushis interview. In the middle of the interview someone screamed really loudly in Chinese and everyone just got startled. I found out after that it was one of the PW higher ups screaming at the intercom tech guy, saying that he doesnt want to hear any more problems. Other staffs gave him the nickname Captain Useless because he gave 0 contribution to helping situations. The day after screaming, he wanted to call all the team managers into a meeting at 11PM, just so he can formally apologize, some PW staffs talked him out of it because seriously who gives a fuck about him in the first place.  


Before talking about English production for Shanghai Major, I want to give you a background of KeyTV and Nanyang Cup English production. KeyTV consisted of Chinese speaking staff, while talents only speak English. There were awkward transitions where the panel would say lets hand it off to the casters and the camera doesnt cut to casters until 5 seconds later. The reason for this was that whenever the production team gave a queue to the talents or vice versa, a translator translated the message to the other party, making communication extremely inefficient and confusing.  


When KeyTV came in to the Shanghai Major, they said the equipment provided was bad and so they brought in some of their own, mainly wireless headsets. During the first two days of group stage, there were already conflicts between KeyTV, MarsTV, PW and Valve. Person in charge of KeyTV refused to talk to anyone from the MarsTV production team, and whenever a problem needed to be solved a PW or Valve staff would have to step in to supervise. Keep in mind that only the Chinese stream has immediate access to player camera feeds during matches, so it was crucial that other streams keep in touch with MarsTV, who was doing the Chinese production.  


This happened around 8:30AM and streams needed to be live before 9AM. When KeyTV were initially told that they would no longer be responsible for English production around 7:30AM, they lingered around trying to talk to Valve staffs, ultimately KeyTV were told to leave and when they finally left, they took all their equipment with them. On top of that the person in charge of KeyTV ripped some documents (mainly English versions of rundown and schedules) in front of us, claiming that those were their work because Bonnie translated those and Bonnie worked for them. They were even pushing Bonnie to leave with them, but Im glad she decided to stay and help. After KeyTV left, English production team on that day consisted of Thad and Bruno from Valve, Bonnie, Rob and Bryan from BTS, and a sound guy we borrowed from MarsTV. Talents and casters used worse equipment than what KeyTV had. The next day another group of Chinese production came in to take over and we got better microphones, but that was pretty much it. Bonnie still had to translate for the production team.  


During the two break days after group stage, I was told that there would be rehearsal on the day before main event. Production teams were to go to the venue at 7AM to set up, technical rehearsal at 3PM then general rehearsal at 7PM. It was around 6PM when I got notified that technical rehearsal didnt even happen yet. So guess what, rehearsal was cancel all together.  


First day of main event, I showed up at the venue at 8:30AM but was told that I wont have a badge. A PW staff took me inside the venue and left me at the make up room. I was stuck there for at least 2 hours. Although there were several other translators available, I found out I was scheduled for translating post match interviews the entire day, while Jack were to sub in for the need of an English host, also the entire day for the whole event. I immediately told whoever made the schedule that it was more reasonable to spread out the responsibilities amongst all the translators hired. He agreed and made changes, only for the next days (a reminder that day 1 of main event ended around 2AM). Then not long after, Jack told me that the stage host PW hired needed to leave after 5PM on weekdays for her radio job, so I would need sub in as the Chinese host after she leaves. Due to heavy delay of matches, she only did one post match interview that first day since the first series ended around 3PM. This was completely out of my comfort zone. I was extremely nervous about the job and felt very uncomfortable being thrown into that position on the spot. Luckily for me I had my buddy Jack going through this with me. Neither of us had any real hosting experience so I hope we didnt do a horrible job on stage. We tried helping each other with writing questions and watched out for each other.   


Workday hours for many people this event was from 7AM to 3AM and on the first day of the main event after everything ended, there werent enough shuttles to take all of us back to the hotel. The Russian production and some of us translators had to wait outside the venue at 2:40AM for shuttles to return from the previous trip to pick us up.  


Even when Jack and I were asked to sub in for host and help with other duties that werent meant for translators to do, we did those because it was an opportunity for us and we care about the event running smoothly. However that didnt mean we should be doing extra work for the salary we were going to be paid. PW never talked to us about a raise. I felt really abused during the third day of the event, it was almost time to clear out the venue, a staff came by the make up room to let me know that I was supposed to make the announcement of kicking people out of the venue. I was completely puzzled and had no idea why they would want me to make that announcement on stage right after the interview. A Valve staff next to me immediately said no, and asked whose idea was it for me to do such a thing. The staff replied, Anderson said Xixi (my Chinese name) can do it. I felt really abused that day, but honestly I wouldve done what they asked me to if the Valve staff didnt stop them, so Im really grateful to her for standing up for me.  


Moving onto the stage. The venue was huge and the stage looked amazing, but that didnt mean there were no issues. I remember after the first interview with Kuroky, the lights dimmed so stage area was pitch dark, I was wearing super high heels and I couldnt find my way down the stage in the dark because it was impossible to see where the stairs were. I waited for Kuro to finish packing then he tested for steps to get off stage and helped me walk down. The edge of the stage that lights up were plastic pieces glued together and whenever someone stepped on the parts that were glued together these pieces sunk in a little. I fell later that day and after that every time I get off the stage after an interview, two MarsTV staff waited by the stage to help me down. On the fourth day of the event they waxed the stage. I have no idea why anyone would do that but it was extremely slippery and people slipping were a big concern.   


By the fourth day of the event, only 4 translators had badges that let you enter the venue. Having only a few translators at the venue also meant that our responsibilities got heavier. At this point translators were responsible for stage duties, part-time hosting, subtitling the videos for Chinese and English production and helping teams out when there are issues, and there seem to always be issues.  On top of that the badges only allow access on the ground floor. What does that mean? It means we cant go up to the suites and we cant even go into the audience. I love watching games in the crowd with everyone else. I love the hype and energy. Jack and I used normal event tickets to watch 2 games of the upper bracket final between Secret and Liquid, and we had to walk at least 10 minutes all the way around the venue to do that, when there were elevators and doors literally a minute away from backstage. One of the translators Josh literally gave up on coming to the venue because he was sick of sneaking around. And on the last day I got stopped on my way to the stage area even though I had a backstage badge. Not to mention previous days I walked around without a badge, why didnt these guards do their job then?   


Despite all the things that went wrong for Shanghai Major, it is a valuable lesson for everyone involved. The purpose of writing about it is to share with you what I saw went wrong from my eyes, hoping for future events that everything will improve. Im not sure what Valve, Perfect World or other tournament organizers will think of me after this blog is released, but I think it is the right thing to tell the world my experience at this event. To everyone who worked really hard at Shanghai Major, thank you for caring about the community and having passion for the game we all love. Lastly a big shout out to Thad Sharon Bruno from Valve, Jasper ROC Peter Zeal from Perfect World, Danny Azi Langzi Mien Yuan Director from MarsTV, Rob Bryan from BTS, all the English talents, all the translators and team nannies, Steph Ryan Sean, and my buddy Jack. ~|personal esports
I feel sorry for 1k and 2k players trying to get better.|self.DotA2|~Almost 6k here. Was watching my little brother play today at 1.5k and it's a fucking head ache just spectating. I'm telling him to tell his team's to do certain things to go with the flow of the game and people even though they speak English refuse to listen. 3 people dead, 1 support up and people just go farm and call my little brother wrong for wanting to push with a drow,mirana and clinks after I told him to do it. Even when everyone speaks English trash at that mmr see that if it isn't 30+minutes they can't push for some reason. 4 games in a row watching him play he lost because his English speaking team didn't want to listen to basic Dota mechanics. 
I'm sorry to all you 1k and 2k players who are trying to get better but get stuck with people like this. The next game i pick clinks and solo and win the game by myself to prove to him it can be done alone. But holy shit it's a headache in that bracket. ~|personal

I miss my dota buddy. (and why we shouldn't take our friends for granted)|self.DotA2|~"Come play a pub with me, I'm bored!"
"No, I hate pubs"
"Fine."

So we played hard bots instead. He would pick the carry, and I would pick a mid hero. I'd either get 30 kills in a row with windranger, steal all his kills, or go batshit insane because bane bot wouldn't stop ulting me. We tore those bots a new ass. This continued for weeks; we would practise on bots, and beg each other to come on to play. Bots were an escape from the harsh reality of pubs.

But then my friends list was quiet. I hadn't played a bot game in over a month now. I checked his steam profile which simply said:

Last online: 28 days ago.

Was he hacked? No, he would of contacted me by email if he was.
Did he quit dota? No, he literally just bought a legion arcana set.

I sent him a few offline messages asking where the hell he was.
And one day, I got a reply. The first message to him was:

"OMG WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN??"

And then the kick in the proverbial balls came. He informed me he was diagnosed with cancer. Right in the feels. One day at university, the next day in hospital. I'd gone a month without knowing my best dota buddy had gone close to a hair away from dying, and that his cancer was discovered before it had spread. Currently he is undergoing chemotherapy, and I haven't talked to him for about 20 days now (which is when we last spoke.

You've probably got a lot of friends on your list that play dota, right? Do you play over 50% of your dota games with many of them? Have you actually played ANY games since you met? Your friends are people, and you must cherish them. This applies to games too: behind every hero is a real person: with real troubles and a real personality. 

Cherish your friends, because you never know the game you just played with them might be your last together; and theirs too.

To the professional players who read Reddit|self.DotA2|~An open letter to the professional DotA 2 players.

Earlier in my life I had aspirations of becoming a professional baseball player.  I wasn't highly regarded, but I had good enough stuff for some coaches and managers to take me seriously.  As with e-sports, baseball has it fair share of crony capitalists lurking for young talent to be taken advantage of. 

Talking with other players and former teammates within baseball solidified a few rules which I live by, not just in the sports world but in life:
1) ALWAYS get it in writing.
2) ALWAYS get it in writing.
3) Never work for promises.

The world of Tier-1 DotA 2 professional players has more bargaining power than they think they have. Team switching is a strong sign that owners can and will compete for top talent.  When discussing contract terms, the most powerful negotiating tactic for a player to say is, I liked what we discussed, but I'd like to see it in writing before I play for you. This protects you the player and the company to make sure the expectations are well defined and fulfilled with the threat of a lawsuit if one party doesn't uphold their end.  Organizations don't want bad press, and players want the security of being paid on time. Having a well defined contract increases the likelihood of this behavior.

I also think it is about time players hire an agent for themselves.  I will take baseball to be an example here.  When sitting down to negotiate compensation, a baseball player has a few options. Does he want a no trade clause? Does the player want a long term contract or a short term one? Does the player want a low salary but have incentives (read bonuses) to play better?  All of these things the baseball agent knows well and can counsel the player in getting the most of what he wants.  While agents do take a percentage of your income (winnings, sponsorships, or otherwise), they give you the peace of mind that you're not being screwed over.  I never made it high enough in baseball to necessitate an agent unfortunately, and my opinions are from stories from teammates who have and haven't had an agent when negotiating contracts.  One theme was consistent from these stories however; those players who negotiated with an agent obtained better contracts.

The last thing I must stress is that no matter how much help you get with the contract signing, *YOU* are the one responsible for making sure all proposals are in the contract. Not your lawyer, not your agent, **YOU**.  

The professional DotA 2 scene has survived a long time on trust between owners and players. Far longer than I would have imagined. The drama we are witnessing is much the same drama which made baseball players unionize. Owners were taking advantage of them.  Please players, protect yourselves and your livelihoods.  You have worked very hard to get where you are in life, don't let others be in control.

Sincerely,
--A DotA 2 Fan~|personal esports

I was robbed and shot.|self.DotA2|~About 3 months ago as I was walking home from going to the gym  was held at gun point, shot about two times (one thru the belly and one at my upper right shoulder part) I was so close to dying and I became paralyzed from the waist down since of the bullets hit my spine.

Fast forward to today, I'm still bed ridden and my right arm hasnt been functioning that well since thats where the second bullet entered, I need to constantly move it to get it to atleast how it used to be so I recently bought a new gaming laptop and play Dota2 to atleast help me getting used to using my right arm again (dont worry guys, ill only play with bots so i wont ruin your games)

Now the problem is that my steam guard authenticator was in my old phone. and since it got stolen I have no access to it. I already contacted steam but it seems like it would still take a long time, can some one give me any tips or advise on what to do to speed up the process? thanks, It really has been a tough couple of months and I believe a little bit of Dota2 would help me cheer up.

Dota2 from perspective of former master tier lol player|self.DotA2|~Hello guys, I have seen many posts like that, I want to share me experience to about league of legends and dota. First of all sorry for bad englando as it is not my native language.

So as title says I was former master tier player (it's probably like 6k elo in dota2 I guess). I always loved league of legends, I have been player of this game for like 5 past years. I started my 'carrier' around beta and sticked to it for next 5 years. 

Competetive matches were so fun to watch, there were a lot of tournaments in season 2 and season 3, probably best one was IPL5 but something went wrong and riot decided that agressive game is somehow bad for the game or for viewers and they cut it down. 

Competetive games now are boring as fuck, like seriously, 5 kills in 20 minutes is typical, teams are swapping lanes, afk farming and taking dragons. In League of Legends there is one word that can describe this and it's called *rotations* (memed to death). 

For like past year all I did was watching games and play like 2-3 games per week because I was getting nervous really fast after one lose, dropped from masters to like diamond 5 and completely lost motivation to play or climb.

After riot introduced that solo queue will not be comming back I decided to switch to dota 2.

First this game stunned me, there was so many things that I had to learn, 100+ champions, 500+ new skills, so many active items and new items (I still don't know how to build properly and follow builds or my friend advices) but it was **worth**

I'm really amazed by this game, I watched last major and competetive games looked so good although i didnt understand many things. I have been learning from watching and playing by myself (u guys even have replays, wow), this game is everything riot would like theirs game to be. It's much harder  to learn than LoL but after all it's worth, all you need to do is spend some time and don't get frustrated too fast, I just started my ranked carrier and hit 2,5k (I think it's not that bad for new player, is it?) and I hope that I'll be getting better and better.  I noticed things that riot 'stole' from you after I started playing dota, so many similiraties in skills, items or even champions.

What I wanted to write is that Dota2 is really good game, much much better than other moba's, there are a lot of unique champions, skills that aren't in other games and I hope more and more players from league of legends will switch to dota as I did and let riot kill their game on their own.

edit:
I know you guys are joking but I only spent 200 hours in Dota2 and hit 2,5k mmr compared to almost 4000 hours in league of legends so i don't think it's comparable ~|personal

Recently decided to really put some time into playing Dota. After a couple of brutal games... no regrets.|self.DotA2|~This game is fantastic. 

Early tl;dr I've come from League, played it for years, and only slightly dabbled in Dota here and there.

So I started playing Dota and the first thing I love, every hero is free. Not only that, but "hey, this character has a headpiece I really, really love, I wish I could have that. But eh, I don't feel like buying a ski- holy shit it's only 7 cents? Alright, yea. Let's go!"

The second thing I noticed when I started playing more heroes was that, wow, these skills and items are... well I guess I just have to say ballsy? Ballsy in that League would NEVER consider things like *stealing an enemy ultimate* or *becoming immune to magic and CC*. 

And finally, no runes and masteries? You're telling me that I can just go into a game, choose my hero, and my entire game will be based on how I adapt to who I'm playing against, and not pre-setup pages of things I grinded out? Oh hell yes. 

It really appeals to me how amazingly diverse and different every hero is, and how, at least in my experience so far, every hero I play can be used to dominate, instead of instantly being at a huge disadvantage. (Also, can we talk about the hero pool used in tournaments compared to champs used in League? Soooo much more diversity, everyone gets used!) 

Your price pools are insane, your heroes are amazing and delightful, your abilities are unique and refreshing, your items are HUGE crazy, and you're all a bunch of assholes in game but for some reason it makes me feel all warm inside. 

Big tl;dr go Dota.~|personal
A message to OG from a fan|self.DotA2|~Don't do it. Don't shuffle. Your fans are loyal, your brand is strong, your dota is masterful. So you lost 2 BO3s against arguably the two teams you were least prepared for. A slightly different playoff assignment would see you coasting to top 3. 

Cr1t, Miracle-, Moon, I know you guys are being courted and getting offers from every direction. Fuck that. Stay with the fam, fam. Show everyone it's through the highs and the lows. We, the fans, believe. 

Don't break our hearts. #DreamGreen.~|personal esports
Thank you Clockwerk|i.redd.it||personal
I stopped playing ranked. I don't remember the last time I had this much fun playing dotes.|self.DotA2|~I calibrated at 3.6k long ago and grinded my way up to 5555 MMR. The games were tedious. You could have a 1-hour long hard game and earned those precious +25 MMR points, and the next game had a Peruvian kid at mid getting killed once, tilting and feeding on purpose losing the MMR you worked hard to get in just a few minutes.

It was ok, though, as long as you won more games than lost. But if you wanted to win, you had to reduce your hero pool to just the few heroes you really knew how to play and perfect your game. Want to play a chill game with a hero you never play? Nah! I need MMR.

Then you had bad days where you lost 8 games in a row and lost 200 MMR leaving you sad like a pepe. But it was all worth it right? You FINALLY reached 5k. Every dedicated Dota player's milestone. You climb your way up to 5.5k even. You finally get to play games with other high performance players and have epic games right? WRONG! 

Valve's match making system doesn't work like that. Once you hit 5.5k, 9 out of 10 games will be you + at least three people who are 1200 MMR lower than you. If you want to reach 6k you have to be SO GOOD and focused you can carry four 4ks all by yourself, or else you get reported and called an account buyer. The trench never ends.

No thanks! I finally choose to have fun instead. I quit all of that and just play to have fun now. Last night I played Sniper, went Desolator, Aghs and rapier and was 1-shot killing both enemy supports with one spell. The other day was Aghs/Refresher Luna time. Orbital cannon! Dagon Techies is also a blast, and I finally get to practice Terrorblade and Shadowfiend, heroes I never bothered playing because I knew I was bad at them but was obsessed with playing ranked so there was no way I would try them.

I still get the "how are you 5k? you suck" comments whenever I try one of these meme builds and lose, but it was k.~|personal
Why this TI is important (to me)|self.DotA2|~Sorry but this story is going to be a bit "woe is me" and such.

So growing up I didn't have any friends. I was bullied and sunk into gaming because I needed an escape. It wasn't till I came across DotA that I actually felt happy. I would play DotA every second I could for 4 years (2014 - now). Sadly though, around this time my dad had begun to have a lot more work and travel on his plate. As I sunk more and more into my games, he had more and more work to do. We drifted apart and it got to the point that I just disliked talking to him because we were so different. He would argue with me about everything, especially how much time I spend on DotA.

Just recently I actually began talking to my parents about the friends I had made online from DotA. People I treasure so much. And as they found out more about them, they began to question me more and soon realised that they know nothing about me except for the surface level.

So my dad asked if I wanted to spend a week with him somewhere, so him and I could reconnect and be father and son again. Seeing as I always hear about his day at work, and when ever I would talk about my games it would just spark an argument about health and such, I thought that him and I could go to TI so he could understand not only what game I play but also the community around it. The people that although can be toxic, in the end are some of the loveliest people you can meet. 

This is my first TI ever, and although I am sad that I won't see the final live. I'm happy that I will finally get to show my dad what my life is like. Show him that games aren't just some mindless button spamming and yelling. I will finally get to connect with someone who should have been there for me through some shitty times, and I will get to see a bit into him that isn't just arguing with me and being a doctor.


TL;DR - Me and my dad will be reconnecting after years of sinking into our own separate lifestyles. This will be my first TI and a chance to show my dad what my life is like~|personal

Life of a Korean Dota 2 Tier 2 player.|self.DotA2|~   Hi. I'm ghettokid79 a.k.a Bangfish, probably known as that guy who plays with sing (or used to ) or that guy who writes blogs about proplayers once a year or so. I was gonna write something about the MVP players before TI, to bring up the hype and shed some light on my beloved players, but this letter which was posted on a korean dota forum just seemed much more urgent. It ticked something inside me. A mixture of regret, anger and all sort of animesque emotions started bursting out of me. Reminding me of my old days, when I used to dream of being a top tier dota 2 player, which I gave up rather quickly. Maybe I wasn't desperate enough, maybe I wasn't talented enough, maybe I wasn't diligent enough, maybe I didn't have the guts to do it. Or maybe life as a tier 2 player just fucking sucks and its not worth trying at all. Personally this memory of givng up your dream haunts me rather frequently and its god damn fuckign annoying. On top of that, it feels amazing when it's not the game itself that made u give up on your dreams, but those exterior life factors that kicked you in the ass strangled you to give up. 

   This letter reminded me of that moment when I first thought 'man. fuck. gaming as a career, this shit ain't worth it' after meeting the owner of FXO(famous for it's rather huge and successful sc2 squad). Dude was suspicious as fuck and had this vibe that i didn't want to be related in anyway. His whole business, and korea e-sports in general, is just a huge shitshow based on abusing young naive talents to make some money, and not share them. Since I didn't wanted to be part of this shady organization and March did, this resulted in me and my team(March, Sagun, Ranto) to part ways. After that I kinda gave up on becoming relevant and headed on to college. And it haunts me until today. (OH GOD WISH I TRIED. FUCK. BUT THE SYSTEM WAS SO ASS.)  Well this is another story, so let's move on. You will probably catch more about this in my stream, which is probably gonna happen later in this year!! Also my steam is offline for like 200 days. plz dont delete me my fellow steam friends. I'm coming soon.

   In this thread I will translate something written by shuma, a 7k support player who used to play in the MVP teamhouse, which accuses the reality of a tier 2 player in Korea. Some might say "they didn't win anything why do they deserve anything", don't know about you guys, but to be honest I'd rather not dip my feet into this exploitation structure in the first place even if I have the talent and will to success. I wish to share this piece of information with you guys to help people protrait how the life of a tier 2 player actually is. Also wish you can understand about the ecosystem here, and we can start making the scene more player/talent friendly than it is now. Also hope people would be more aware of how dangerous it is to fantasize about this whole scene.

   Fyi Shuma() streams and he is a pretty talented support player who plays mostly on china server. One of my personal favorite streams nowadays. Not sure if he speaks english tho. He probably reads and types decent english since hes korean. go check him out. https://www.twitch.tv/skk974

	[Current Status of Korean Dota. ]         -Writer Shuma 

Korean Dota consist of only 1 team and I guess y'all know which team it is.
Imma gonna write only about 100% pure facts about this team.

I was a abid fan of MVP aegis and MVP hot6, and also part of it as a player.

My personal belief about a 'team' is that 'team' should grow and increase in potential via scrimming in regualr schdules.
There are other stuff(personal talent, amount of practice and positive feedback environment) that are important, but scrimming hard should have the utmost importance.
Frankly speaking you are giving up your whole youth to be a pro, this should be basic stuff. Disappointingly this was not true.

My first impression of the MVP teamhouse was 'ah, just a lan cafe huh'
It was nothing of a try-hardy environment even to the eyes of a newcomer like me. 
This was around september 2013, when both teams(aegis and hotsix) were active.
Since I didn't know every personal circumstances of the palyers and maybe it had a more free environment, I just let it through.

Time flows and nothing imporves. Not a single thing.
(I was a sub-member, outsider, solo-rank warrior. Hence I could observe this in a rather rational point of view.)

Frequent fights among players. Pathetic amount of practice. Is this for real? are they even trying to go pro?
MVP phoenix players and a few diligent players talked about this issue to the coach but till 2016 nothing really changed.

Could really tell that everyone was annoyed and no one could maintain a positive attitude.
After scrims, players always argued with each other. Feedbacks? LOL nice joke.
It was a fucking disaster. I heard MVP had interviews before they recruit trainees. Did these guys really pass the interviews? holy fuck.

Everyday there are these trival torubles everywhere, and no one trys to fix that. Players and staffs both.
This escalated to our tournaments and MVP A was almost on the verge of disbanding.
So the staffs put up a deal at 2016, that every player should at least reach 6k mmr to stay in the team house.
I thought this was a chance for me, even though I was kicked from the main roster twice, i had 6.5k mmr 
I had no doubt that i was gonna be on the main roster. I didn't even thought about how much of a bullshit deal this was back then.

2017, everyone under 6k mmr went home and the rest of us becomes MVP hot6
No one on our team could play carry, so the youngest of us(who was me) played carry.

Our scrims were pretty good. We would win against execretion and signiture trust. We weren't exactly the worst team in the universe.
We even won against Youngminds 2:0 at the Mr.cat tourney
It seemed pretty good we were becoming a solid team.

And suddenly someone who left the mvp teamhouse comes back
the staff insists that we should swap out someone to make this team better
and I was forced to become a sub in this team. 
During a scrim game I kinda gave a few bad orders which resulted in a loss and right after that game I was forced to sub for this team.
Like seriously? I had the 2nd highest mmr, I have the longest practice hours. And I'm just kicked? oh well

After that I couldn't help myself on thinking negatively about how this whole mvp thing thinks about their players and player's future.
You let someone who left come join a team and kick someone whos been working hard. Great stuff. Is there even a point to try hard in this place?
The new Hot6 eventually blew up in a bad way and around april 2017 it was worse than ever. And to your surprise not a single coach gave a fuck.
fights gets worse and no one takes control of this situation.

At march, the few leftovers who are staying here make the last version on hot6.
Honestly scrims werent that bad. We had potential and shit.
Thought we had a chance if we just had some time.
But shit happens.

Our most quiet player got mad and was raging. And the Coach just comes up and tell the player to go home.
Like seriously? go home? where in the world does a coach just tells a player to go home.
did he even think before he said that? i doubt that. 
he literally didnt give a single fuck during the few years and randomly comes up and says fuck off. what a joke.

After that hot6 disbands and the rest is left alone all playing solo ranked.
the coach came up with a brilliant idea that players should climb 350 mmr points every month
and at the end of 2017 everyone should get 8.5~~9k mmr.

This is the facts about my time during MVP.
From now on i will talk about my personal opinions.

MVP A scrimed RRQ and won 2:0 at 2016.6
They actually played pretty good
even had a good run at open qualifiers
but no one from the mvp staff gave a fuck.

well i guess the coach was busy with MVP phoenix
and i thought that the the players individually didnt try hard enough.

But while i was playing in the 2017 MVP hot6 I felt something.
'youngminds' who we won against last year alwasys climbed to top 16 consistantly in the TI OQs
'ulrica' a chinese team we never lost to climbed to top 8 in the TI OQs 
before i joined MVP, when i was on team 3154, we used to scrim 12 hours a day
after 2 weeks we could win almost every tier 2 sea team and stand against WG pretty evenly
I strongly believed that if someone could lead us to have proper scrim schdules and practice regulary we could do better
I told this at out monthly meeting session and no one actually gave a fuck.
If you(MVP STAFFS) aint gonna take authorization and help us get better at least give it to us so we can actually try.
If you actually cared we(MVP A MVP 6) could actually be a decent team. But u didnt care.


Besides all the trainees were given a bed to sleep and food and a additional 100 bucks every month for allowance. 
Like during weekends no one cooks for us so we have to buy food at weekends.
I thought of this 100 bucks as the magistrate for my life standards.
But they kinda didnt believe that was our right and started to not pay us that 100 bucks everyonce in a while. so oh well...

btw the coach havent been on dota ever since 2017.5.23
i dont even know the purpose of all this MVP dota thing
I dont know anything
I kinda wanna talk more but dunno i guess i gotta go.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

well thats it. Shuma's rant about his run to go pro in dota in some raw language.(kinda lost interest in translating it into edible pieces. Can feel that he just went down with rage. gotta respect it and go with it.) I doubt that even mvp phoenix didn't got the respect and care they deserved ever since March left. March was basically everyones big bro and made sure everyone was treated well and paid well. After March left you can see that the whole squads all over the world like dragon balls. Like how does a TI6 top6 team just evaporate in thin air.  I wonder why. 

TLDR : life sucks, life of a tier 2 dota 2 player sucks more.

An update on my situation - Chessie, former player for [A]|self.DotA2|~Hello guys!

I'll try to keep this as short but informative as possible. As some of you know, I transitioned to Dota from Heroes of Newerth during the summertime -14. I had been playing high level matchmaking for a few months already by then, so there were some offers from various teams after TI which was when I wanted to go competitive because top-tier teams will reshuffle and have spots available. Anyhow, I ended up playing for Alliance. After a few weeks my problems slowly began, first with pains in my shoulder-blades but shortly after the pain started spreading to neck and shoulders. I immediately started visiting a well-known naprapath for treatments, but with no effect. Having constant pain, even when I'm not on the computer, is not a fun thing and it had a big impact on my social life. I tried to keep playing, with experts telling me that I should get rid of this injury if I just changed my daily patterns and started going for walks, stretching, doing physical therapy and so on. But nothing worked, the pain was always there. My situation was really bad because on one hand, I wanted to start winning tournaments and prove myself, but then again my pain was getting worse and my gameplay was so poor. I was always the guy playing matchmaking all the time when not scrimming, but during my time with Alliance I couldn't play matchmaking at all so I was limited to play scrims and officials. We managed to qualify for WCA in China, ESL One New York and Starladder season 10, but I wasn't feeling like playing at all at this point. After consultation with my naprapath & chiropractor as well as my psychologist, I still went to China to participate in WCA, even though I wanted Alliance to go with a stand-in instead. This did not make things better and my trip just wasn't enjoyable, even though we had great results and it was a fun experience outside of the pain I experienced. I decided before we went home that I wouldn't keep playing before this injury had fully healed, so Alliance went with Hanni and Apemother instead for the upcoming LAN-events.  
&nbsp;


After this I went kind of underground, didn't want to log into Steam because everyone was always asking me how I'm progressing, when I can play and so on. I started experiencing heavy dizziness and other symptoms, which my doctors thought were related to anxiety and stress so they gave me useless medicines which made things worse. And even though I have done every single treatment possible, probably visited over 10+ different experts nothing seems to be working. I was asked to stop playing games and focus on other stuff in my life, and so I did only play about 1 game every 2-3 days for quite a while. But living a life with constant pains and without my passion which is games is not a fun thing to do.   

&nbsp;

So now I'm beginning a new kind of treatment which seems very promising, and I am also taking a different direction and approach towards my problems. As long as I take breaks between games, live a generally healthy lifestyle with a lot of exercise it is not believed that my injury will get worse while playing. My mental state of mind might be very important to begin healing, so writing this post is my first step in the right direction, talking about it openly instead of just playing games on my sub-account in secret.  

&nbsp;

Anyhow, enough with that. As of today, I will SLOWLY begin playing more games, and stream my rehabilitation on twitch.tv/chessie. The first few days I will only play 2-3 games each day, then I will take it from there and see what happens. I barely made the 15 games necessary in the past 21 days to show up on the leaderboards and I've got a MMR of 7100 right now, so that's a start. Going on various treatments every week is expensive, so this is my way to try to both get an overall higher quality on life to be able to heal, and also make myself some money as I cannot perform a regular job like this.   

&nbsp;

If there's any questions you got for me I will try to be active with my chat in my stream as I do not expect to hit high viewer numbers from the beginning and thus it should be easy to answer whichever questions you may have.

Thanks for your time!
/end rant

&nbsp;

Quick update, thanks for everyone tuning in to the stream and thank you for all your kind words! I didn't wanna go too in-depth on every specialist I've visited, but I've been to multiple doctors, done various scans and tried every treatment I've gotten recommended. Doctors, physical therapists, therapist, naprapath, chiropractor, acupuncture, the whole charade. This is high-end specialists in Sweden who I have full faith in, alot of them who are working with Swedish professional athletes in regular sports. I will be back with more streaming tomorrow! ~|personal esports
I'm a bad player|self.DotA2|Today I was in a bot match practicing my early Lycan jungle and I looked at the map and saw that my sniper was alone in the safelane going against a dual lane without a support. I said to myself "Why is sniper alone what retard decided to jungle." It was me. I was in jungle. I'm a bad player|personal
As techies, my primary objective is to mine and defend. My secondary objective? To tilt the enemy.|self.DotA2|~It's two minutes in. We've collected the rune from the already disgruntled juggernaut in the top lane. He hopes he will regain his lost bounty, with the warmth of a fresh creep wave and a pushed lane. Think again, juggernaut. First blood rings across the screen as the juggernaut explodes, his mask tossed asunder as my mines have their righteous way with him. I've already collected what gold he's mustered, I am growing more and more powerful.

I reach level three as he reaches lane. He's already frustrated, my lane mate goes to fountain, I'm weak, a vulnerable little techies left to be mercilessly ravaged by juggernaut's superior strength and right click abilities. Once again juggernaut, your actions betray you. I've planted yet another mine stack, my swiftness and discipline paying off. He's been left with 20 health, a calculated maneuver as I perform the rigorous math theorems to measure each stack's damage after reductions. Death crawls upon him and gives chase, with the sound of the techies attack animation. He is running as the burning projectile flies through the air, streaming for his blood in the cold air. As it collides, I've collected my prize and I type into the chat, a single solitary question mark. 

He's angry - He thinks he can still win the lane. Nay, poor juggernaut. I have won the lane. I have won the game. He finally reaches his level six, and his teammates are furious. If he loses against me again, he will certainly be flamed. His arms quake as he readies his ult. Juggernaut, you've activated my trap card. As you attack me with your ult, I dash with the added speed of my wind lace, soon to be turned into a euls with this time's feed, into a mine pile. He knows it's the end of his pathetic life, and he is destroyed instantly. I already hear the gnashing of his team's teeth. I've thrown him to the wolves of his own pack. 

Axe comes to gank. They coordinate an attack on me, those poor souls. Axe calls me, catching me still with only half of my health. He thinks me a fool, but little does he know that I've activated my greatest ability, I have just enough mana for do my power as I detonate my mines. Axe is obliterated by my swift talons of justice, and juggernaut is once again left with 100 health. I use my euls. As he turns through the air, feeling the breeze on his skin as the cinder of his teammates brings a sting to it, the techies loom below him, a shark in the water. I explode in holy fire as I cleanse this lane from this cabal of unworthy ones. 

First objective? Successful, as every rat attempt by the pathetic juggernaut is met with swift fiery justice, my boots enabling rapid speed across the map to mine my towers. You think you've got our t2? I draw it out. With every attack you bring the tower closer to demise. You think they're there, you for a fleeting moment of clarity among the ashes that you'll be spared my obliteration, but you're wrong. I take your tower from you, I steal it as swiftly as the owl severs the spine of a baby bird. 

Second objective? As we take the throne, among the ruins of what may have been the enemy team's friendship, flaming erupts. Blaming, reporting, hating. Before I leave, I type a single sentence. "Ez". As I leave from the immolation of the enemy team's unholy rage, I smirk. Objective two accomplished. My techies winrate ascends to 79.6. I've failed. I must train harder. ~|personal

First time on reddit|self.DotA2|~Hey guys,  

Normally don't post, usually come on here to see if Steam is down (which, it is lol).

Been cracking up at some of these posts.  I have been playing Dota 2 for a year or so now, never played a game like this before (Counter-Strike for 10 years lol). Really enjoy it, after 2200 matches I am still learning and having a blast

Good to see you all, hopefully the servers come back soon.~|personal

Not only did I win, but I encountered NO BM from anyone; it was great.  The Sven I was supporting was amazing; even though he only spoke Spanish he was able to give me a couple tips.  At one point he wrote "polvo doctor"...which clued me in that I needed to start buying Dust of Appearance.

The kill score was fairly even but the other team just could not push objectives for whatever reason, even after wiping us out in a big teamfight.  We lost a grand total of one tower.

I'm downloading that replay and keeping it forever!

Um...that's it.  I'm just excited.

Goodbye DreamLeague /Producer|self.DotA2|~Hello all, 

I think most of you don't know me, which is in place. Despite this I just wanted to do a post here since today was my last day of producing DreamLeague. I've been working with DreamLeague since season 3 and it's been quite a journey. 

Browsing reddit after each broadcast and listening in to your continuous feedback has been a daily routine, and since I'm not a regular writer here I just want to take the chance of saying thanks. You've all had great input throughout the years and many times been a great inspiration to all the buttons that we've been doing in the broadcasts (which is like way over fifty or so).

Also I would like to thank all the great people involved working with DreamLeague since this has been a huge team effort. Especially all the talent that are doing an amazing work in front of the camera. Sheever, Slacks, Draskyl, ODPixel, Shane and all the guests and other talent that been guests in the studio during my time with the project. 

It's also easy to forget all the other extremely talented people working with this project. Not only in-house at DreamHack, but also freelancers like Marcin, Edje, Skruff, Weppas and the guys over at datdota. You're all a big part of the (in my eyes at least) great success of DreamLeague during the seasons. Thank you too.

I'm now moving on with other projects, and leaving DreamLeague feels a bit weird. But just like Ricky told Bubbles in TPB after he resisted to let go of that Puma (which they fed with weed if I remember right); If you love something, set it free. Thats kind of what Im doing now after nurturing DreamLeague with memes (better than drugs yall).

I hope you enjoy this season to the fullest and that you're ready for some Stranger Memes (which goes with our new video design if you've seen it). 

Thanks for watching, and keep on doing so!

Games on China servers are what dota 2 should be like.|self.DotA2|~So im really Only here to show appreciation to any of you Chinese redditors. I've recently moved to China, and playing on Chinese servers is a blessing. Random draft is amazing! Good on you guys, for keeping it alive! 

 I'm 4.5k and when I first started playing in China I lost a lot, I found myself not being on the same level as people here. They had incredible team play. They always tp counter gank, Always work together to secure objectives and very few players play selfish.  In my last three months of Dota, I can count with my fingers how many griefers I encountered. And every time I report someone action is always taken. 

 I barely speak Chinese, I have basic understanding though and can figure out what the team is doing, and it really hasn't slowed my team down the slightest. Regardless of language barriers, dota is still dota, and people in the same mmr usually have similar instincts. 

The greatest thing about games here Is, nobody flames, nobody blames you for making a mistake and rarely do teams harm each other by stealing farm or fighting over courier.  So you don't feel under pressure, and best of all you get this feeling, a very special feel that you have 4 allies. It's like back in the US id always feel like I'm about to join a game with 9 enimes, 4 of which who have a shared goal with me so we work together only because we want that +25. However over here in China I feel like these guys are actually my allies, people you can trust and even fall in love with for that 40 minute game. 

I know this is a blog post, but truly thank you very much China, for allowing me to experience Dota in an incredible way. I hope we can learn from them. Let's start with the man in the mirror.~|personal

I am retiring from Esports after six years|self.DotA2|~Most of the folks here are unfamiliar with me but a decent amount should be familiar with the site GosuGamers.net which is an Esports portal, covering games with news, match tickers, betting and database. I am currently operations manager there and the database (specifically for DotA/Dota 2) has been my passion for six years. Earlier this year I decided to retire from Esports due to various of reasons (going back to university, bad personal habits, depression, change of scenery and so on) and this upcoming week will be my last charted time at GosuGamers and within Esports. I hope you have enjoyed the work I have done and the things I have been building at GosuGamers and the work they will continue to do after my departure.  
  
I started out volunteering because I loved Dota and I loved the feeling of making others happy by providing coverage of the competitive scene. Later that passion turned into a full time paid job within Esports. So to everyone out there who wants to work within Esports; go for it. You will probably have to spend a bit of time first at low pay (or no pay at all) to prove yourself, make people reliant on you and such. After that you might get offered salary or at least have build merits to prove you're valuable in Esports.
  
Not going to lie, it's a lot of hard work. My time volunteering was like a part-time job counting the time I spent and the responsibilities I had. Worth noting is that mostly I took on responsibilities myself, when something we did was unsmooth or wrong, I would feel terrible and would have a hard time sleeping afterwards. I'd feel like I had failed myself and the community, even if it was just some "whatever"-scenario. As it became a full time job, there were almost not a single month where I didn't spend over 200 hours working. This was because I wanted to prove my worth and also because I had a hard time letting things go unattended. But at the end of the day, it was my choice and my passion.  
  
Esports is growing so much, it'll be amazing to see what the next year is like, with the majors and all the change they bring. And for the first time, I will now be following it as purely as fan.
  
---  

Over these six years I have;

* been responsible for Dota/Dota 2/general match ticker and database at GosuGamers since 2009, my ambition was always to provide users with an updated and accurate database. Some minor detail being wrong could bug me for days so in the end I had to fix it. Hardest part was to track Chinese tier 2-3 players and their frequently changed nicknames.

* been head admin for Dota 2 at Dreamhack Winter 2011, Dreamhack Summer 2012 and Dreamhack Winter 2012

* covered numerous of matches, "gosubets" and teams at GosuGamers. Added numerous of replays and VODs.

* published over 500 article pieces as well as close to 100 event coverage hubs (along with updating them)

* attended TI2, TI3 and TI4 for live coverage. Did some interviews at TI3 due lack of an interviewer. In general I'm not an on-camera or interviewer personality at all but I remember [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Tj0baTFXV4) with Alliance.s4 going quite well, I had to wing every single question as I was expecting an interview with Loda and Akke and the questions I had prepared were very specific.  

* been involved in the running of various online events, such as GosuLeague (five seasons in 2012), Corsair Gaming Summer Tour (2013), various GosuCups (2012-2014), Awesome Cup (Awesomenauts), Enter the Storm (Heroes of the Storm)

* for those who remember GarenaTV and WaaaghTV (it's a bit like DotaTV today and is what was used in Dota1, there were no livestreams, people only watched it this way or downloaded the replay afterwards), I streamed heaps of matches there on both platforms, for events such as GosuCup, MYM Prime Defending, CM Storm, Razer Global Challenge, Dota League, Balkan League and plenty I don't even remember the name of anymore.

Played with a new player today. Felt damn guilty|self.DotA2|~I started working a month ago so I don't really have time for some rank games. If I have some time, I would play Turbo matches instead. It's very fun btw but that's another topic. 


I queued SEA server, teammate picked normal heroes. Our first pick magnus wanted the mid lane so fine, no big deal. It's just Turbo game anyway. I picked storm and laned with a Huskar in top lane. 


Me and Huskar were against void and sniper. Huskar max third skill. Seemed pretty normal build. However whenever sniper or void hit him, first thing he did was running away. He would have 10% hp, pretty much guaranteed he's dead and still he chose to run away. I was pretty sure he would have killed them both if he stood there and right click. He proceeded to die 4 times in 10 minutes. 


I then triggered my inner keyboard warrior, I flamed him. "wtf you max third skill why did you run?!?!", "damn noob" and so on. He never said anything. He was quiet the whole game. Once in a while, he would use the in-game phrase like Push now. Get Back!


15 minutes in. Since it's a turbo game, the game is pretty much decided at this point and my team was winning anyway. Out of curiousity, I clicked his dota profile. 


- Profile Level 8. 
- GPM 233
- XPM 254. 


First thing came to my mind, shit he's a new player? Then I opened his steam profile. 


- Dota 2 is the only game, with 71 hours played. 
- He played 5.2 hours the past 2 weeks. 
- He has 3 friends in the friends list. 


I don't know whether he's a smurf or legit new player. From the game we played together, he's clearly someone that didn't know what he's doing. He bought Desolator as huskar. He was going to buy Satanic and had already bought Morbid Mask and Reaver. The thing is, he has 2 mangoes in his inventory so both his Morbid Mask and Reaver are in the backpack. He didn't know what is backpack.  I tried to teach him to swap the items and mangoes by dragging the items. He stood there for few seconds, probably trying to do so. But he didn't manage to put the Morbid Mask and Reaver back to the inventory. The game ended right there. 

Sorry for the long message. I felt so damn bad for him also guilty for what I have done to him in the beginning. I commended him, told him I'm sorry in steam message. I also sent him a drow set with the message "This hero is easier to start off with". I went back to his steam profile and saw he's offline already. 


Seriously, fuck me man. It's only monday and I'm treating people like shit already. Sorry huskar and sorry to all the new players that just joined this game. Heck, it doesnt matter whether they are new players or not, I should probably use my brain more often and treat people nicely. Sorry for the long message. ~|personal
My thoughts on DotA, addiction, and personal life|self.DotA2|~There is a vice to every fascination and an Achille's heel to every joy. 

Take note of this [demographics survey](http://imgur.com/a/gpfME) by /u/electricf0x. I'm a 23 year old male currently in college which is very similar to most of you and these are my thoughts:

DotA 2 is a wonderfully complex game that appeals to my competitive nature, love of fantasy and action, and respect of a well designed game.  Quite simply, I love this game, and perhaps a bit too much.

This is an odd thing to say, but for some reason boredom can be a wonderful thing.  I don't like going out to social events to meet new people; yet when I am bored I tend to do that.  I don't like studying for my college classes; yet when I am bored and motivated I do that.

DotA has the ability to remove any boredom or want for adventure or something different.  The game is too enjoyable, and that scares me.  

When I play this game, I don't care about my girlfriend, I don't care about meeting my parents, I don't care about going outside to go hiking or floating or drinking with friends; I simply want to play this game.  That sounds a lot like a drinking or drug addiction which does not help you in the adventure of life.

Whether its a game, or drugs, or drinking, or travelling, its good to keep in mind if your current fascination is a benefit or detriment to how you are living your life.  Some of us have been there: you wake up and play this game for 8 to 13 hours until you go to bed while ignoring all texts, calls, and other opportunities while your grades, social relations, and fitness suffers.

I want to be a person who is well versed in all aspects of life rather than just one hobby.  If DotA is affecting your academic or personal life, do take a break and focus on other areas of your life.  The focus of life shouldn't be around one game.  So just keep in mind that there's more to how you are living than just this game, and if you feel addicted to it to the point where you can't give attention to anything else that is good for you it is a good idea to temporarily uninstall the game and find joys in other parts of life. ~|personal
I think the Compendium Battle Bonus needs to remain|self.DotA2|~Until all the stretch goals have been actually released to the purchasers.

5. A-Z Challenge Support
6. New Music.

So quite a few things, I think that we should keep the bonus until those items and such are released.  ~|personal esports

Ever been harassed in a game of Dota? These guys have reached new levels of assholery|self.DotA2|~[Was just told about this group of people by a guy who played with one of them.](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/KILLSELFPLS)


In his words:
"A guy on my team just now added me to tell me to go kill myself. Which is actually pretty typical of the average Dota player, but this fucker goes a step further. He has a Steam group where he digs up and posts the names and the Facebook pages of people who somehow wronged him in Defense Against the Ancients 2. Does Valve just kind of go along with this level of harassment and general toxic behavior?"

Both me and him have reported the group and the people who are posting this stuff, but this just goes above and beyond other stuff I've seen from some people. Is there anything else that can be done about these guys other than just sit around and hope Valve decides to actually do something about this?

**edit:** just got home, saw this really blew up. Nice to see that all those groups those guys had up that did similar stuff got taken down. Good job valve but it really shouldn't take a reddit post to bring your attention to things like this. Good job Reddit and thanks for front page!~|personal

Hey r/dota2, a man needs your help for his undergraduate dissertation.|self.DotA2|~Let me introduce myself first. I'm a 21 y/o college student from Uruguay doing a major in Communication and specialized in advertising and branding. I study at Universidad de la Repblica and I've just entered the final year of my college career, which means I have to propose for an undergraduate dissertation on my area of interest to conduct research through the year. 

As a Dota and esports fan overall, one topic that I'd like to research is *advertisement and sponsorships in the world of esports, and how that works for all the different actors involved*.
Now, that comes with a couple of difficulties for me. First, I need to gather sources of information and second, I need to convince the head of the research department that the topic is worth investigating. The latter is completely up to me, but the former is the reason I came here for. Here in Uruguay there is no pro scene, so I have no representatives from organizations I can go to in order to get some info.

Now we all know r/dota2 is a place that players, organizations, tournament organizers and other actors frequently visit so what I want to ask from you is to help me get **visibility** so that they can see my case and, if they are willing to help, communicate with me. In order to make a good case on why this matters as a subject of research, I'm gonna need to prove that I can gather good sources of information, and as many as possible.
So please, help a man raise awareness of esports and maybe even help to the development of the industry if the research comes through. 

*TL;DR* I'm trying to conduct research on advertisement and sponsorships in esports but I need to contact players, orgs, representatives, please help make this visible.  

**EDIT** Wow, this got big faster than I expected. Thanks guys! I will get in contact with the people you've suggested, altough I'll wait till major is over so people are not so busy and I don't bother them. Really appreciate your help! You guys are great.~|personal

League player plays Dota 2|self.DotA2|~Hello Redditors of Dota2. I'm a top 5% player in LoL and have recently decided to give Dota2 a try with my brother. I would like to think that I am unbiased and came in with a very open mind.

After downloading the game. My brother and I quickly completed the first part of the tutorial which was essentially telling you how to move and take towers which is very simple considering our previous moba experience. We then decided to move to some bot games to learn the game. The queue was 15 minutes which is very long compared to LoL bot games which has very short queue times. A quick google showed the essentially no one in Dota plays bot games, so we switched to normal games.

Very first game, we got the shit out flamed out of us for taking heroes into wrong lane and doing things I apparently shouldn't be doing or not doing things I should be doing. Thankfully after thousands of hours of toxicity from LoL, we were able the laugh if off. After playing for over 15 hours now, I would like to share my thoughts and provide some meaningful discussion about Dota compared to LoL.

The graphics of dota is much more dark and less cheesy characters. I prefer Dota graphics over League however I've played Runescape over 10 years, graphics to me is so insignificant compared to game play.

Dota 2 has many more mechanics compared to league. The tutorial barely touches the sea of information you get once you load into a real game. I was very overwhelmed with the new concepts - including secret shops, couriers and trees. I don't hate new mechanics which some of my friends have voiced their opinions to me about. "Why does this stupid game have turn rates" To me this screams of ignorance, different games different mechanics you have to learn it. I didn't even try to deny in my very first game and as I played more and got used to things I could start focusing on the smaller intricacies.

I love the fact you don't have to grind over 30 hours to own one hero and everything impacting the actual gameplay is unlocked from the beginning. (Aside from the fact you can only play 20 heroes in your first 25 games). This to me is one of lols worst things. Therefore having the opposite makes this one of the best things for dota for me.

Matchmaking is god awful, every time I finish a game and I view someones profile they have more wins than me and my brother multiplied by 25. I don't understand how this happens when I'm level 1 I should be playing with level 1's. It's different if you're smurfing and you stomp me, but when I clearly see you are way higher level than me and dota clearly knows level 1 + level 1 <<<<<<<< level 50 + level 50. It was off putting. Can't imagine a completely new MOBA player starting his first dota game.

No one is helpful. The amount of times me and my brother ask beginner questions only to be replied with the words "gg noob team". It's staggering. We learn fast but the toxicity can really put new players off. Distinctly remember first game, TOXIC GUY : "Buy smokes" ME : "What are smokes?" TOXIC GUY : "Are you fking srs?" ME : "Yes" TOXIC GUY TO ALLCHAT "OMFG idiot Sniper pls report" Thank god for this other toxic game I played for many hours and have thickened my skin.

To me multiplayer games don't have a difficulty factor. This is why in multiplayer games you don't pick a mode at the start of each game, "Novice, Normal, Hard, Extreme". The difficulty of the game depends of the opponents. You face the best players the game is difficult beyond belief. You face the worst players the game is easier than tic tac toe.

A proportion of players think that complexity adds to difficulty. Which I believe to be false. Think of a game like chess, the rules are simple yet the skill cap is infinite. Now some people may have heard of a variation of chess, "Crazyhouse", where a player can introduce a captured piece back to the chessboard as his own. A more complex "chess", but a better "chess". Debatable.

In my quest to learn Dota I watched a video where a master tier lol player (top 0.2%) plays Dota. Apparently he wasn't very good. The comment section had some quite pitiful remarks. "Master in lol = 1k mmr in dota", "dota player plays lol carries, lol player plays dota feeds". Drawing again on my chess analogy. Crazyhouse is harder to play than normal chess it has more mechanics just like dota has more mechanics than league. Of course when you remove mechanics and have less to worry about you can transition better than adding mechanics in which you have to learn.

I like Dota. I like lol. I don't understand why the two communities are at each other throats all the time. If you play a game you don't have to hate the games competitors, especially as a gamer where you can play both without any repercussions. You're not the gaming company you're not in direct competition with each other, they don't take your profits.

My thoughts are all over the place, I just wanted to get them down and start a discussion. Sorry for writing a very disjointed post.

Clinkz is the best motivational speaker.|self.DotA2|~Whenever I feel like not doing something or being generally procrastinative, I think to myself "Better to run than to curse the road." and I suddenly go "fuck yeah better to run than to fucking curse" and start doing stuff.

I made a website that automatically generates highlights using data from twitch chat. What do you guys think?|self.DotA2|~http://skip2.tv

**Here's how it works:** Click on a broadcast to load up the VoD. Click on the red and blue bars to scrub the video.

Each bar represents 15 seconds of chat data, and a click will take you to the point in the VoD when those messages were sent, minus 30 seconds. Usually this puts you right about where the highlight begins, but not always. For cases like these, there's a 10s rewind button.

The idea here is being able to watch long VoDs in a short amount of time.

------------------------------------------------------------

There are still a lot of aspects about the website that need improving, and I'll be making changes to it every couple of days. But I think it's time that I opened it up to the community and made this a collaborative process. Any feedback you might have is welcome and appreciated.

In any case, I hope skip2 proves to be super useful for everyone trying it out. I'll be here answering questions in the comments below. ~|personal
I play DotA2 since 6 months, and god why did I wait so long ?|self.DotA2|~So.
I'm currently 31 years old, and I've played A LOT of videogames since I'm 5.
FPS, MMO, Strategy, RPG, Indies... Everything was good for me.

The only type of game I didn't tried was the Moba.
I wasn't interested in it, how can we be ? Always the same map, always the same strategies, the same heroes, etc...
I know what you think " god what a fool ". And you will be right !

My brother-in-law spoke to me about DotA for 5 years, since the release, always trying to enroll me.

In the end, I said yes, just to confirm to myself than it was lame.

I
WAS
WRONG


Since 6 months, I've played more than 200 hours. I like this game A LOT. Even if it his very very very VERY ( add more if you want ) hard for a noob.

I've never played any Moba before, so the learning curve was... like this :

 - " Don't go that way , you will be killed. See, told ya !"
 - " Why didn't you go that way ? You may have survived ! NOOO NOT THIS W... You're dead." 
 - " USE YOUR FUCKING STICK ! USE YOUR FU... You're dead."
 - " Why did you go so close to him ? Hopefully I've saved you and... Oh, you're dead."
 - " Please put some wards. Not there. Not there either. There is useless. Don't go th... You're dead, goodbye"
 - " Now it's time for your ult... Oh, you're dead"


I play mainly CM and support roles, and I like it a lot. I see than in every game I play, I become better and better, I learn stuff everyday about other heroes and theirs capacities.
I was told than I must know all the heroes and all theirs spells. Oh, and all the items. 
It's true. It's damn true. I didn't fully understand the game was so difficult and deep. You must play it to understand.


So there is no main goal in this post, just some things I wanted to write, and some advices I thought of :

 - Find people to play with you, alone it's very difficult to understand the game.
 - There is no stupid questions, only stupid anwsers.
 - Wards.
 - check your settings, there is a lot of nice things you can turn on.
 - Sentry.
 - Even if the game is about to be lost, try harder. Try things, try objects and new technics.
 - More wards & sentries.

And I also want to thanks my "teachers" who gave me the opportunity to learn at my pace this wonderful game, and their patience with my stupid noob mistakes.



And you . Why did you start ? Was it hard, too ?

EDIT : Wow I didn't think it will generate "so much" comments :D Nice to see that the community can have nice conversations sometimes haha

Update from zoomed in guy|self.DotA2|~In case youve never heard of me, I played my first 900 hours fully zoomed in.
Throughout the past year, my friends have shown me several references to the original post about me.
[Heres the original 
post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3a8179/for_905_hours_my_friend_has_played_fully_zoomed/). I thought it was about time to share how Im doing now.

Back when I played zoomed in, I calibrated at 1.7k mmr. After getting a new mouse and realizing you could zoom out, I asked my friends if it had always been this way. They told me it could only be done in spectator mode. However, after a few more minutes of questioning, we realized that I had been playing fully zoomed in for 900 hours.

This enlightenment began my climb to 5k (lol). That summer I climbed to 2.4k and fell back to 2.1k. I stopped playing ranked for a while because of school and not enjoying solo queues. However, this summer the International Battle Pass was announced. When I heard that you could receive a new mmr and replace your original with it, I immediately purchased the battle pass. I played my first 10 solo games and calibrated at 2.5k, only 400 higher than my actual solo. Playing the required 40 games was a nightmare, and I legitimately ran out of reports three times. After playing all 40 games, I ended up at mid 2.6k. Although this mmr might not seem very high to all of you 9k redditors, its a big step forward for me. Climbing almost 1000 mmr from where I started was not easy, and seeing this progress motivates me to climb even higher.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them and Ill do my best to answer them.
To anyone else trying to raise their 1 or 2k solo, stay strong and keep climbing!

Dota has taught me how to be a man|self.DotA2|~What are the most important lessons a father can teach his son? Being a man isn't about muscles and beer, instead it's very similar to a set of values. Dota, rather than my actual father, has put more hair on my chest than any amount of whiskey I've ever consumed.

1. Patience
It doesn't matter if your support feeds because your offlane is constantly flaming him for not buying enough wards, or if your team picks offlane medusa into an antimage. What matters is that you look at their decisions with calmness and poise. After winning numerous games from refraining to flame and instead being the patient friend who slowly suggests the right path.

2. Strength
Strength isn't picking sf mid everygame regardless of any outside circumstances. It's having the courage to adjust to your team's needs. Someone pick lc jungle AND you have a safelane luna? You know there isn't enough farm on the map for your preferred hero, so pick something safer. 

3. Lovemaking
I never recieved the "birds and the bees" talk from my father. Instead at 3am on a US west server I encountered a nice canadian man who picked techies. He narrated his entire journey and, while the rest of my team muted him, I continued to listen. He told me that pleasing a woman is very similar to playing techies. You must know exactly how many mines to place, not too much not too little. You must know WHERE to put the mines (he placed a lot of emphasis on this). The most important thing he said what that it isnt all about placing the mines, its about looking at your game and seeing how best to change your gameplay to suit that game in particular, since every game is different and beautiful in her own way.

TL;DR - im not drinking enough alcohol~|personal
With all this hype about Techies, I just found out I was the one who gave them their apparently awesome third name 8 years ago. Story time!|self.DotA2|~I don't really know how to prove this as this was a long time ago. 8 years ago, when I used to play DotA Allstars on Warcraft 3 in my high school years, I posted a suggestion on the forums about giving Techies a third name ([archived forum post here](http://da-archive.com/index.php?showtopic=77704)). Unfortunately the archived forum doesn't show the screenshots, but basically I pointed out the third goblin.

Back then, Techies were named "Squee and Spleen". However, the unit model actually had three goblins - the [third one was literally a barrel with two legs running underneath it](http://www.terrariaonline.com/attachments/goblin-sappers-png.8711/), in obvious comedic fashion. Three goblins were even acknowledged in the hero's description/lore, but why was there no name? Thus, my juvenile self decided to post up a suggestion.

I suggested a list of names, and "Spoon" became the most popular choice. I pointed this out and waited for "Squee, Spleen, and Spoon" to become a reality.

Fast forward 2.5 years later (2008)...At this point I had stopped playing WC3/DotA for years and was completely unaware my suggestion was finally implemented in [version 6.58](http://www.playdota.com/changelogs/6.58). Notice in the changelog, the numbers listed in parenthesis matches the url of my forum post.

Fast forward again almost exactly 8 years later (I actually posted that suggestion July 19 2006! Dang!). By now I have graduated from university. The imminent release of Techies for DotA 2, and realizing that they had a third name, made me ponder if I was responsible for giving them their full name. A little bit of research allowed me to find out I was a part of DotA history after all! Even better, in one of the Techies dialogue/responses, they actually poke a little fun at this:
["They call me Squee!" "They call me Spleen!" "They don't know I'm here." "Who said that?"](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/d/df/Tech_spawn_06.mp3)

~~~~The funny thing is I don't like Techies that much - I think their design just doesn't fit into DotA and they're kind of toxic rather than enjoyable/adding to gameplay (Pain in the arse for new players, easily counterable for experienced players, completely defensive based style leads to annoyingly massive turtling and extending match length).~~~~ Actually since it's been a very long time since I've seen Techies in action in DotA, my opinion is pretty outdated as the game has changed massively over 8 years. I still enjoyed playing them back in high school though. Regardless, it's absolutely amazing DotA is still living on throughout all these years. Heck, I wouldn't have believed an almost $11 million dollar tournament could even happen with this game (I suppose no one did...truly amazing stuff).

So not that exciting, but still cool to me nonetheless. Do you have an interesting story of how you made a suggestion that was actually implemented? 

**TL,DR:** Almost exactly 8 years (2006) ago [I suggested giving Techies a third name since there's 3 of them](http://da-archive.com/index.php?showtopic=77704). It took the DotA Allstars staff 2.5 years later (2008) to implement this in [version 6.58](http://www.playdota.com/changelogs/6.58). In 2014 I decide to look into my past and found out my suggestion actually did get in and that I'm a part of DotA history, woot woot.~|personal
Anyone else love this game but hate playing it?|self.DotA2|I love the complexities and awesome strategies to this game, but every time I play it I start realizing I don't really like playing it all that much.

EE and Machine - a study in heartbreak and compassion|self.DotA2|~I always have a tough time watching losers interviews, especially at highstakes tourneys like TI - and especially with emotional people like Jacky. 
But while this interview was short, it might have been my favorite that I've ever seen. And here's why:

1) Machine begins with a sincere acknowledgement that he's got a shitty job to do right now. He doesn't shy away from the fact that asking, "what's going through your mind" is cliched. I really believe that you get what you give, and Machine sorta lowering his guard and recognizing the difficulty of the situation helped bring out the most heartfelt response from Envy. Speaking of which -

2) Envy's response. Jesus. One thing that made it incredible imo was that it was clear that he never prepared a statement for this scenario - his singleminded goal is winning every Dota2 game plays. It says fuckton about the type of person that he is. And the response that he DID make in the moment was bracingly honest - getting kicked out of TI is always a career changing moment for a player; as he meandered between his career now, his past accomplishments, and his future with his team, you could almost understand what it feels like to have your whole professional life flash in front of your eyes. I don't know if many of us will ever have an experience as dramatic as that - and especially not live, in front of an audience of thousands. 
And with all that happening, "I'm not going to quit" was his first (and INSTANT) reaction. No matter what you think of his play, the man is an inspiration. 

3) This may be a less significant thing, but amidst everything, the interactions between EE, Machine, and the audience really stood out to me. When the cheers came out as EE announced that he wasn't going to quit, it was a really touching moment, and I'm glad Machine acknowledged it as well. There's no doubt that Envy is a supremely self-motivated person; much of his career has been proving people that didn't believe in him wrong through his own isolated hard work. To see the fans come through especially in a low moment - I'm sure it meant a lot. Just because you're good at struggling alone doesn't mean you don't need love. I hope he gets to hear those cheers as often as he needs - and hopefully under more happy circumstances.

I might be over analyzing this guys, but it's just my effort at picking apart why this moment hit me so hard. Good luck Envy. We've got your back.

From a New Player -|self.DotA2|~>Before I start off this post, from the bottom of my heart I really want to thank all of you. I know this sub has it's ups and downs, but thank you all for helping my get my footing in this wonderful game.


Last month was not the best for me. I found out that my job was closing down. My son was sick and in the hospital with pneumonia. My wife and I were so stressed that she left the house to stay with her parents so we both could have some alone time from each other and re-center of sorts. I had never felt so alone in my entire life. I felt like everything was crumbling around me and all I could do was watch it happen. I decided to hop on to Reddit for a bit of a distraction, and wound up here. I'd played DOTA a little bit when it came out while I was stationed in Korea, but not a whole lot since then up until a couple weeks ago. I started looking through some of the posts on here, and decided to redownload the game. Hopping into a few bot matches to relearn the game and grab my favorite character (Slark). I decided to pour through the new player posts as well to get as much information as possible so that I could really grasp the game, and it's given me such a great escape for me right now. There was a point in time after I redownloaded the game, all I did was come home and hop into bot matches and play to get over all of the bullshit that was going on around me. I had recently quit drinking, and I'm glad that DOTA grabbed me before the bottle could again, which was pretty tempting considering everything else that was going on. 

So, thank all of you for taking the time to help new players and returning old players alike with this game. It really means the world to me that you guys are such a great community. Sure, like any community we have our ups and downs, but thank you all very much for being great players. I might still be terrible, but DOTA 2 has given me an escape for my PTSD, and an escape for when my world was crumbling and giving me something else to focus on. It means the world to me, and I'm sure the other new players in the sub as well. 

Now, a couple of weeks later and I am happy to say that I have found a new job, my son and wife are back home and everything is getting patched up nicely. 

Thank you guys so much for being a great community, and I look forward to playing some of you guys when I finally make that leap into online PVP instead of the kiddie pool with bots!~|personal

Guys, I need help.|self.DotA2|~So here is when it all started and how it started. On August 12, after Liquid won the Internationals, there was a huge surge of people from China/Sea flooding the Toronto Public channel. I don't know why, probably to get NA perspective/reaction. They were literally spamming the chat in Chinese. I told them to stop spamming the channel. Next thing I know is I get this notification - "No one hears you. Your account has been flagged as disruptive and your public chat privileges temporarily revoked." I got mass reported by Mainland China. As you can tell, there's no timer, I assumed it was a bug, my public chat privileges would come back after a week. It is currently August 23, well over one week. I noticed something was wrong. I decided to investigate and stumbled on this thread http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=282806 -. 
Following the instructions, the Epoch Converter revealed when my "temporary public chat ban" would be lifted: Monday, 11 December 2017 01:26:34. My eyes almost popped out of my eye socket.

TLDR: **I've been banned from public channel for five months.** because all of China reported me in a North America public channel. Currently I opened a steam ticket, but please, keep me in your prayers and donate me an upboat so Volvo can send halp. Please mr /u/DanielJ_Valve  /u/JeffHill Valve I need halp.


Update: Steam Support said they can't even remove it. GG

Who else is depressed and plays this game constantly because of it?|self.DotA2|~Sorry if this is a shit post but just wanted to know if other people play this game an exorbitant amount since people in real life all reject you.

Dota 2 Health PSA|self.DotA2|~I don't know where this will end up, but I feel the need to say it.

I'm nearly 26.  After about a decade in the military (most of which was sitting down on planes or flying a desk), and the constant draw of playing video games, I found myself having quite a bit of a pain in my ass.  Literally!  I went to the doc, and they said: "Well, let's do some PT."  A few months later, I'm still in (worse) pain, and it turns out I have a bulged disc in my back.    

Many injections later, and a lot of physical therapy, I'm back to relatively normal life, but there are some things I can't really ever do again.  I'm paying to get my stuff moved into our new house, instead of moving it myself, because I don't want to risk another month of excruciating pain.  That's money that could be spent on better things.

Why am I telling you this?  

One of the main reasons, I think, that this happened to me, is because I spent a lot of time sitting.  Granted, much of that was part of my job, but a lot of it had to do with being such a regular PC gamer, and not sitting in a good position even after work was over.  I was in pretty decent shape, being a Marine and exercising regularly, but it was not enough.

So, as an old fart with a bad back, I just want to put this out there: **take care of yourself**.  Eat well.  Get off TS/Skype/Jabber/Jibber/Yahoo Messenger!/ICQ for a few minutes and stretch.  Tell your buddies you've got something you need to do before the next game, or recommend they do the same.  It's not good to sit there bent over the keyboard for hours on end.  

I know this all sounds obvious and a bit silly, but the fact of the matter is that we have a whole generation that is really into games.  Let's not end up with broken bodies because we were too stubborn to put the next round of *mid or feed* on hold for a few minutes of stretching.

I went to bed last night with the same old pain I have at the end of every day; despite taking far better care of my back now, I'll have this pain forever.  I fell asleep thinking of anti-gravity chairs that let you play Dota for as long as you like and never incur injuries that creep up on you like this one.  I'm not smart enough to invent that, so I'm making this post.

**TL;DR** Remember to take a break when you're playing Dota, eat well, stretch, and don't let the game run your health into the ground.

**Edit 1**: Wow, I did not imagine this would get so much attention!  I am very thankful that the post has brought this subject to the forefront for many of you.  I am also very appreciative of the gold, so thank you for that as well!~|personal
Fuck you Chinese Dota: To the Shameless Pro Players|self.DotA2|~This is a translation of [the post by  on SGamer](http://bbs.sgamer.com/thread-12870339-1-2.html), posted after the elimination of the Chinese teams in [the Shanghai Major](http://liquipedia.net/dota2/Shanghai_Major/2016).

The post is now under spotlight again following the defeats of three Chinese teams in the DAC breakout round. I thought it would be interesting to share the perspectives of the hardcore Chinese fans here.

"**This is not funny at all.**" -- EHOME.GIGABYTE.820.CN

---

**Day 1**

LGD called GG against MVP in 20 mins.

This is what Zou Yitian said while watching a Dagon Invoker and a triple Vitality Booster Io.

820 was the captain of the legendary EHOME lineup that won 10 championships, including the first Dota championship in 2007.

To be honest, it was not a surprise that [Newbee](https://i.imgur.com/6D32mPS.png) lost.

The aging Chinese General Hao, wasn't even good at last hitting with Spectre, his signature hero.

The Immortal God Mu, who played RPG all night long, was making terrible decisions left and right that led to the crushing defeat.

All the other teams, were at best tier 2.

**Day 2**

**I am fucking asking, are you worthy of anything?**

[This](https://i.imgur.com/eJB6XFj.png) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/kKhO40L.jpg) was the venue after the elimination of both LGD and EHOME. Almost 10 pm at night, the audience congregated near the casters to get closer to the stage. No early eviction from the venue today, and everyone staying wanted Newbee to win: the majority had already left after the shameful defeat of these two teams. Despite that, the crowd that remains was cheering for Newbee when they stepped onto the stage. But **are you worthy of these fans**?

LGD, you four, **are you worthy of Sylar's form**? Invisible supports, talentless mid, Batrider that got himself initiated on. Do you know you are playing in a tournament? Facing the Complexity that got dumpstered by EG every single time? Sorry I've forgotten, that you've never won against EG in elimination matches. That said, as a team that slept until 9:05, how could you even be worthy of a victory over coL, who woke up early went to the opening ceremony?

When the MVP players woke up to play ranked games at 6 am, you have just gone to sleep. Right? Chinese teams?

While the MVP players were playing solo ranked, you were playing and laughing with your girlfriends. Right? Chinese teams?

With what you are gonna win? With an attitude like this?  

Of all the teams, only \[A\] [did the signing session for the fans](https://i.imgur.com/ZudBRJq.png), that's the attitude of Loda.

Asking (the fans) whether he was performing well as a carry, that's also the attitude of Loda.

What in the world are you even practising?

Strategies that can't even win in pub games, strategies that make your [carry player play an offlane hero](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2193658590)?

EHOME, the ugly performance put on with your Ember during the Radiant Dire Cup. How confident you are!

Pro players who dare not play in high MMR games. Closing your door and building a cart at home is the name of Chinese Dota.

Once known for the strongest mechanical skills, what now?  
Miss your CS,  
Lose your lane,  
Game over in 20 mins!

[These](https://i.imgur.com/Ev3mddH.jpg) were the boards that I brought to the venue. I held them up for around 20 minutes. Wasn't in a good position to be captured by the live camera. Only a camera guy and a couple random people took pictures of them.

**Chinese Dota, you aren't even ashamed of yourself.**

After the elimination of LGD, I thought about moving behind the casters (to be captured and streamed). There a VP fan was holding a VP sign. Not wanting to disturb him, I decided to stay where I was.

Now that I've thought about it again, I gave you, you trash pros face by not doing this.

[This](https://i.imgur.com/hCQhkP2.png) is when Newbee called GG, after stubbornly fighting into Sven at his peak.

A girl, wearing a Newbee jersey, was crying.  
Countless fans, with accents from all over the country, were sighing.  
And someone, on the zebra crossing just outside of the Mercedez-Benz Arena, said,

# Trash.

[0] When Cty was criticized by some fans, he asked "did I give you face?", meaning whether he has permitted them to criticize.

[1] When asked by a fan why EHOME didn't go to the opening ceremony and that whether their professionalism had been fed to the dogs, Cty replied "was it delicious?".

[2] When a fan left a comment under ChuaN's weibo for him to practise more heroes, "I'll practise [with] your mom" was the reply from ChuaN.

Real life tragedy can happen at any time, even during Dota|self.DotA2|~Last night before bed I usually play a couple of matches of ranked and every once in a while I have a few groups of guys on my friends list that invite me on discord to play if they need to have an open spot filled. I dont know them in real life but we laugh, communicate and usually have a solid time whenever they need me to play instead of their main friends.

In the middle of the match one of our teammates said he would be right back so the constant pausing by us and unpausing by the other team ensues with the typical trash talk that we all have grown accustomed too when a pause drags on. His absence grew to a weird amount and we became quite anxious as our lead started to slip away. 

He returned to his mic as a barrage of allegations were sent at him as to for why he was gone for so long and why he asked us if one of us could take over his hero disruptive. He then answered in a sullen voice that his wife had a miscarriage and he couldnt continue the match.

To hear of such a horrific tragedy from someone  in real time that Ive never known personally really struck my heart and reminded me that even though video games are  escapism for many users, real life can come at you at any moment. I feel terrible for this person Ive only known as a steam username and I hope his wife and family will be able to recover from the loss of a child. I hope this story will motivate everyone to treat people in Dota a lil bit better since you have no idea what they are going through or what can happen to them in a moments notice.

Edit:
Hey its great to see people being able to open up about hard topics that have happened in their lives.  As a community that is interested in dota its only right that we can care and show support for people we know and strangers online if something happens big or small.~|personal

Valve, will you please open your eyes to the relation between losing monthly active players and the performance issues?|self.DotA2|~It's pretty clear to me, after some topics here on this subreddit, that one of the major reasons behind Dota 2's number of players been decreasing is the recent performance issues and the frustration of the players for not having the same FPS they had before.


I'll take my country as an example: Brazil is a shit country and he wave very little money to buy eletronics, they're really expensive related to some average income of the population. Eletronics here have really huge taxes and stuff like that... It's kinda rare when a person actually have money to play on 5-core 3.3GHz processor with the latest dedicated video card... most people actually don't have money to own a desktop AND a laptop so they go just for the laptop instead.


I would say that out of 100 people that play games, here in Brazil we have **at least** 60 playing League, and like 10 playing dota, TOPS. And what's really interesting behind this approximated number is that League can run on a steady 60fps, without drops on team fights, all options to medium, on a i3-6100u laptop (as confirmed by myself). While dota *barely* goes higher than 50, dire base is like 35 and team fights i have 25 or something and it's impossible to actually click and stun a weaver with her new shukuchi movespeed talent.

I can guarantee, at least in my country, that performance is a major reason why people pick valve's number 1 rival instead of Dota 2. **EVERY** laptop can run League, not every laptop can run dota 2 and the higher you go on the laptop specs, less people can play the game~|personal

So I bought the Winter 2017 BP yesterday (laugh all you want)|self.DotA2|~Hi guys,
Before you down vote me for being a mentally retarded f**, please hear me out.  I know that technically Winter ends in February, so I was worried about buying above pass, and I did a quick google search to be told that the next battle pass would be coming out in time for the TI7, meaning that I would have roughly 3 months to do all the good quests that are included in the BP.  Unfortunately, after buying it and activating it, I'm helpfully told that me pass has expired.  Three days before it was bought in fact.  To be quite honest, I find this unacceptable.  There was no indication on the store page that the pass had expired, or indeed any mention of when it was going to expire.  I contacted valve in order to get a refund, but apparently because I've activated it, I can't get a refund.
I don't know about in the US, but in the EU it is illegal for a supermarket to sell out of date products, and that is essentially what Valve is doing here, without any warning of such.

Nice one Valve.

If someone can help me out, tell me what I can do with an expired BP, and not laugh *to* hard.

Thanks,

EDIT: fixed formatting

EDIT 2: Big thanks to everyone who up voted this!  I managed to catch Valve's eye and get a full refund, so all is good.  Also, a big thanks to the Dota 2 team.  You guys rock!~|personal
SirActionSlacks owes me a Jugg set.|self.DotA2|~On December 13 of 2014, back in the days before SirActionSlacks was a some Big-shot host of dota, I decided to watch this pug filled stream with around 350 viewers. Low and behold, near the time that I got on, a giveaway was happening. SirActionSlacks said that his random name generator wasnt working, so instead he randomly picked a name from the list of viewers. Low and behold, I won! I was overjoyed - never did I win such things. 

&nbsp;


He said to message him, and he would give me the set. Of course, I did right away. I was quite ecstatic, as you can see in the [message](http://imgur.com/gallery/rrPdw). However, I recieved no reply. Disappointed, I gave him a few days to respond before trying again.

&nbsp;


On the 17th of December, I proceeded to send Mr. Slacks [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/2HkNq), in the hope this was all some misunderstanding. Again, no reply. I decided I was never receiving the Jugg set, and moved on with my life, albiet my hopes in the goodness of the world crushed. Never again did of think of that silly jugg set.

&nbsp;


That is, until I had the unique opportunity to attend The International in the year of 2016. There I saw the same man who never gave me the fairly won Jugg set bouncing around on stage, looked upon as a pillar of the community. Not only that, but he the team which he subbed for ended second place - his moment of triumph only made my moment worse.

&nbsp;


I returned home after said International, and after a few waning weeks of summer, I could stay silent no longer. I'm allowing the whole community to see the man for what he really is - A person who does not give out sets to people who improperly contacts him using the shitty twitch messaging system.

&nbsp;

EDIT: I don't want a jugg arcana, please don't give me one. Mr. Slacks, I quite appreciate the reply. For full disclosure, me winning the jugg set was something I felt quite guilty about. It was the first and last time I ever went on your stream, and the only reason I won was because when you said the random user thing doesnt work you decided to scroll down to the bottom of the viewer list and pick that person. I was at the bottom because I believe I may have been one of the most recent people to join the stream. Hence why I also didn't know any of the rules for how to get an item when you win - I didn't come to your stream to read I came for some 3k Dotes Kappa. Anyways you just said message me, so, not knowing Twitch messaging was absolute dog shit (The two messages I sent to you are the only two I have ever sent or received) I didn't know to message you anywhere else. I am just a lowly pleb with no knowledge of such things. I fixed my above post to better reflect the current situation.

&nbsp;

EDIT 2: I have an idea, if slacks is agreeable. I have no interest in any actual item or set at this point - Slacks recognition that I did indeed win was enough for me. I feel validated. However, Slacks if you would agree perhaps, to do another giveaway, and give away the item that was one day meant for me, I would be much appreciated. Glad we could both make sweet and non-aggressive ^^kappa posts to get to the best solution possible :D.~|personal

Want to surprise gf by quitting DotA, how hard is it?|self.DotA2|~*Actual edit*: Yo, I'm not quitting Dota, I thought this was pretty obviously a parody / shitpost of the other post about the gf wanting to start Dota for her bf. If anyone is actually finding it difficult to quit Dota, scroll to the bottom of the comments. There's a shit load of advice. I'm just a single dude that is happily playing some dotes.

_____

Hi,

Just a trashy pub player here with plenty of Dota 2 experience since before TI3 4 years ago. However, my gf is a regular person and hates DotA and so Im always sneaking twitch streams and ranked games from her.

I kinda want to try to quit playing so that I can surprise her as well as be more productive so that I can work a normal job and finish my degree. I just feel tentative to quit because I understand how normal human beings don't talk to each other in twitch memes and Im afraid that Ill be so awkward ( haHAA *cringe* haHAA ) people will hate me. It also looks like a fun time not playing Dota 2 all day so Id like to try but I know I will just reinstall it again so Im worried about that too.
Any advice?

Edit: Thank you for all your advice and input, I appreciate it so much! I will definitely give uninstalling Dota 2 a try and keep to regular social situations at first until I can stop talking like Arteezy (wE acUTALUY fCKHing LoST, gET ME OUUT). Then over time when I can talk to people confidently, Ill tell her and I think it would be a nice unexpected surprise. Its really way out of my comfort zone. My hobbys gaming and hers is makeup so I think shell have a good laugh.

Edit 2: Wow, I woke up to this which blew up more than I thought it would so thank you! Ill honestly give quitting a try from this post alone because the community has been much more open to the idea of me leaving Dota 2 forever than I thought. And to answer some of your questions, my gf doesnt reddit! So she wont see this post. See, were opposite in the way that Im on reddit when Im on the toilet and what she does is just take a shit, wipe her ass, and leave like people have been doing for millenia.~|personal

I believe in Alliance.|self.DotA2|~EHOME vs Alliance, for their next match. Ehome is unstoppable, most wins out of any team on either group. So many people believe this is the end for them, that Alliance is surely to fall into the lower bracket.

But I believe in Alliance.

My boys have been through too much after TI4. EGM leaving, S4 leaving, even the Dongmeister taking a break. The Swede Stack looked broken; but here they are, in their full might. Group stage was shaky; they were on the verge of being in lower bracket.

But I believed in Alliance.

And, as if to answer my prayer, they pulled off the craziest comeback in TI6 as of yet, and managed to secure Upper Bracket; only to now have to face Ehome. 

But I believe in Alliance.

I'm too invested in this team to give up. My life expectancy probably has gone down by 10 years because of this, but I'm in too far to pull out now: it's balls deep or nothing. 

I believe in Alliance.

I always tell my teammates this, when they start calling GG 20 mins in: The game isn't over until our Ancient is dead. How can we win if we don't believe that we will?

So I believe in Alliance.

And I'll keep on believing, until my last dying breath. Alliance will win TI6. ALLIANCE WILL WIN TI6. And even if they don't, I'll be damned if they don't provide us some of the most interesting matches of the tournament. 

I BELIEVE IN ALLIANCE.

Loda, Akke, S4, EGM, Bulldog, I believe in you. Never give up hope, for you'll always have ours. I'm an Alliance fangay and I'm proud of it. There are thousands of us, proud to bear the Alliance flair. And, although I believe you guys can win, that's not why I root for you. You are my favorite team not just because of skill, but because you care about having fun, because you care about why we started playing Dota in the first place. I never have as much fun watching other teams play as I have when watching you guys. 

I believe in Alliance.

In my heart, Alliance was never back. Because Alliance was never gone in the first place. 

I believe in Alliance.~|personal esports
I am the support. I am the Captain of S.S. Dumbfuck.|self.DotA2|~For the first time in four days I decided it's time to play ranked again. I queued up, Europe West/East. Almost 5 minutes, huh? I am this special? The bans begun. I ban Tinker, as always, because FUCK Tinker. Picking phase. My hopes to play Omniknight got dashed, enemy instalocks Enigma first. I go for Rubick. Mostly because it's a direct counter, but this is the hero I know the best and played the most. Enemy goes for Slark, Clinkz and Bloodseeker. Wow, this is gonna be hell of a ride.

The game starts. I tell my teammates on voip to be careful this game, since the enemy has 3 strong ganking heroes. I lane with Void, against the Clinkz. My partner last hits alright, but I am unable to zone the enemy, since he beats the shit out of me with Searing Arrows. I gave first blood because of that. Quick TP back, warding the jungle and securing the 2:00 rune, but soon I realize I won't be able to do much in this lane and that Void is doing his passive farm alright without my help. I grab the haste rune and rotate top, where Drow Ranger feeds regularly to Slark, Lion and Bloodseeker. We kill Bloodseeker. Top lane becomes much more quiet since I'm there. I remind my teammates using microphone, that our plan this game is to survive and wait for the late game. I decide to build Arcane Boots and Mekansm since I am the only support in my team.

Minutes pass by with me trying to stop Slark from free farming top, as unexpectedly everyone else left the top lane. 4 enemies devour our safelane Void. Then things go fully haywire. A real clusterfuck on bot, while I lane top against the alone Slark. Wait a minute, I think, as a support I should be there, even though this lane is deserted by our team. I TP bot, we take the tower. Things start to look good to us, Invoker is getting the kills and he pushed mid tower already too. We look at enemy top T1 and move there. We start pushing together against a lone support, then Enigma with Bloodseeker rotate and gank the shit out of us. Not good. Invoker dies. This is about 15 minute mark. He disconnects. First thought - Ragequit. I check his Steam profile. Mongolia. Maybe the electricity died in his entire village, I say to myself. We pause. The enemy unpauses and starts throwing insults in Russian. We pause again, and I ask them to wait, using the very basic Russian I learned in school back in the days. "Podozdi, on vyernulsya". They don't want to pause and insult us again.

Drow feeds some more. I tell Void, that he's the carry now, with Invoker out and Drow not showing much promise. He farms safely bot and in the jungle, while we are being punished very hard on other lanes. Good, the late game will come, and that's where he's going to shine. The guy who plays Spirit Breaker starts to play Invoker, too, now that the other guy has abandoned the match. He isn't doing well. We start to lose the territory and being ganked every time. Things are getting worse every minute.

I maintain the vision with observers and sentries on two lanes and defensively in the jungle and tell my teammates, that this is where we have to stay. For the next 20 minutes. We need to survive till the late game, while carries will get the farm. We need Drow and Void to get so big, they will stomp the enemy. Meanwhile, the Drow is dying again. Void is getting impatient. He writes: "REPORT DROW". All in caps, someone's upset. "Why is that?" I ask. "0/8" he types. "This is not a valid reason for report" I reply, calmly. "Look, I know you are angry, but she's doing her best, okay? Things are gonna be good. Just wait for the late game, but this is not going to happen until next twenty minutes". The guy playing Spirit Breaker asks me if he can play Invoker too. I tell him it's okay, as long as he knows what he's doing. I finish Guardian Greaves. I know we're gonna need them.

We play defensively, and occasionally kill Slark or Clinkz when they try to attack alone from invisibility. We have sentries, no way they are gonna succeed as long as we stick together. They finally try to push the highground. We wait it out and pick them one by one when they do so. When my guys are trying to chase, I use the voip to call them back. This is not safe, with invisible enemy trying to lure us in an ambush. They listen to me, and we feed a lot less from now on. Drow Ranger reminds us to save some money for buybacks. I ask Void, can he buy me sentries, since I want to have money for buyback. He gets me like 20 of them. The Spirit Breaker guy plays Invoker very well, and his Tornado - Deafening Blast - Meteor combos help us a lot!

The things are getting more intense. The late game is getting closer, and their assaults are getting more fierce. Enigma uses Blackhole a few times, but he has no BKB so I interrupt it easily, then steal it. One of such attacks, I catch 4 of them in a stolen Blackhole, then Void uses Chronosphere. Epic and easy! I am able to buy the Scythe of Vyse thanks to the money we earned by defending.

The game goes very late. After 50-60 minute mark Void and Drow are much stronger than the entire enemy team! We wipe them out a few times. I command who has to stay, and who pushes (we lost mid racks and bot highground tower already). We get their racks one after one during such wipeouts. We play safe, because nobody wants to lose. Finally, we got megacreeps. The tension is huge. We kill them. They buyback. We kill them again. We get to the ancient!

I shout "We did it! We did it! Wooooo!" on the mic while the enemy ancient crumbles. Void types in caps: "ALL COMMEND RUBICK"... The proud of myself and my teammates is overwhelming me.

Thank you Slacks, for showing me how important the communication using the microphone is in this game. Thank you the Spirit Breaker player *seekm3* for playing two heroes at once (I checked his Dotabuff and it turned out he plays mostly Invoker). Thank you my team for trusting me and believing in the victory!

The match on Dotabuff: http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2704789550

TL;DR: I won the ranked game 4 vs 5 because one guy played two heroes, because I led my team using the microphone, because we waited til the late game and because the enemy was a team of tryhard CIS-countries ragers and I wanted to share my story.~|personal
The most adorable thing happened today|self.DotA2|~I wanted to play a little with 2 mates that havent really played a lot of dota so I logged into an alternative account to play some unranked with them.

In this game however there was a little ukranian kid, he sounded like he was 11-12 years old or something in his mic and he instant picked pudge and wanted to go mid. He had Dendis set also. He was so happy that he managed to pick pudge so he went nuts saying "YES", "PUDGE)))" "IM PUDGE".

At first I thought "ohgod.jpg" because that dosent usually end up very well but we let him go mid because whatever, he actually tried to communicate in english with us the best he could.

He did actually very ok from himself, rotated a lot and got some great hooks, everytime he got a hook he cheered "YES", "HOOK", "DENDI HOOK" and wrote "hooks)". "OPA)". "OYOYYOOYOY)"

His joyfullness of getting a good hook with pudge made him so happy everytime.

It was actually a very fun game to play. I then looked at his steam profile and his profile picture seemed to be a photo of him holding a photo of Dendi and that was so adorable. I dont remember what he nicked, it was something in cryllic letters so I cant find his profile.

But that was so adorable meeting such a fan from Dendi like that in a pub, totally killed the CIS-player stereotype.

I just wanted to share this story. Peace.~|personal

Everything I know about Dota is wrong|self.DotA2|~I just played a low priority game on US West English, where I was literally the only English speaker in the game. Everyone else was speaking spanish or not talking at all.

We had an insta-pick invoker who called mid and someone who picked meepo. We also had an ogre magi who was constantly DCing

They were all good. I can't believe it, but they were good. Our invoker did his best to communicate with the team and plan out what we were doing, even using broken english to try to include me. He and ogre magi made my tiny so powerful by keeping alacrity and bloodlust on during teamfights. Meepo didn't feed, and in fact ended the game with the best score of anyone. 

At the end invoker said "commend tiny" and I swear I almost broke down crying guys. My world has been turned upside down.

I've been playing for 3 days. I'm a total newb but I'm getting there. I'd like to thank all the people who helped me.|self.DotA2|~A couple of days ago I created [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3akp50/im_new_how_do_i_find_people_to_play_with/) asking for people to play with.  Well my inbox lit up and I have over 20 friends now.

This game is amazing.  Until the last game I just played I'd probably say, 'this game sucks.'  I kept dying and people kept flaming me.  Well one of the people from the thread decided to coach me and well... jeez was that fun.  

I picked a core for the first time, Viper, and he was giving me tips.  I was following his instruction but I still ended up dying in mid lane.  To make matters worse they had a Riki who knew what he was doing.  I didn't know what I was doing.  I just remember at one point my coach saying:

"If Riki attacks you step out of the smoke and turn and ult him and you can take him."

"Riki just bought item A, you're going to need a monkey king bar."

"You can't turn and face Riki anymore, if he attacks you just shadowblade away."

"Riki just bought a Rapier, this game is over... you don't want to be out on the map."

As soon as Riki got the Rapier they 5 manned us and attacked us mid lane and that's when something spectacular happened.  As they were raxxing us Mid lane our Doom went out and pushed their base and took out two sets of rax.

Before doing this Doom left a gift at the base, he bought a Gem of Truesight.  Upon respawning I picked up the Gem and went on the hunt for Riki with my monkey king bar, shadowblade, and gem.  I ran into Riki right at the river in middle lane and he was all alone.  I ulted him and spammed Q and he died and dropped his rapier and I picked it up.

All of a sudden the Rapier is on our side and now they're on the defensive.  I was so scared.  My heart was racing.  I didn't want to lose the Rapier or the Gem.  Everytime I saw someone I shadowbladed and ran away.  

We ended up winning the game and my coach was stunned.  He was sure we were going to lose.  Riki went 36-8 or 38-6 and we still managed to win.

Never did my heart race so much during a video game.

This game is amazing.  

**edit: thanks so much for the replies, my inbox has exploded.  I can't add you guys because my steam account is level 0.  I'll try to buy a compendium tonight so I can add people.

Dota 2 never cease to amaze me! Tricks that blows my mind!|self.DotA2|~There are always new things to learn even after 3000 hours into the game. 


Just last week i learned about Chen send back creeps trick and it blows my mind. Chen can send 3 melee creeps back for the offlane at 0 minute mark. The offlaner can get solo exp of full creep wave and reach level 2 before 1 minute mark. This trick works so well in current meta. Some self-sufficient offlaners such as timber/weaver/lc benefit so much from the early level advantage against enemy tri-safelane.



And last night, while watching singsing stream, a techies player in his team use a very interesting trick that i have never think of in my whole life of doto. Offlaner Techies use suicide at level 1 to kill creepwave and gain level 2. TP to lane, use proximity mine on creepwave and then proceed to stand ON TOP of the mine. Enemy melee carry can't right click the mine due to techies hitbox is protecting the mine hitbox. Besides, who would have imagine that a carry will lose laning phase 1v1 against a techies. Normal techies will just plant mines on trees and feed extra gold to carry.


How the hell people keep coming up with these neat tricks? What have i done with my life? ~|personal

I respect Valve so much|self.DotA2|~I don't think there is any other company which deny possibilities to earn a lot of money just by copying their old work.

They could just do similiar battlepass as each before and they could earn milions $ easly, they could just give us weekly BattleCup even with small rewards and i think they still could earn a lot from tickets.

But this is Valve. I trust them so much that they will release when it's done which will be much better than any other battlepass before.

Some may say that this is laziness, but i am sure that Valve has greater plan about their games what we don't know now.~|personal

I abandoned a game as soon as I noticed our Luna had tucked in our courier inside her hitbox and was marching down the mid tower to feed.|self.DotA2|~

As soon as I noticed her almost dead, I hit F9 and disconnected on the spot before the match would be counted on first blood. 


It saddens me that the luna probably got to ruin some other people's match right afterward.
I just wanted to not ruin the rest of the player's new year, and took the -25 myself.

 Happy 2018!


Edit: To all the wellwishers, yes, Karma served me well and I got 2 amazing coordinating teams the next two games I played and I got +50. Cheers guys!~|personal

I introduced my 11 yo niece to DotA|self.DotA2|~And her 15 yo friend at the same time. I was visiting my hometown for Christmas and I saw them playing the game that should not be named. We reminisced how she was watching me play it (yes, dark times) in the past and I suggested that they try out DotA. So, they download steam and the game and the ~~shit~~show began.  
They have never used steam, so partying up  was the first hurdle to overcome. We tried adding via steam profile links (I taught them how to use Discord, but that's a different story). We tried a local chat channel in DotA, a user channel, even a PRIVATE channel (where you have to specifically add the person in question via a command). None worked, because their accounts were obviously restricted. Really Valve? Okay, we even somehow managed to find each others DotA profiles, though I'm not sure how. Honestly, at that point I was on the verge of giving up and assuming that Valve considers new Steam/DotA players so irrelevant that they don't give a damn about those 2 unlikely players. BUT, it turned out you can add a player via DotA ID... to friends. It obviously didn't work, but we managed to party up with that feature. So... all this was nothing compared to what happened afterwards. It's hard to put into words but I'll try my best.  
We kicked off with the tutorial. They have both finished the first part, albeit cluelesly, even though they play the L game. Then came the DK game and oh boy... I can't remember the last time I felt so helpless and ashamed about something. The tutorial is GARBAGE. A big, stinking pile of crap. It's like being praised for graduating kindergarten as a kid after the first mission followed by solving damn integrals in the second. Honestly, what the hell? They both lost interest immediately after being thrown into such deep water. Two new fresh souls, young eager grills, beaten by a frigging tutorial.  My niece said that it's hard (no surprise here) and that she will maybe play when I visit again in the future, but she'd much rather only watch. She also said that her biggest problem was with a lack of camera lock on your hero.  
Valve please, you can do better than this, start from allowing players to add each other to a party at least!, followed by a community-driven arcade based tutorial contest for eager modders. If you didn't mind dumping 30k on Frostivus, surely you can spend as much on a proper tutorial, with basic concepts and mechanics explained? You can treat it as an investment into new players.
For all those that lasted till the end, thank you for reading. Proof here: https://imgur.com/a/VMoE1  
TL;DR New Steam/DotA players can't party up easily and are being discouraged by the garbage quality tutorial.~|personal

VikingDota on Facebook steals people content that is posted here and uses them for promotional gains. It sells accounts most importantly.|self.DotA2|~That shit stain of a page sells accounts. 300k bought likes.  I want Valve to pull the ban hammer. I'm not an intellectual property lawyer but I'm 100% sure selling accounts is a violation of term of use.  HAVE YOU LOST MMR TO DOGE SHIT ACCOUNT BUYERS WHO QUEUE IN YOUR 4-5K MATCH, AND PLAY LIKE FUCKING 1K. THESE PEOPLE, THESE DISGUSTING, UNETHICAL AND IMMORAL DONKEY FUCKERS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THAT PAIN AND SUFFERING. Account purchasing is getting out of control. I pray to baby jesus that our God Emperor - Lord Gaben of House Valve, first of his name, turns his sight and unleashes the power of deez nuts.

(Real talk) This crisis is affecting players in all regions and seriously affecting games. It's a problem that is beyond Valve and contributing to ruined games. People who play frequently will inevitably experience this unfortunate circumstance where an individual pulls out his credit card because he feels "entitled" to a higher MMR bracket. It's affecting players who are genuinely good but can't break the impenetrable doge shit barrier because a simple 4000 MMR account costs you between $10-15. A better analogy is the weight of the doge shit will not only eventually break your back but permanently cripple your ability to stand.
