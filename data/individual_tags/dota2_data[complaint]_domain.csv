Disqualified from TI6 open qualifiers due to error by the coordinators of the event, faceit.com|self.DotA2|~Extremely frustrated with faceit.com (website coordinating the open qualifiers for TI6)

tl;dr My team was disqualified from the open qualifiers of TI6 because the admins started our second game while we were still in our first, and wouldn't allow us back into the first round of the open qualifiers.

My team (MFG__) competed in the The International 2016 open qualifier Americas #1.  In the lobby for our first match, the opposing team failed to join in time to play the match, and it was therefore ended.  However, our team was not awarded the win.  After contacting the admins, *FACEIT Sue* joined our lobby and restarted the match.  So we played our match and won.

However, after our match was complete we found out on faceit they started our second match while we were still playing the first one.  Since we were in the middle of our first game, we couldn't join the lobby for the second one and the admins disqualified us, allowing the other team to advance.

We voiced our complaints with *FACEIT Sue* who told us we were out of luck and eliminated from the tournament.  After continuing to argue our case, she redirected us to *FACEIT_Mikey* to hear our concerns.  But the only way to talk with someone directly through their website is the friend them.  I have friended *FACEIT_Mikey* but as of this time he has not accepted.

Inside the match rooms the conversations between my team and the admin can be viewed

Yes, we could still participate in the second round of open qualifiers, but my team arranged their schedules to play at this time and are unavailable for the second round of qualifiers



**Update:** foreverdaed was able to contact [/u/Faceit_Mikey](https://www.reddit.com/u/Faceit_Mikey) through faceit's chat client today.  I can't link to that chat window, but if you believe me here's their conversation: [http://textuploader.com/53hk5](http://textuploader.com/53hk5)

While he apologizes that this happened to us, he defends and reiterates it wasn't there fault.  From his and [kidovate's excellent response](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4p8qf5/disqualified_from_ti6_open_qualifiers_due_to/d4j28bt) I believe they are in part true - why did Valve choose to still do their patching during what is likely the busiest days and busiest times they will have all year?  And why did they not coordinate their patch/API changes with Faceit, who Valve must have known would surely be impacted by it?

I hope Faceit, Valve, or both take the next step and admit this ruined the open qualifiers not just for my team, but reading through these comments and Faceit_Mickey's comments, other teams as well.  I hope they try to do something to compensate or show their sincerity.  Yes faceit is working on improving their system so this type of scenario doesn't happen again, but that doesn't fix the fact that my team was unfairly left out of fully participating and enjoying TI6.~|complaint esports
Bring 2GD back|self.DotA2|~Bring your support here guys, we all know that Valve keeps an eye out on reddit. 

The return of James was a great addition to the first Shanghai Major, even when it was going to shit with the stream cuts, audio problems and so forth. Bring him back, he did a great job, even with so much downtime. 


UPDATE 1: [@follow2GD](https://twitter.com/follow2GD/status/703133163590017024?lang=en)

UPDATE 2: [@follow2GD](https://twitter.com/follow2GD/status/703247410181464064?lang=en)

2016-02-26 16:00 UTC

>Going to sleep on it (statement). It's a very very odd situation. more than meets the eye you could say.

For users from /r/all:

James "2GD" Harding is a dota 2(ARTS video game) panel host who mediates a panel of dota 2 experts in discussing the games that have happened/ will happen soon as well as the teams who will be playing the games. Think soccer round-table host, talking about the soccer match before and after. 

He's known for being unconventionally entertaining (with British banter, swearing etc.), and Valve has told James [to "be himself" for the event](https://twitter.com/follow2GD/status/703133163590017024?lang=en). 

The working theory right now is that he apparently stepped on too many toes, extending one of his segments for too long and got released as a result. There has been no official statement regarding the situation yet, but the reality is that James is no longer hosting the panel, having been replaced by Jorien "Sheever" van der Heijden, the other host at the event.

There's more backlash as a result of very vocal negative community feedback about the tournament's production, which has resulted in the broadcast stream cutting twice today, audio issues as well as timing issues. This is evident in the stream over at www.twitch.tv/dotamajor, which is, at 8:42 SGT, still spamming "Bring back James" memes.

Valve, this "Not tradeable, Not marketable, Not giftable" trend has GOT to stop.|self.DotA2|~Edit: Whoa, reddit gold, thanks! Edit 2: front page of /r/all ?! reddit gold x8 ?! PogChamp 
I just hope the post somehow helps...

~~~~~~~~

&nbsp;

I posted this in the patch notes, but a bunch of people commented asking me to re-post it as a thread.

&nbsp;

~~~~~~~~

I just spent $10 on a compendium and I can't even GIFT the courier, etc to a friend.

&nbsp;

Looking at Valve's policy:

&nbsp;

2013

- All items: Tradeable/Marketable immediately

&nbsp;

Like a frog in a frying pan (pun not intended), one by one they have slowly turned into:

2015

- Sets I purchase: Not tradable or marketable for 3 months

- Compendiums I purchase: Not tradable, marketable, or giftable for 1 week

- Items I work for in-game: Not tradeable or marketable EVER

- Items from the TI5 compendium I purchased: Not tradeable or marketable for 3 months, but giftable

- Half of the items from the Fall 2015 compendium I purchased: Not tradeable, marketable, or giftable for 3 months

- The other half of the items from the Fall 2015 compendium I purchased: Not tradeable, marketable, or giftable EVER 

&nbsp;

I've been in the Valve ecosystem and spent thousands as a paying customer since 2007. I *hate* sounding entitled, but when I'm paying, I do feel entitled to *own* the items I pay for, and I think people who work for their items should have a sense of ownership of them too.

&nbsp;

At this point, we're penalized far more by the "anti-abuse safeguards" than the side-effects that abuse has on devaluing our items, etc. [Kotaku had a great post today](http://steamed.kotaku.com/steam-customer-service-is-still-terrible-1734354928) about Steam Support still not responding for months to legit customer account issues, so these lockdowns don't seem to have fixed that.

&nbsp;

I don't care if my items aren't "worth" much due to abuse-related inflation, or about people who are scammed by someone promising something in return for an item, or whether a handful of workshop artists can make a living off selling item sets by making the hundreds of thousands of paying customers deal with these restrictions (now THAT is entitled) -- seriously, half the people here are complaining about item set overload anyways.

&nbsp;

But I do care about being able to legitimately trade/sell/share/gift like I can when I own something in real life. Heck, I play with IRL dota friends, including one where I, heh, *forcefully loaned* a Na'Vi flag to the wall of his office for TI5... ;) -- why can't I interact with my in-game items the same way?

&nbsp;

It's not even just the heavily-paying dota addicts -- I'm an admin for an amature league, and regularly get new people asking me about dota. Quite a few times people have asked me why their Dota Battle Point level has to be a certain level (still not even documented by the wiki, because no one knows what the algorithm is) before they can start trading items, even though they've been paying customers on steam for *years*. Other people weren't able to give their friend a compendium before TI (or missed things like event predictions) because of the 1-week no-gift restriction. 

&nbsp;

Many have proposed roughly the same thing, and something like it would make a lot of sense. 

1) Active customers who have bought stuff on steam, had security enabled, and haven't had any account problems in the last year: No restrictions.

This works around

- Credit card thieves who make brand new steam accounts

- Dead/unused accounts being stolen

- At-risk acounts

- Repeat offenders

2) New accounts: All items not marketable/tradeable, but giftable, for 1 week (maybe disallow gifting or re-gifting if the credit card hasn't been registered for a week and gray market scams are still a killer thing) 

This supports

- Newbies who want to buy a gift for someone, or buy a steam gift to play with a friend -- they weren't going to trade those soon anyways.

- Plenty of time for Valve to auto-revoke gifts received that were fraudulently purchased.

3) Repeat offenders, etc: Total lockdown or whatever

&nbsp;

This probably isn't the final solution, and it's certainly open to abuse, but it's closer to where the mentality should be.

&nbsp;

I think paying customers need to make this issue more visible to Valve.~|complaint

Yo Valve, FYI, the way you have the store setup... You're breaking the law and liable for criminal charges and up to $600,000 in fines, per infraction.|self.DotA2|~# **[Update Two (31 March 2016): We DIDNT do it it Reddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4cnhs8/im_sorry_this_has_to_be_brought_up_again_but_we/)**

After reviewing the changes made, its clear they have only modified the store page itself.  I take responsibility for this as I never explicitly insisted that the hero pages be fixed too.  [If you do the same thing from the hero page, you can be mislead into buying a treasure rather than a set.](https://imgur.com/ENfGyyM)

# DotA players: 0 - Valve: 1

# Valve released an update but did a half ass job.

---


If you were to browse the DotA2 Store, and look to buy (for example) "Daemonfell Flame" for LC, the store lists the price as $3.69 (New Zealand).

This is actually the cost of Winter Treasure IV, with a snowballs chance in hell of actually getting the set you're after.

This amounts to a breach of New Zealand's Fair Trading Act (false or misleading), and has criminal liability as well as other shit.

I know I've just listed New Zealand here.  But I know that the same rules apply in most countries. Definitely England, Canada, and Australia.  I just don't know what the penalty is for those guys (likely similar).

TLDR:  You're breaking the law Valve


Edit: For all the people downvoting this:  The requirement to fall afoul of the Act is that the representation being made is "likely or possibly" misleading.  There is no requirement that the vendor *intends* to deceive, nor is it necessary for the customer to not be mislead or deceived.

Edit 2:  Looks like for the same offence, in Australia, it could be "up to $1.1 million" (I haven't looked into this specific punishment 100%)

Crowd, STFU|self.DotA2|~That is all.

Edit: For the latecomers and /r/all:

We're currently spectating The International 2016, a massive Dota2 tournament organized by Valve. As the event is being presented (cast), the crowd is yelling (howling) "WOOOO!!" at the top of their lungs, for no discernible reason other than attention. This is extremely disruptive for those in the arena and for those viewing at home, as well as the casters. It warranted an immediate shoutout and Tweets from personalities to put a stop to it.~|complaint esports
My team lost the finals of Starladder without even playing it. Our opponents didn't reply, and for some reasons we lost by forfeit, and were given -30 points for 'flooding', when we tried to contact the admins. No explanation at all. All evidence is provided.|self.DotA2|~Our name is CasGam (Casual Gamers). 

* Here is our interaction with admins, where you can clearly see we were promptly ready after our previous game. We finished our games, and followed the procedure (As is documented in the link)
http://dota2.starladder.tv/forum/categories/719/67078

* This is the tournament is question, as you can see, the finals were forfeited. We still have not recieved word as to why.  http://dota2.starladder.tv/tournament/8892

* Most of our games were casted by an official caster, who validated that we did not do anything badly mannered in our games. 

* As a rather new team, we were very happy to be able to play in the finals. It sucks to be let down that hard, and not even be given a reason from the admins as to why. Furthermore, the fact that we are the ones being punished for trying to contact the admins, as the others were not answering.

* We were told by an admin that the finals could not be decided by the decision of the admins, yet it was.

* The opposing team claims to have contacted us, but never did. 

* What do you think we should do about this? Is anyone from Starladder able to give me an explanation?~|complaint esports
Valve, the first custom game you monetized is a collection of rip-offs and theft|self.DotA2|~Do you people even check what you approve on the workshop and your own Workshop Legal Agreement? The game Roshpit Champions uses **a lot** of stolen assets and is despite all of that now being monetized.    
The developers took icons, art and models from other artists and developers, simply implemented them in the game and did not even credit those (not to mention that they are monetizing work that they have no rights to).

As far as the legal agreement goes, everyone who uploads anything to the workshop agrees to:

> D. Representations and Warranties

> "You represent and warrant to us that you have sufficient rights in all User Generated Content to grant Valve and other affected parties the licenses described under A. and B. above or in any license terms specific to the applicable Workshop-Enabled App or Workshop page. This includes, without limitation, any kind of intellectual property rights or other proprietary or personal rights affected by or included in the User Generated Content. In particular, with respect to Workshop Contributions, you represent and warrant that the Workshop Contribution was originally created by you (or, with respect to a Workshop Contribution to which others contributed besides you, by you and the other contributors, and in such case that you have the right to submit such Workshop Contribution on behalf of those other contributors)."

Yet apparently that did not matter here at all. Here are a few examples of the things they have stolen:  

[adamantine_samurai_helmet](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/roshpitchampions/images/6/60/Adamantine_Samurai_Helmet.png) taken from the loading screen of the FrozenYoroi Warrior set (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=413240800). Item has NOT been approved in the workshop, thus not property of Valve. Artist has not been credited whatsoever.  
[admirals_boot](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/roshpitchampions/images/1/1a/Admiral%27s_Boots.png) taken from a Kunkka set called Resolute Seafarer (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=393577229). Same applies as before   
Arcanys Slippers cropped from the alchemist's boots from the set Alchemist's unbeaten willpower (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=505427981) Same applies as before   
armor_of_secret_temple taken from Blossoms Mystical Regalia (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=374007647)    
avalanche_plate taken from The Perennial Giant (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=454511369)  
blinded_glint_of_onu taken from Ima and Mirai  masks for Juggernaut (https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=322410185)   
brazen_kabuto_of_the_desert_realm taken from the Firebirds Awakening set (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=449352855)   
centaur_horns taken from the Horned Barbarian Set (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=148146035)   
[crusader_boots](http://puu.sh/nIlg6/534fb94c2f.png) taken from Darion and Alexandros Morgaine's boots from **World of Warcraft (Blizzard Entertainment)**  
cytopian_laser_glove taken from the fulminous punisher set for Razor (https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=337596845)   
dark_arts_vestments taken from the Theasures of Dark Rift  
death_whisper_helm taken from Haze Whisperer (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=471001280)   
doomplate taken from Flames of Tarrasque, a Doom Set for Mag (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=273325094)   
dragon_ceremony_vestments taken from Lord of the storm - SET (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=409276539)   
emerald_douli taken from Crystal hat of eternity (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=209424275)   
energizing_quest_gear taken from Guardian of the Manta Style Set (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631285990)   
featherwhite_armor taken from Featherwhite Regalia set (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=425192619)   


All of these assets and far more are just a few examples that were taken from loading screens and item previews. I did not bother linking every icon, you can look it up yourself on their wiki or in the game. They copypasted and cropped what they needed from fanart and sets and used it. At least one of them was taken from World of Warcraft which is even worse. I didn't check every single icon, only a third of them but I bet almost all art assets follow the same pattern. If the set has not been implemented in the store then the art still belongs to their respective artist and artists do not automatically give up their rights.   

The models of the [house/s](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/353899007301408244/11C9A3F3D8AFAFCD8901D0420DB398E4D9BF3A08) they use in the starter area was taken from Curse of River's End. Obviously the author wasn't credited either and is not getting anything from the revenue. I would like to know where the other models are coming from, they look completely out of place and pasted from another game.    

I also wonder where they got the music from. There is no one credited for that. Could be royalty-free music or stolen as well. Even then, I believe you still have to credit royalty-free music.  

I obviously can't and don't want to check every single asset they stole because the 50+ are more than enough to raise the question: Is this really acceptable? It's already pretty damn shady when someone steals from another developer and uses it in his 'hobby-mod' but when things get ACTUALLY monetized on the workshop that are full with rip-offs, then I do question Valve's integrity there. No one cared about checking the legitimacy of the game and just put it on the workshop so they can start reaping money. Not even gonna talk about the P2W pass or the fact that the game was completely unplayable right after it got the pass, coincides with all of that talk in the interview about high quality standards and professionalism.   
A horrible example to start support for this scene. I can understand if one or two things got overlooked or are an honest mistake but this is certainly no mistake and Valve did not bother to ask themselves where it came from. This isn't the first time this happens with Valve either. Valve had multiple cases across their games where UGC turned out to be completely stolen (I think it was the mace for Void in Dota, haven't played back then so correct me if I'm wrong).   

Is this really something Valve wants to encourage? Ripping off from all kinds of people, put it in the game and get paid and rewarded? I doubt developers will like that kind of workshop or the artists that they stole from. Pretty funny to see Valve talking about establishing a future for the scene and how they took DMCA very seriously and then they completely ignore all of it.

*"a certain level of professionalism should be expected from custom game creators offering premium passes. I wouldn't like to see custom games drop to the level of money-grab mobile games. I have high standards for myself and Roshpit Champions and I would appreciate if peer games did as well."* -  ChalkyBrush

**Edit:** Since I was downvoted asking for a source, here a clarification, courtesy of /u/Endritv:
[According to Valve](http://i.imgur.com/QuCAIWz.png), you DO keep the rights to your IP when you upload something so this is **not** property of Valve and [still belongs to the artist](http://i.imgur.com/ZUS00vt.png), making this still theft.~|complaint

Hello ESL, I'm cancelling my trip to Katowice|self.DotA2|~I bought tickets to the Arena right on the first day, travel tickets, booked a good hotel in downtown, wanted to spend some money over there. Merch, Polish food, visiting local stuff with my wife, having some kurwa good Dota experience.

But thanks to your arrogant bitchy behaviour, you can fuck off. I'm cancelling this whole trip. As you will keep the money I paid for the tickets, you can buy some fake fb viewers to reach the 10k dream.

Viewing on facebook? First I didn't think there would be problem for me as I'm on FB. Didn't even think there would be any issue, I mean you are ESL, this is what you do for living, right? You are a service provider, an organizer, you know what we, the players, need. 
I tried to watch your stream on fb. It's shit. S H I T. Not the casters, it's the quality of the stream, with all the retarded emojis, delays, kales.

I prefer to have epileptic seizures from twitch memes rather than from those shitty emoticons on fb. No, I don't want to watch it on full screen. 

And you just keep shutting down the "rival"? Are you insane?

I was really looking for my first IRL Dota experience, but maybe another time with another organizer.

Valve, this custom game contest is a bad joke|self.DotA2|~As we all know Valve gave modders this awesome opportunity to show themselves and earn some money with the brand new custom game contest.

And all was good and everyone was happy in the modderland until Valve decided that we are having too much fun with it and everything is just too bright and sweet.

On release of 7.07 the modding tools were unavailable for around 24 hours due to Valve seemingly forgetting to push a file into the release build. Now, it might have been more complicated than that, shit happens, I get it. They even responded to an email detailing the bug and told us the fix was rolling out soon. Good guy Valve, right? Not really though. The update brought many breaking changes including the rework of the whole attribute system, changing how mana and health regen works and all that jazz. Obviously a lot of existing games depended heavily on how stats worked and their creators had to stop working on their contest entries and go and fix their games. But this isn't even the main issue.

The main issue is **COMMUNICATION**. I'll just list the things we were **NOT** communicated about in no particular order:

1. The removal of old regen-related functions from the API. Just like that. Not deprecated, straight up removed. Used them? Deal with it.
2. The complete turnaround of how herolist.txt (a file used to restrict the list of picked heroes in a custom game) worked. An addition of an activelist.txt which you had to go and figure out. Many games depended on it.
3. Changing the return type of GetBehavior function. Used by many, broke a lot. Then they changed it back.
4. The change of RespawnHero signature. Just like that, no fallback method. Just removed an argument. Stupid, probably unnecessary and broke many games for a small amount of time. That time, however, adds up.
5. The model editor situation. An absolutely crucial tool in the modder's arsenal, used to look up model animations now silently crashes when you try to open any model which doesn't have a source file. And we don't have source files for any of the Valve models. I guess it's not a crucial bug since it's not broken for Valve themselves, right? I sent a complete bug description with a crash dump the day it broke, Nov 2. Yet to see a fix (how many updates have there been in those days? 15? 20?) or hear a response. There are only so many days left until the deadline.
6. None of the other numerous API additions and changes. How hard it is to go through your own commits and compile a list of things you worked on?

You would think the update was a long con thing and it just so happened to align with the contest, too bad, shit happens. You would think they would just clean up after it and stop breaking things. Jokes on you.

Yesterday they introduced a breaking change which messes up ability button keys in a lot of custom games and which I'm yet to figure out. Because figuring that out and fixing that takes time. Which I have to do, or my already limping game will just die. And I just built a list of things I need to do for my contest entry this week, because it's practically the last week you can put in serious work, since you need at least a week for public testing. Less than 2 weeks remaining, how much more of that bullcrap are we going to withstand?

Shame on you, Valve. You have neglected us for a year now, and now you are breaking our hearts. We all thought you were [UGC oriented](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zkfmv/wearea_videogame_developer_aua/cfufdfl/). [The bot scripts forum](https://dev.dota2.com/forumdisplay.php?f=497) clearly shows that communication with developers is possible, meanwhile the custom games forum is a complete wasteland.

EDIT: Just wanted to point out that we collaborated as a community and created a separate bug/requests tracker on github. We were very happy when Valve responded to issues there. Once. That never happened again. And on topic of API updates: again we as a community created VAC-unsafe tools which hook up into the dota2 binary and dump the changes in the API. Risky, heavy, unstable, unreliable, only for server code. Still, if we can do it from the outside automatically, why can't Valve? Oh yeah, and clientside UI documentation dump has been broken for like 6 months now.

EDIT2: For everyone saying that they can't account for custom games when they are changing their code and that things will always break: read the post more carefully. The breakage is inevitable as long as the game is evolving. No need to compare with Wc3 which had patches once per 3-4 months or rarer. The IMPORTANT thing there is communicating the changes before they happen, communicating that an important bug is getting worked on or is not getting worked on.~|complaint

Valve, it's been over 250 days since the last hero was released.|self.DotA2|~**As of today (Nov. 11 - 2015), it's been 273 days since the last hero (Winter Wyvern) was released (back on Feb. 11 - 2015).**

To put that into perspective:

The distance between Winter Wyvern and Oracle (The previous hero), is **91 Days**.

And the distance between Oracle and Techies: **77 Days**.

--------------------
The longest time between hero releases *was* **218 days**, which is the days between the release of Techies and New Bloom, but that was 2 heroes in the same day (Terrorblade &amp; Phoenix: Jan. 29 - 2014).

Legion commander was released only **48 days** before New Bloom.

And both Ember Spirit &amp; Earth Spirit were released **27 Days** before Legion Commander.

I could go on but I think the point is made. *Make some noise pls.* Even if they were planning on releasing both heroes at once it's been a really long time.

Truth about IG.|self.DotA2|~(Posting for Ana since his post was removed)

Hi guys,

Everything you're about to read is the truth, and even though it probably won't help me I hope others learn from my mistake.I never wanted to post or bring this drama to the public but I have exhausted all possible channels of communication and I am at my wits end. 

I guess most of you don't know me since I'm not a top player, so I'll give a brief intro to my background. I'm a 16 year old Australian born Chinese/Viet mix who left the final year of high school to try play dota2 professionally and my family isn't exactly well off so my success in dota is very important. My friend & manager, Tian (CEO of gogosu.com, a Chinese dota2 coaching platform) helped me piece my thoughts and write this post. 

Proof its me.

Tian has been my friend even before I went to China, we used to play Aus pubs together a lot and when he understood my situation he recommended me to try pro dota2 for a year. With the help of Tian I left for China on 17th of Jan and stayed with hes family until end of March, during this period Tian used his connections in China and had vouched for me to trial at different clubs, EHOME.K, VG.R and IG. I was very new to pro dota and seriously sucked so I was beyond ecstatic that IG were interested in offering me a position.

Tian helped me read and alter a thick contract between IG, ACE and myself. Initially the contract was heavily favored toward IG and left very little protection to myself. IG could let go of me as they wished, didn't guarantee me prize money split, couldn't guarantee me play time and was a two year long contract. The offer was for me to play as IGV's main player, but that Ferrari430 may come back at some point and at that point I could either switch to the other IG roster or play as sub.

Because of this Tian made multiple adjustments to the proposed contract including but not limited to the following,

* I would have equal prize money with all 5 players in non valve events whether I was a main player or sub
* I would have equal prize money with 4 players (BBK, XXS, QD, Rong but excluding Ferrari430) in Valve events
* The contract would only last 1 year instead of 2
* That I would be guaranteed some play time in scrims and minor tournaments
* That I would be provided a teacher for Chinese and Math
That all my travel costs to renew my Chinese visa would be paid for

After many iterations back and forth IG finally agreed to these changes, however when we went to sign, none of the agreed upon changes made it into the final contract. I immediately contacted Zhili, IG's COO and he guaranteed that it was a clerical mistake and that everything IG promised will hold even though the contract had been changed. He said that it would be too late to reprint and to trust his word on it. My mother in Australia signed the contract for me as I am still underage.

Fast forward a few weeks, Ferrari430 was suddenly back and IGV renamed to IG and IG renamed to IGV, I was told I could play mid for IGV (Paparazzi's stack) or sub for Ferrari430. It was a very tough decision, but I chose to stay with IG because IG promised me that even though I was a sub I would still get equal share of prize money and IG also promised that it would be the final year for Ferrari430 and that he was definitely retiring after TI regardless of result. Had I known what was about to happen to me I would have never chose to be benched for 4 months as a sub. 

After returning to the team Ferrari430 played very well in the NEA online qualifiers and helped IG secure LAN final in Beijing and then abruptly left the team. I was subbed in last minute and played only in the LAN finals but luckily we were able to secure the victory over Newbee.

Fast forward a few months and a lot has happened or should I say not happened. Ferrari430 came back to train for TI qualifiers and again I was benched. During my entire stay at IG, no attempt at getting me a Chinese tutor or translator was ever made, I was excluded from most team meetings because according to the management I did not understand Chinese, I was never compensated for costs related to renewing my Chinese visa. Overall the management of the team was very poor and there was little communication between management and myself.

Fast forward to the beginning of post TI shuffle, management didn't proactively let me know whether they had a spot on the team for me and whether Ferrari430 would stay or leave. In the end Tian and I had to wrestle the truth out of them, they did not want me on the main or IGV roster but said that they would make a third team for me. This sounded like a poor attempt at benching me again for a season since no players other than myself were confirmed for IG's 3rd team. Guess what? Its October and IG does not have a third roster.

Their excuse was that I could not communicate with the team when in actual fact my mother is Shanghainese and that makes me half Chinese and I understand all the dota2 terminology, items, heroes, skills how to coordinate in fights, I was also willing to learn.  The truth of the situation is that they were already in talks with bigger name players and they had time left on my contract and didn't know what to do with me. When we asked them who was on this supposed 3rd team of IG or even what the name was no information could be provided to us.

There are a lot of rumors on the Chinese forums that I left IG because I could not speak Chinese or eat Chinese food. That is all false, I can understand enough Chinese for pro dota and I love Chinese food, but I also enjoy western food. Is that a crime? 

I really wanted to continue playing with my boys in IG but management didnt let me. This is when Tian started negotiating my release from IG because they didn't have any real plans of having a third team, as far as I know I was going to be benched for another season. I would rather go back to school if I could not find a good team and was a sub doing nothing again. 

I was finally paid my winnings from NEA late September and it was 51,200 RMB out of a grand total of 800,000 RMB and the rest of the players were paid over 100,000 RMB. I am also yet to be paid for my DPL (over $2000 USD)  or G-League winnings (over $2000 USD). 

When we contacted IG regarding the discrepancy between what I was paid and what was promised they made excuses and eventually cut contact with us. They simply don't acknowledge that they promised me equal share of prize money even when presented with proof, VK (IG CEO) even went as far as belittling my manager for wanting more than I got and that it was a joke that we were even talking to him for so little money because he is such an important man. In the end VK (CEO), Zhili (COO) have all stopped replying messages from Tian and myself and I am short over $12,000 USD.

I am deeply sad that such a world renowned club would be ruined by such poor management. How many players have been ripped off by IG or other shady clubs? Will Ferrari430 ever receive his Ferrari promised to him by IG? Are promises worth nothing unless written in the form of a contract? 

Here are the transcripts (In Chinese) between Tian and IG.Zhili (IG COO) The transcripts are basically Zhili promising us equal share of prize money and when confronted with his own chat history he ignores us.

I don't see how I will ever get this 12k back and it is a lot of money for my family and I. I guess I am just really sad about this whole situation but I have learnt my lesson. Finally, I just want to make it clear that my beef is with IGs management and I have NOTHING against the players in IG, I made many friends there and I am grateful for that and still chat with them day to day. 

If on the off chance that Wang Sicong reads this post, please return to me what I am owed and stop letting bad management ruin IG.

**Comment from my manager: To those saying I should not have advised Ana to sign an altered contract. I recognise it was a risk however at that time it was a take it or leave it but if we take it IG promised us verbally the terms we wanted. It was still in Ana's best interest to take and sign the contract, as starting a career in a team was more important to Ana than money, this however does not take away from IG's wrong doing. Secondly according to Chinese law wechat chatlogs are absolutely admissible in event of contract dispute.**

Open letter to Valve: do not work with PGL again|self.DotA2|~Hi everyone. Im one of the talents from the Russian-language commentating studio at large Valve tournaments, and this is an open letter to them and to PGL. I dont find it necessary to introduce myself, as most of the viewpoints and opinions expressed in this letter are in no way my personal ones, but rather collective. The central message of this letter can be summed up as follows: Valve, please, take action and deal with PGL.

Now to specific points. I think it will be reasonable to split this letter into several segments dedicated to each of the Majors. That will be the best approach.

The Manila Major

Last season, Valve was actively testing various contractors, apparently in order to find the optimal one for cooperation on a permanent basis. That was how ESL got Frankfurt, PW got Shanghai, and PGL got Manila. At the time, it was PGLs first Dota tournament; the tournaments theyd organized previously were in other disciplines, which was why we were a little worried here: firstly, on account of the long traveling distance, and secondly, because the organizers might not have an entirely clear idea of what Dota was, what made it different from other disciplines, and what product the viewers would like to see. However, our doubts were gone almost the minute we began cooperating with them.

First, we were told that our plane tickets to the event venue were business class. This was a real gift to us, as business class is significantly more pleasant than economy when your flight takes half a day. I suppose its fairly obvious. Thus we traveled comfortably to the venue, were accommodated at Manilas best hotel, were treated to food, drinks and themed events such as Oktoberfest (although that was perhaps a disputable choice, seeing as Oktoberfest coincided with the last night before the playoffsbut it was there nonetheless), an American cuisine night, a Chinese one, etc. etc.

The organization of the tournament itself was also top-notch, and we were more than satisfied. The absence of delays or lengthy pauses, or communication issues between talents and organizers, made for an unforgettable tournament, the best of the three Majors in the 2015/16 season. 

I dont think theres a point in describing PGLs work at TI, as most of the work there was done by Valve and MCW events, while PGLs resources were focused specifically on the English-language livestream. Everyone was OK with thatPGL, Valve, and ourselves. This looks like a very positive letter so far, doesnt it? Well, not really. Problems would begin later.

The Boston Major

Valve cut its Majors budget for the 2016/17 season. Thus while during the debut season, the contractors had been given a blank check and could ask for however much money they needed, this time the budgets were fixed. Nevertheless, they were more than enough to create a comfortable environment for everyone while also turning a profit. Not as large as in the previous season, but a decent one too. However, PGL decided it should make just as much money, and went into saving mode. This is where it gets interesting.

Firstly, business class flights were out of the question nowwhich was indeed clear to everyone by that point. Were no superstars whod complain about something like thatalthough granted, it was something of a letdown to go back to economy having tasted all the perks and comfort of business class. There were, however, other and more serious issues.

Besides slashing the budget, this year Valve decided to test a system where analysts would work from home. 

Essentially, the experiment disappointed no-one. Many analysts said it was nice to not have to travel to the other side of the world when you could stay at home. Jetlag and acclimating are after all difficult things that everyone experiences in their own way.

However, introducing this practice created the need for an assistant contractor to help PGL set up analyst panel for the Russian broadcast and establish communication between commentators and analysts, in Boston and Moscow/Kiev respectively. As many of you know, there were only two obvious options here: to entrust this task to either Starladder or RuHub. PGL made up its mind and announced a bidding procedure for an assistant contractor. Bids were written up and sent to Romanians for consideration.

I was in touch with RuHub staff at the time, and they were a little worried, as they wanted very much to organize an event of this kind, while realizing that the head of PGL is a good friend of the head of Starladder. Thus there were misgivings, and they eventually proved not unfounded.

A few weeks after the consideration (the reason for the quotes will become clear later), PGL wrote a letter to RuHub saying they had chosen Starladder as the contractor. 
During that time, Valve was deciding on a list of commentators, analysts, and the presenter who were to take part in the event. The list was made, and invitations were sent out to commentators. Sent out isnt perhaps the right term. MCW Events, who were in charge of travel, accommodation and other things related to commentators, asked them to fill in requests which could be used to book plane tickets, hotels, etc.

The personalities who were to be involved in the analyst panel received nothing. A few days after PGLs choice in favor of Starladder, a Starladder employee contacted Goblak, XBOCT, PGG, NS, and Faker, the folks Valve had decided to invite for covering the tournament. Each of them got a different wording. Some were addressed in an official style; with others, the format was Hiya, you are from Kiev arent you, so I suppose you wont need accommodation? To say those people were surprised would be an extreme understatement. For instance, Goblak, who wasnt an employee of either RuHub or Starladder, might have no idea what they were even talking about.

Everyone unanimously declined to participate. The following day, a group chat was set up on Skype with a certain Silvio, who was one of the top people at PGL (or the top person, Im not sure). The chat included all the people whod declined to participate, Silvio, and a Starladder employee. Silvio introduced himself, said that Starladder had been chosen as the contractor, and that the people were invited to work on December 211. Any questions? was the last sentence of that message. It sounded as if decisions had already been made and no-one had a choice. This is hardly how an official invitation to a tournament ought to look like. Over the course of the following hour, the same thing happened all over again: all the analysts and the presenter declined to participate. OK, Silvio wrote, and the conversation ended.

That same evening, it turned out Valve had been entirely out of the loop on the bidding prodecure and PGLs choice of Starladder. This is not to complain about Valve, who had after all handed over the organization of the tournament to other people. Nonetheless, the matter was investigated, as it was in no-ones best interest to leave viewers without analysis at an official livestream. In a conversation, RuHub found out that the bid had actually never existed. The bids had been a pure formality, and PGL had ALREADY handed over the organization of the analyst panel at the point when RuHub had only just sent their bid inStarladder hadnt even written theirs. The absurdity of the situation was at its peak.

Valves decision was to give the livestream to RuHub, which PGL had no choice but to accept. The viewers won out, as besides the invited analysts, it was now possible to get together a full-fledged analyst panel in Moscow. RuHub provided the money that was paid to the unofficial analysts. In total, RuHub took pretty much money out of its own pocket, even though setting up the Russian stream was initially supposed to be funded by PGL. With the amount theyd provided, however, if not a penny had been spent on RuHubs part, the analysts wouldve been sitting on stools in front of a coffee table with an old Soviet portable TV set to watch the matches on.

Speaking of money, PGL naturally decided to cut the salaries too. Compared to Manila, where everyone was paid what we can designate as 1.3k gold, the Boston salary was 1.0k gold for everyone, with no distinctions. Moreover, people would only find out how much they were paid upon checking their bank accounts a month after the tournament. Meaning that PGL didnt have a definitive notion of a salary in mind. Not as far as Russian talents were concerned, anyway. English speakers always engage in personal dialog with the organizers and negotiate their salaries themselves. For instance, the absolute top-tier commentators and analysts can earn 4k gold for a tournament; for talents in a league below them, the figure is 23k gold; and for the presenter, 56k. In a handful of cases, with the young and inexperienced, the organizers are able to pull off paying what they pay the Russian speakers. The organizers didnt want to discuss the issue of salaries with our representatives; they werent interested.

It was time for the tournament to begin. Out of the entire coverage staff, 6 commentators traveled to it at PGLs expense (Lex had been refused a visa), along with 3 or 4 tech people, and that was it. Whereas earlier, any organizer would provide the budget for a content maker and a cameraperson, this time, the suggestion was to bring them along at ones own expense, or not at all. Doesnt that sound like a good idea.

Upon arriving at the tournament, the commentators and players began to feel the austerity. You only get food if you work/play on that particular day is a really strange formula. And while an organization like EG might not particularly care who paid for their lunch, it could be a problem for teams without an organization or sponsor. Thankfully, the commentators did work every day, so they got food every day too. Its quality, however, left something to be desired. There were other small organizational nuisances, but they werent critical and its hard to remember most of them by now. 

The Kiev Major

You might think those were the juiciest and most interesting bits of this letter, but wait, theres more. Quite likely, if the Kiev tournament had gone well, this letter wouldnt have had to be written in the first place. This time, however, the organizers went even further. 

People started getting invitations to the tournament at the end of March. A new system was introduced. Besides the main invites, there was a list of backup commentators and analysts: those who would be invited if some of the core ones were for some reason unable to go to the tournament. People began to wonder what Valves selection principles even were.

There was information that Valve put a certain committee in charge of selecting people for large tournaments. Said committee consists of a certain number of people who assess the quality and working style of various personalities, and come up with a list of required invitations based on their own judgement. Here another question arises: who selected the committee members themselves, and on what basis? No names are provided, for no apparent reason. That is to say, there is of course one obvious reason, and thats to prevent any attempts at influencing these people to get them to pick personalities that would otherwise not have been invited. But there are two sides to this coin. A member of the committee may also be inherently biased against a specific person and be a factor in their absence from tournaments. 

In and of itself, putting a group of people together is a very good idea, since it immediately precludes any bribery on the part of competing organizations. However, in order that the group itself doesnt raise any questions, their identities ought to be disclosed and an explanation provided as to what merits and/or accomplishments earned these particular people the honor of assessing the work of talents. 

Another problem with the issuing of invites was their quantity. An odd number of commentators and an odd number of analysts made planning our work and schedules complicated. Im going to skip ahead here and show you an ordinary example: here we have 7 invited commentators (with 4 parallel livestreams during the group stage), and 5 analysts (so theres no sensible way to split them into shifts). What was the problem with inviting one more commentator and one more analyst? We never got an answer to that question. The funniest thing about it all was that the number of people invited to the home major was one-and-a-half times smaller than the number of talents at the English-language studio. And while that system hadnt raised too many questions before, this time the decision was quite baffling. 

But enough about invites already. They invited who they invited, even if it did cause a number of problems. After the invites were issued, discussions began between PGL and the Russian-language talents concerning payment and everything else. Shouldnt the very fact that an inviter doesnt bring a specific salary offer to the table, raise some eyebrows in 2017? It certainly raised ours.

v1lat was chosen to speak on behalf of the Russian-language talents, as there was no point in discussing it all individually. We were on friendly terms with each other and wanted to present a united front rather than be disparate voices. For the first few weeks, PGL was evasive, didnt name any sums and was generally trying to avoid clearly answering the remuneration question. Finally, they said everyone would have the same salary as in Boston (1,000 gold), regardless of their workload. In the meantime, the English-language talents were each discussing their salaries individually, and there was talk of the organizers paying certain personalities 500 gold per work day + 300 gold for flight days, adding up to about 4,000/5,000.

A situation like that suited pretty much no-one. Firstly, working in the hall is a bit of a different story from sitting back and just working for the internet. When you see people behind your back, when youre in the same room with them, you cant help feeling that much more nervous. 

Meanwhile, an option discussed with v1lat was for him to not be a commentator at the tournament at all, but instead, to be the presenter, interviewer, and interpreter for the official Russian livestream. The discussion got stuck as Vitaly didnt want to do that, and PGL forgot about that conversation. However, the topic of money continued to be discussed. PGL were actively insisting, This is all the budget youve got, there wont be any more money. The talents started to get annoyed; PGLs indifference was stupefying for many. A week before the official announcement, the Romanians simply ceased all communication with the Russian-language talents, ignoring them completely. Nice business tactic there, present them with a fait accompli and then just ignore them. Many considered pulling out of the tournament. Perhaps if that decision had been made, wed have been able to break PGL. But this being a domestic Major who everyone, with no exceptions, wanted to work at, the pressure was much too strong for us to be able to gather our willpower and walk out. In the end, PGLs tactic worked. While they were ignoring our folks, and we for our part couldnt reach a consensus, the official announcement was made, and there was nothing more to be done. PGL had won.
 
People stopped thinking about money; the important thing was after all to make sure the domestic Major goes well, to prove that the CIS deserved to see a return of Valves tournaments in the seasons to come. A few days before the tournament, the talents from Russia found out that thered be no invites from the organizers, i.e. PGL didnt care at all whether people would get to Kiev or not, it just wasnt their concern. Visas are another matter, where no-one is protected from a potential refusal. But people have always been getting invitations. Here, however, the approach was sort it out on your own. Its very fortunate that RuHub and Starladder are based in Kiev, as it was they who sent the invitation to the Russians. However, PGLs indifference started to get positively irritating at that point.

The talents from Russia were scheduled to arrive on April 20. And accommodated at a $400-a-night hotel. Yet again, one is left wondering: whats the point of bringing people in four days in advance, when they could arrive a day or two before the tournament (the Kiev/Moscow difference is indeed greater than, say, the Moscow/Seattle one) and bring in another person with the money saved (13 x 400 x 2 = $10,400). In the end, they didnt have to book a hotel for the Kiev folks (v1lat, Faker, GodHunt and Goblak), and that would have given them the money to bring in another person or even two. Yet PGL has a certain problem reasoning logically. 

After everyone arrived and was accommodated, the Romanians decided to have a private conversation with v1lat so that an earlier, unfinished chat on Skype could be brought to a meaningful conclusion. In the course of that meeting, it turned out PGL had FORGOTTEN that a tournament required a presenter on stage, an interviewer and an interpreter. No big deal, you know, just the main organizer of a tournament forgetting to invite three extra people, happens all the time. Vitaly was told the following: Its your crowd, and frankly, we dont care what youre going to do. Have the interviews interpreted if you wish, or dont. This is your business, its got nothing to do with us. I suppose it goes without saying that Vitaly was not going to get any additional payment for taking charge of these tasks.

Naturally, Vitaly wasnt satisfied with this arrangement, and refused it (although he did act as an interpreter in the end). Salary raises continued to be discussed that same evening. PGL only agreed to give some extra coin (1,200 gold instead of 1,000) to a single person: Faker, the main host. The following explanation was provided: We took a look at the schedule and didnt expect there to be so much work. Towards the end of the tournament, theyd go back on their promise and say hed be getting as much as the others, seeing as there was no budget for anything else after allhence 1,000, and thats the end of that.
A new catering strategy was also tested at the tournament: people ordered food from restaurants with MCW Events twice a day, and the latter was in charge of delivery. I dont want to go into detail on that situation, but long story short, half of the orders took 4 hours to be delivered, some werent delivered at all, some people had their orders mixed up, etc. Overall, no-one was surprised, as that system had looked flawed from the outset.

It was tournament time. The English broadcasters were working from Romania, and the Russian ones, from the CyberArena in Kiev. First game; everythings fine. Except the English stream had live reporting with cameras at the hotel, and the Russian one didnt. Why not? Because the Romanians had forgotten there was a Russian stream. Thankfully, the head producer of the Russian broadcast took to flooding the Romanians inboxes until, starting from the second game, the live reports were there. 

Also people might have noticed that the look of the Russian stream was quite different from what PGL was showing. The problem was that the tournaments chief organizer was acting as if they were exclusively a contractor of the English stream and no-one else. For this reason, plans concerning the content of the English stream were never put forward. 

But that wasnt the problem. Our analysts biggest complaint was the absence of ordinary laptops. This was something that had never been seen at a tournament before. Of late, folks had stopped bringing their own laptops, seeing as organizers often ask not to put them in shot, since some models would not fit in and would ruin the visual cohesion, etc. That was why there were no personal laptops at the tournament. Neither, however, had any been provided by the organizers. And that problem wasnt dealt with before the end of the tournament, even though there were some hopes. The absence of laptops adversely affected the quality of analysts work, as they had to analyze matches based solely on what the observer was showing, and nothing else.
 
The group stage trudged to its conclusion; streams were on for 15 hours a day, but everyone was preparing for the playoffs, so there werent any particularly strong misgivings. Everybody wanted to focus their attention on what was the main event of the year for the CIS. 

The plan for the analysis room was to make it very impressive-looking and swanky. But then on the night before the broadcast, the table that was supposed to be inside it broke, so we had to fetch the one from the CyberArena. No-one went into details on how and why it had broken, but it already was a bit of a disappointment. Later, there was information that the broken table story was made up, and thered been no table to begin with. That information, however, is an unconfirmed rumor, so well leave it at that. There were also no laptops, but you could already see that on our streams. 

The following directions came from the Romanians during the playoff stage: Anyone who wasnt officially invited to cover this tournament CANNOT take part in activities. Youve seen live segments with Dendi, XBOCT, ArtStyle, Resolut1on, and Fly. That was initially forbidden. PGL itself stopped bothering about its own rule on the second day of the playoffs, and we made use of the opportunity. Aside from that, the credit for what did go on the streamwhat there was of itshould go to the talents and the Russian production team. PGL was entirely fine with just having an analysis, match, analysis type of broadcast, without any video content if need be. 

All of the camera people, editors, interviewers and others worked pro bono here; they received no payment for their work. And, most importantly, PGL had complaints even there. In the CyberKiev video where v1lat was sitting on the CyberArena stage talking about the history of Dota and the Kiev esports scene, the Romanians spotted a half-covered Blizzard logo behind his back. Notably, Valve wasnt particularly bothered about it, while PGL simply couldnt live it down. Here we see them no longer completely unconcerned about what was going on the Russian stream. They simply sought to complicate things for everyone, and they were willing to use any petty pretext for that. 

There was a clear problem with the schedule and match times. Playing would go on for 16 hours, partially due to large pauses between individual games and the series themselves. However, on the third day, PGL shortened the airtime of various interview at its own discretion, so games now took a little less time to begin. Nevertheless, it did not crucially affect the schedule, as the third matchday still finished long past midnight. However, the organizers showed understanding in responding to this situation (their only appropriate response during the tournament), and thus they allowed the analysis panel to finish working earlier and get at least 56 hours of sleep (here we ought to point out that these people woke up an hour and a half before going live, and went to bed half an hour after broadcasting ended). 

The problem of PGLs indifference to the Russian-language talents manifested itself in every kind of small details. For example, on the first day, the talents asked for juice to be added to the selection of drinks, where Red Bulls and sodas were on offer. PGL ignored that request for two days. At the tournament itself, there were several Valve representatives, and when on the third day the talent asked the same of Valve, juice and ice tea were available at the canteen a mere hour later. A small but very telling detail. 

As workers, we were left with an ambivalent feeling after the tournament. The home crowd had certainly saved the event; everybody was pleased to work for their own audience, and gave it their best. But many of us strongly resented PGLs indifference and complete lack of interest in delivering a good product to the local audience. Were anything but spoilt, but none of us had ever encountered an attitude like that at a Valve tournament. It was this indifference, this couldnt-care-less mindset, that led me to write this letter.

Id like to end my letter on the same note I started it with. Dear Valve, please make sense of this situation and conduct your own investigation. The Russian-language talents and production staff are at the end of their strength and willingness to work with PGL on any future event. I hope you will take steps and well once again be able to bring joy and positivity that will not only be characteristic of our work, but also felt by us when we arent facing the cameras. 
For their part, readers and ordinary viewers will probably be able to draw a lot of interesting information from all thats been written here.
To summarize, lets go through the main points of this letter:

1.  The Manila Major was fantastic; we were endeared by the comfortable working environment the organizers had created.
2.  Ahead of Boston, Valve implements a new system of studio operation, with on-site commentators and stay-at-home analysis panels. There is a need for an additional contractor for the analysis panel.
3.  PGL announces a bidding procedure, but makes its own choice in favor of Starladder even before the deadline for the bids, as the head of PGL is good friends with the head of Starladder.
4.  Valve finds out about this manipulation and hands organizing Boston over to RuHub. Meanwhile, the budget PGL was supposed to provide for setting up the studio is virtually nonexistent, and RuHub spends a big amount of money out of its own pocket.
5.  Information appears ahead of The Kiev Major about a talent-selecting committee whose members names are not disclosed. Its never established who these people are and what gives weight to their votes. 
6.  PGL present everyone with their invitations as a fait accompli, without any mention of salaries. Over the two weeks that follow, the Romanians dodge the question, and then say the pay will be the same as in Boston; when an attempt is made to discuss a raise, they cite a limited budget and begin to ignore all attempts at contact.
7.  Kiev Major becomes the first tournament whose organizers refuse to send invitations to talents and say it isnt their problem.
8.  After everyone has gathered in Kiev, PGL organize a meeting with Vilat, at which they mention in conversation that they are completely indifferent to what happens on the Russian stream, whether it will have translations of interviews, live reporting, or anything else. This is not the concern of the tournaments chief organizer. 
9.  Every request made during the course of the tournament, even a small one, is completely ignored by PGL. Meanwhile, Valve staff present at the same event resolve the same issues in minutes. 
10.  PGLs indifference to Russian coverage is haunting people throughout the event. Instead of the tournaments chief organizer, PGL look like a contractor of the English stream.

WESG wants to deduct my team's winnings, telling my team and I to pay for 5 return airtickets amounting to 1700USD|self.DotA2|~This is my very first time on Reddit. Many friends and gamers told me i could post here and seek for advice and help. I thought about it, and its really unpleasant to make a post here as the tournament is still going on (Finals in March 2018). However, i would like to reach out to all managers and players to be very careful with booking of their air tickets and I sincerely do not want this to happen to another team and their players. (Please bear with my bad English, and correct me as I go along, Thank you)

Our Team Kazakhstan won first in their qualifiers and therefore attained tickets and a slot at the regional APAC finals at WESG. Visas were so difficult to get approved from the China Embassy, whether individual or group visa. As for individual visas, I had tried to request for "barcodes" from Alisports for instant approval, but after waiting for 3 weeks, Alisports told me its not possible to get barcodes anymore, and told me to find other ways to attain our visas. I then told my players to get group visas, which needed a lot of documents (for example, bank statements, and police statements, and many more).
One of my team player was located at another far end of Kazakhstan, and he flew to the main city to try and get his individual visa done but to no avail, as there are only 2 Chinese Embassies in Kazakhstan, and the one he flew to, do not issue individual visas without barcodes.

Monday, 8th January was our proposed starting date of WESG lan. We are instructed to be there at 8th January to report at the hotels. And we only attained our group visas at 5th January (worth 420 USD), and I asked for 2 way tickets, routing from Kazakhstan to China (back and forth), I even drafted a route with all my 5 players domestic flights and told the interpreter to book the flights proposed. I received a proposed flight plan back, and it was not as i stated in the email, but because all the flights that was in the proposal could bring my players back to their respective cities, i said yes, and told them to hurry with the ordering of tickets. 
Some domestic flights started at Sunday morning, and All my players had to fly to Almaty, Kazakhstan, then take a flight together to Beijing. And i will meet them in Beijing via a flight from Singapore. And then 6 of us will take the same flight from Beijing to Qingdao (WESG lan). Many times i asked the interpreter to put me on the same flight with them from Beijing, but apparently (later i found out) she did not convey this message to the tour agency, and just told me "its not possible". I received the tickets all on Saturday morning, and i paid 80 USD from my own pocket to get the flight changed, so i can meet my players and fly with them together to qingdao. 
 
Food was mentioned to be provided for all days throughout WESG, but it was not the case for the first day (and also last day of WESG) when we arrived. Many teams were shocked that food was not provided on first day, but we were all excited and did not really bother about it. Organisers told us that because they were not able to estimate the number of teams that would arrive on the first day, and therefore did not order food for us on first day. 
Anyways, this is not the main issue, WESG APAC was completed successfully, and the event was a blast. All players enjoyed themselves in that one week and we all had flights back to our countries on 15th January. We won 3rd place at the event by the way.

15th January Monday itself, i paid again out from my pocket to fly back to Singapore via Shenzhen, to my family business lodging at a later time, because WESG gave me tickets that were so early in the morning at 0755am, and this means i had to leave my players alone in China all the way until 2200Hrs at night where they will have their domestic flight from Qingdao to Beijing. I ve never really planned to leave them alone, so ive changed my tickets to depart at 1800hrs instead. We were notified to check out of hotel rooms at 12noon, but i paid for the room to be extended until 1800hrs, (like some other managers did the same as well) for the safety and comfort of our players.

My team went from Qingdao to Beijing, reaching Beijing at midnight. Then a problem arised that they were not able to have boarding passes for their respective flights as they were on group visas, and they need to leave China together via the same flight. 3 boys leave on one flight from Beijing to Astana at about 2:30am, and the other 2 boys will leave from Beijing to Almaty at 5:55am. The Beijing airport requires all domestic flights passengers to check out of the airport and to check in again with baggage, and they do not have ample time to wait for answers and confirmation and thus they missed the very first flight to astana. So team leader tried to contact me via public phone calling to my Singapore number but i did not notice the calls until about 630am, and team leader told me that they needed group airtickets. 
I frantically called WESG organisers, and asked them for help, they were fast on helping me, and tickets were booked for them, however, they needed to stay in the airport for one more entire day as the flights were early morning at 5:55am as a group this time. Throughout the time, i attained the contact of the tour agency lady, AA . who initially booked the tickets and she was in doubt about who was paying for the new tickets. 
Alisports then dropped the bomb on me saying they will deduct the air tickets from our prize winnings.

Its now 24th Jan, and I am still disputing this 1700 USD. They insisted that we should shoulder this amount as we confirmed the tickets before we took our flights to China.
I wrote an email (i cut the email short here) to dispute the airticket charges, stating these points, with picture evidences and screen shots of our convos and emails.

"1) Team Manager already informed interpreter XX, about 5 times during conversation, that our team booked group visa. It was proven to XX via emails, and via wechat convos. 

2) Team Manager do not have direct contact communication with Ms AA (tour agency lady), and when Manager asked Ms AA whether she was informed about the group visas, Ms AA claimed she was not informed at all about this important and crucial information. If she had known we had group visas, She would book return tickets as a group from Beijing into Kazakhstan because of her profession as a tour agency agent, she knows about this visa rule. 

3) Manager asked for 2 way tickets for the trips and also stated in the email that they are travelling on group visas, (5 times mentioned to interpreter, XX), when the tour agency gave us the draft copy, we readily respected the wishes of the tour agency because we trusted WESG to be informed of our travelling documents and visas, as we are only players/team and we do not have knowledge about ticketing terms and conditions. 

4) Terms and conditions of the tickets were not known to us when WESG purchased the tickets. We were not aware that group visas required us to have the same exact tickets when travelling out of Beijing. 

This email dispute is not to blame, not to find fault and not to be critical against our interpreter, but if words and messages are not conveyed in the proper manner, or there is communication breakdown because of a middle man, Then maybe WESG committee can see the loopholes and we all can improve on our errors and mistakes. 
if you need further proof, I can attach it via email for u. Please let me know if you need it, because i am giving the interpreter the benefit of the doubt, that she will say the truth with me. 

Please kindly understand our positions, and we came to China, empty handed. I hope our prize money can help our family and the bad gaming conditions at home and make us be a better team for March finals. 

Many thanks and Best regards,
Manager of Team Kazakhstan. "   

Today, 24th Jan, the director of Alisports Esports committee called me,  and told me that the final decision has not been made yet. And alisports Still wants me to cover the cost of the air tickets. 
I am hereby desperate, and i am seeking fellow gaming community to give me advice and help on how to resolve this situation. We are only participants of this event, if we did not win this 10k USD, would Alisports help us with the booking of return tickets? one nice guy from alisports said yes, but now, i would like to tell all teams, with managers or without, that if you guys have group visas, it is required for you to enter and also leave the participating country together as a group. No one but the travel agencies knows about this visa rule, and yet this information was not passed to her.... The director told me this has never happened in the history of WESG. =( 
Help me please. I think i really need help this time. 

Thank you for patience. 
Love,
Moon, Manager for Team Kazakhstan~|complaint esports

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Seriously though, if mods removed Nara's post because it was attacking her, why do they keep the posts that attacked CCNC, personalities and other pro players ?


Edit1: for the peoole asking what happened it appears that Nara used other people photos as her's, a thread pointing that for removed by the mods as to protect her and claiming that its not related to dota. But the same mods left hundreds of threads bashing and attacking CCnC.

Edit2: for the peoole saying it isn't related [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/6w6612/_/dm5mgtv)

Edit3: speaking of dota related [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/6w6612/_/dm5mvdm), I'm not trying to attack Redeye or 2GD by giving this example....

Edit7: to the people who are saying I posted this for the karma or for the drama, well to bad because that's not the reason. And to be clear I never watched or followed Nara on anything, so I'm not mad because " i gave her money because she's a cute grillll Haha". I posted this to say a couple of things:

1- I don't mind guess the hero posts or twitch clips or EE fails, I just want the unnecessary attack on any dota personality to stop.

2- the mods (or the mod) shouldn't have removed the original post from the beginning, as it made people confused about what happened.

Valve, this compendium sucked ass.|self.DotA2|~I've purchased every compendium since TI3, and always did so as a way to keep tabs on the tournament. The first iteration of the compendium had so many awesome interactive features, like predictions on every stage of the tournament, selecting your favorite player/team, collecting player trading cards, etc. 

I bought the Frankfurt Major compendium expecting at least some of those features. Player profiles, or main event predictions or something. And every week I've thought, "oh maybe they'll add it in today!", but nope. This compendium has nothing to do with frankfurt. My money didn't go into the prize pool, there's no interaction with the tournament. It's just a shitty bundle of items, wrapped in a shitty betting system, wrapped under the guise of digital sports. 

Will not be buying the next one, and if I could, I'd get refund on this one. ~|complaint esports

gg.bet, the major sponsor of Team NP, Empire, and Ad Finem has terms and conditions which allow them to blatantly scam unwitting users, and the community deserves to know|self.DotA2|~So a few days I go I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Betting/comments/5hjuda/started_using_ggbet_is_this_typical_policy_for/) asking if it was normal for betting sites to have heavy preventions on when you can withdraw your funds.

It seemed strange to me, but I blamed my naivety for assuming these websites were legit. Honestly, I was swayed by the site being a major sponsor of a few teams, as I figured it was more likely that a legitimate business would have the money to spare for marketing like that.

All I wanted to do was play around with $50 watching the Boston Major. I figured I enjoy watching Dota games anyway, I would pay to have a little extra thrill in each game with something personal at stake. So I go onto the most common site I see advertised, gg.bet, and see that there are multiple promo codes being shown to encourage new users to make a deposit. I don't know if I'm alone on this, but **I never assumed that I would have to read the T&Cs to understand that by accepting any bonus money, I practically eliminate my chances of ever getting any money back**. Unfortunately, that is the reality.

When I made similar posts as earlier on /r/Dota2Betting, I got talking to some other members and found out that this is **NOT** normal for betting sites to do.

/u/Patnor explained it best in this comment on /r/Dota2Betting:

> ok i wrote a long answer and i just deleted it after reading their bonus rules.

>GG.bet is a scam, there is nothing else to say about the matter. And judging by how they have obviously just googled big words to sound more serious, while infact they are just making an ass of themselves shows that its most likely some shady person behind the site.

>However.
> You have accepted their Bonus, which gives you 100% bonus deposit. This is the main rule thats keeping you from Withdrawing the money from your account.

>**You have to earn 25 times the amount of your deposit bonus.** Which means if you deposited 100$ you get 200$ and you have to earn a grand wopping 5000$ before you complete the bonus.
And no im not done yet. **You have to do this within 30 days of you activating the bonus**.

>This is a rookie mistake everyone has made to be honest, if you are new and you see a bonus its easy to think "free money if i win" But very few actually goes through their Requirements to actually pass the bonus as a whole.

>Also if you were to be lucky to win over 150$ with a freebet or anything you would lose every cent over 150$ which is kinda hilarious and extremely shady to have for any bookie that wants to be taken as a serious company.

>TLDR; You accepted bonus, you now have to earn 5000$ in 30 days to complete bonus and being able to Withdraw the money. Cut your losses, delete the account and simply keep away from shady sites like that.

>https://gyazo.com/77eb050ebbbf6a7a3e7a8d90513de23e

On top of this, you can't even win it on ez bets with low-risk odds. It doesn't even count unless the odds are at least 1.75!

Initially, I put $50 in to the account. The bonus code allowed me to double that, then another code gave me another $12. So I had $112. I have made various bets, winning all of them except for 1. Logically speaking, if the site first uses my bonus money, it should return bonus money **and leave my 'real money' untouched**. If it uses real money, **it should return real money**. Instead, gg.bet gives you bonus money and then effectively turns all your money into 'bonus money' that **you will never get back**. Unfortunately, this was all in the terms and conditions, but I neglected to read it. Yes, this is my fault, but that does not change the case that the website completely misleads its users. At best, this practice is shady. At worst, this practice is a total scam.

I spoke to support reps on their website's 24/7 live support. Once I tried my best to comprehend the broken english, they confirmed that I could not withdraw any money, basically ever. I then escalated this to a higher level of support and am still waiting for an email back almost a week later. It also asked if I wanted to save the chat logs, but I never got an email with them in there? To make things even more confusing, the bars shown in [this image of my account](http://i.imgur.com/SqsCPlV.png) count to 1250 and the other one used to count 300 but has since disappeared from the site entirely. The default is 1250, and I've earnt 40 of that. I suspect this means the amount of money I have bet on something with odds over 1.75 is $40, meaning I have to *bet* (NOT WIN) $1250 ONLY ON ODDS OF 1.75 OR MORE in order to get a cent back from the website. **On the third of January, all of that money will just expire**. 

I have emailed the site twice now asking for my initial deposit back. My initial deposit was $50, then my total balance from bonuses was $112. My current balance is $159.50. Though I am rightfully owed my winnings from my bet on EG vs VP, I will settle purely for getting my initial deposit back since I am yet to lose it. Here is an [imgur album](http://imgur.com/gallery/L3WKX) showing the screenshots of my account for verification of all of this.

Has anyone else had any experiences with this? Since their support won't talk to me, all I can do is dissuade anyone else from using their awful service and getting scammed like I have been. After looking into it a bit more, it seems that Pinnacle is the best place for betting on e-sports, though honestly I think this whole thing has turned me off the idea entirely.

**Edit 1:**  damn, the reading comprehension of some people is poor. This is more of a PSA than a whine. I understand that this is my own fault for not being careful with my money, however I think my mistake is one that a lot of people would make and this post is meant to serve as a warning and deterrent from these sites. People keep saying "this is normal". *Having to bet and win 25x your initial deposit on odds of 1.75+ all within 30 days is absolutely not normal*, and is extremely scummy. Another point that people seem to be missing is my main complaint, that by accepting the bonus money **my real money is effectively rendered completely void**. All I'm doing is raising awareness for suckers like myself that might be exploited, and for teams to hopefully stop advertising this service. Teams absolutely have a responsibility to advertise decent companies, consider the uproar when Navi sponsored an MMR booster on twitch. This is far worse, this company effectively steals from its users. NP, Empire and AF are helping this shitty company exploit their fans. The site also advertises [Fnatic a lot too so it seems that there are a huge number of esports teams that advertise for this company.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/5ic29z/_/db7fvcl)

**Edit 2:** I forgot to highlight another incredibly shady aspect of their T&Cs. IF you manage to meet their crazy requirements for a withdrawal, in my case $1250, **I can only actually have $150 of that**. How can anyone defend this? 

**Edit 3:** everyone saying issue a chargeback. I guess this must be more common in USA with your weirdly lenient refund policies but how would I go about doing this in Australia? I chose to spend this money, I don't think my bank will just let me turn around and decide I want the money back now. 

**Edit 4:** I just called my bank and told them and they said they'd get back to me, so here's hoping. In the mean time, /u/herro9n has done [some awesome investigatory work](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5iep9a/further_information_on_ggbet_and_their_shady/db7nzwa/) and found that gg.bet is just one of many fronts for a huge network of similarly shady gambling websites. Basically, this isn't just one dude sitting behind his computer getting free cash, this is a massive operation with many different websites, all of which have similarly shady issues with customers wanting to withdraw money. I also just tweeted the teams mentioned to see what they think of this.

**tl;dr** using promotional codes on gg.bet allows them to turn your real money into "bonus money" which is designed in such a way that you will never get it back.~|complaint

What i care is the removal of the HP number on the hero, that is a gamebreaking thing for me. Me, many people and even pros rely on those numbers.  The HP number over the HP bar was something centered, the only thing that the eye could never miss.    

Valve need to understand that many people don't rely on the HP bar + HP numbers on the HUD, but rely on HP bar+ HP numbers on the hero.   
  
Valve can still add whatever they want to facilitate the gameplay to new users, until these things do not destroy the gameplay for the "old users".

What happened Valve seriously? It's like we're in a Beta...|self.DotA2|~* Server Quality is at an all time low
* Items don't drop anymore / Horrible new drop system
* Trading of items in non existent and the economy is near death compared to games like CS:GO
* Cosmetics are getting approved that make Alpine Ursa look like a really good idea
* Levels have no meaning or purpose 
* Features getting cut left and right with the recent "override_vpk" patch
* Tons of features in the game that sit there doing nothing like we're in some sort of beta
* Gems, BP booster slots, levels, "best played hero" basically most played, commendations are also there just for well nothing, Recruitment level also literally useless, no new taunts, no new music packs, crafting system scraped or useless
* Kill by screen still doesn't show anything cool or worth of noting at least let us display an item for the hero that we want to be displayed or some message or something, you also can't hide it it just sits there being in the way...
* Still no useful or fun trophies or achievements 
* Guild system, Team System, Fantasy Leauges

It honestly feels like we're still in a Beta with so many features and thing begin cut in the last 6 months and not removed just left there standing doing nothing. It's like a messy room where no one bothers to clean up anything and that stale Pizza just sits on the table for 4 weeks until it start to stink or gets in the way... If it doesn't it just sits there for months! 

Now inb4 I'm an entitled asshole that hasn't payed for the game. I sunk more money then I'd like to admit. Probably over 200 over the last 3 years. And thats huge by Croatian Student standards... 

I mean seriously whats happening? While the meta game and the game itself are pretty good and fun right now. Every other feature thats we're basically "paying" for is broken one way or another. 

New players are especially fucked from a "fun" and "progress" sort of perspective. I used to look forward to every new level, every new chest opening, every new god damn 1 piece of equipment so I could go and try to complete it via trade. I felt like I'm progressing, doing something. I've seen my inventory go from 1 page to 15 pages. Hell I even needed 2 expansions. And now for the last what half a year... nothing.

International Ranked Top Player|self.DotA2|~The International Ranked top player for the season is some dude named Cr33py (last time i checked) and he has over 8k mmr. I checked his dota profile to see what heroes they've been playing and how many matches, etc. 

I discovered that most if not all of his recent games have only been about 7 minutes long, nobody on either team has any items(with the exception of one person in most matches I looked at), eacg member of his team has gold in the thousands, and there are many downvotes and angry comment on the matches. This guy is exploiting some kind of bug or something to get to 8k so he can swap mmr by the time International Ranked is over. What can be done?

Team Secret Pay Your Players.|self.DotA2|~So a week has gone by since EE's blog and Team Secret's "response" is insulting to say the least. No apology, no acknowledgement of the issue, just as EE said it: "empty words.". So does this mean Misery, EE, W33 and the rest are never going to get paid for their hard work? You're just going to let it slide and hope nobody notices? Well I hope to bring this back to the forefront once again so you can finally own up to your mistakes, and show concrete steps being taken to remedy the situation. This blatant abuse of talent cannot go unpunished nor can it become the norm. It's time to finally own up and pay your players Team Secret.

I thought Team Secret was an organization created by the players, for the players? Everything Team Secret has done to this point is antithetical to that ideal. It's time this organization examine itself from top to bottom to analyze and figure out just why this team has failed to live up to that standard. The statement put out by the team just shows just how flawed and out of touch the organization really is with the gravity of the situation. This is a symptom of an even greater problem within the organization. 

Please Puppey, if you have any respect for the team you helped create two years ago, you will stop running from the problem, and make your team the organization you wanted it to be. You felt screwed over by Na'Vi, but now your team is starting to morph into something even worse. I know it's hard to be called out by ex-teammates, but the best thing you can do to show them any respect is to give them the decency of a simple acknowledgement of the problem. Show them the steps being taken to make any outstanding payments, and current players how payments are going to be distributed in the future. It is the least you could do. Running from the problem isn't going to fix anything, and it's only going to get worse the longer you refuse to acknowledge the problem. 

I've been a fan of Puppey since TI2, and Team Secret when it was formed after TI4. It pains me to see an organization I loved descend into "this". If you have it in your hearts to make it up to your players and fans, you will fix this problem, and you will provide a REAL response, not some bullshit statement to placate sponsors in a time of crisis.~|complaint esports

Diablo 2 in Dota 2 is officially cancelled. Valve doesn't care about custom games. This patch broke them again.|self.DotA2|~Hey guys, you might remember me from these posts

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6uc841/diablo_2_in_dota_2_needs_your_help/

https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7jvwwp/how_valve_completely_destroyed_custom_games_with/

So, after my first post, Valve gave us the Custom game contest. Read all about that in the second thread.

Now, a while has gone by from that thread, and Valve has done literally nothing. I know that most of that time included the holiday break, but come on it takes less then 10 minutes to send an email.

Today, a patch dropped, which did some great things as   

* Most custom games on dedicated servers now crash instantly when loading in   
* Outside of dedicated servers, my RPG just crashes instantly when you select a hero   
* Forcing a hero selection, the quest system and inventory system are fucked. Probably will have to rewrite if I care. These systems took me over a year to make.   
* Games that are lucky and dont crash like EBF or roshpit champions- Projectiles and all dummy units have healthbars and are vulnerable. Yep, you can kill projectiles with auto attacks now. Invulnerability, disabling health bar, and a ton of shit just doesn't work anymore.   

And today's patch wasn't even that big. What was even in it? Removed the Frostivus background, the Frostivus custom game (someone must have hit the "Remove all custom games" button by accident) (Trivia: the game was removed a week ago. Did anyone notice?), and added some random leaks to a new hero.

They literally made the most MINOR of changes to the game and managed to completely break EVERYTHING in custom games.

The RPG is cancelled, not me nor anyone on the team has enough patience with Valve to see it through. I will probably develop it as a standalone, I didn't want to because its 2-3x more labor intensive but it's better then this.

The IMBA developers are fed up, their game is incredibly broken as well. DoctorGester, the modder behind Crumbling Island Arena has practically abandoned all modding. Darklord, the modder who made Feastivus and Legends of Dota Redux has left. 

Sorry just had to rant.

E/ To copy paste this response from the original thread- the game isn't a carbon copy of diablo 2, it is its own independent IP with characters and stuff but the gameplay was designed around the old school ARPGS like diablo. Referencing it as diablo 2 gives people an immediate feel about what the game is supposed to be about without referencing the entire 10 page GDD though.

2e/ The last patch fixed everything. As I said, this decision is irreversible. This is the 999th time this has happened. It isn't an acceptable form of communcation.

Valve, I know you read this thread.

Please just talk. That's all we ask.~|complaint

Valve, Infusers were a bad idea. Don't bring them to future Major's content.|self.DotA2|~Infusers have been brought up before and they generally garner negative reactions. 

Essentially, infuser is a "style unlocker" upgrade, similar to "courier upgrade" tools that have previously been added to various compendium levels.

**There are however 2 main differences that make this system unfriendly towards customers and disincentivizing in terms of pursuing aquisition of more infused sets :**

**1.** Unlike golden items / genuine items / generally unique items, an "infused" item is the very same piece of cosmetic player already has, but with unlocked feature. If a player has an item that also exists in some more "extraordinary" form (like golden), he arguably only posses an "inferior" version, but the existence of separate, fleshed out cosmetic is still undeniable. At the end of the day, he has a set that is a result of hard work and creativity of the great folks over at the Workshop. 

**Basically :** The fact that I have a set that is "worse" unless Infuser is applied diminishes my enjoyment from having acquired it. I'd rather know there was "better version" (like golden items), than be reminded every time I look at it in armory that I wasn't lucky enough to get an infuser. 

**2.** Unnecessary focus on tier-ing of rewards. Compendiums were supposed to be about the event and associated with it community's participation. Players interacting, artists promoting, players performing.

With the new elements introduced in Fall Major (Infusers, Coin Cache) and removal of anything remotely related to the event itself, other than general information, compendium became glorified cosmetics bundle, that also gives access to buying more cosmetics and "challenges" which (in my personal opinion) hurt the game in general, by introducing player-specific agendas. 

**I understand those are just 2 general points** and many other players can voice their own criticism of Infusers, and Compendium as a whole. Event was great, matches were great, but the digital "interactive" portion was subpar when compared to previous ones. 

**Tl;dr** Please don't use Infusers in the future. Idea sucks. Just make separate "rare" items like you used to. ~|complaint

My experience at Team Liquid Store, lost $150 of merchandise and never received the promised refund|self.DotA2|~Edit: Issue resolved, /r/TLPlexa made a [prompt response](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2qwpp5/my_experience_at_team_liquid_store_lost_150_of/cnaad5n) and I have received the refund and a generous compensation. Happy new year to everyone!

Been through some terrible experience at Team Liquid Store and thought it might be useful for some of you that are planning to buy there.

1. Around mid September, the Windranger T-shirt with Rainmaker code was restocked on TL store. Some friends and I figured that we would like to buy some and share the shipping cost since Valve Store doesn't deliver to my country. So I placed an order for 5 T-shirts at $30/each. That's a subtotal of $150 plus $19.75 shipping cost.
2. On 17 Sep, I received an email from TL store that my order has been shipped. But according to [USPS tracking](https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction?qtc_tLabels1=LN151272615US) it's stuck in Chicago since the second day.
3. On 26 Oct, still haven't received my order yet and unable to track, I sent the first email to TL support and they said it'd take up to 8 weeks to arrive.
4. On 18 Nov, which is about 9 weeks after delivery, I sent yet another to their support and was promised a refund.
5. But... I never received the refund and they haven't replied to my email asking for status for more than 2 weeks. (And my friend hasn't paid me either)

I had been a fan of TL since pre-TI3 days, but things like this just make me advise everyone not to shop at TL Store. I would take Steam Support over this at any time.

* [Link to PayPal's response to their closing my dispute](http://i.imgur.com/lar212T.png)

TL;DR: I spent ~~$170 at Team Liquid Store. Have never received the items, was promised a refund, but no longer hearing from their support any more.~|complaint
Valve you're killing custom games with the Top 10 list. PLEASE FIX - I beg you|self.DotA2|~I've been playing and loving custom games since starcraft 1. I've always played them far more than the standard game. Played them for pretty much the entire duration they remained populated. That is, of course, until Starcraft2's custom games iteration.

The top10 list made finding a game not on it take an absurd amount of time, if not completely impossible. Most of the games on the list weren't very fun I only found a couple interesting and could play those only so much before I tired of them. Where previous custom games were fun for literally years, blizzard's implementation in starcraft2 got boring in mere months and I moved on.

I've been playing customs in dota2 since the start of reborn beta, and actually for the past ~~2 months completely stopped playing dota in favor of customs.  Most unpopular but very fun games enjoyed a population surge both at reborn beta launch and official launch, but they are starting to run thin. They will die out completely very soon.

Your current implementation with both a Top10 list and a lobby list is certainly better than Blizzard's in Starcraft2, but only just barely, and both are clearly vastly inferior to SC1/WC3 b.net. To illustrate very clearly just how much of an impact the Top10 list has, just look at the Naval Warfare daily users. Was at a steady 2k-4k for a couple weeks. It dropped off top10, and overnight it went down to 200-700; it's all downhill from here.

It's still early for custom games, but there are still several very good, well made, fun games that wouldn't be struggling nearly as much as they are now if 95% of the custom game playerbase wasn't playing a Top10 game. Warlock Brawl(20 playing now), The Predator(9 playing), Dota Strikers(17 playing) just to name a few. Developing custom games can take quite some dedication. It really must be crushing to pour your soul into these projects for no incentives and soon find your game at a constant ~~0 users because it can't compete with super casual/pve games that always have a larger playerbase.

So here are my suggestions:

* Remove Top10 list completely. You tried your experiment with implementing both a Top10 list and lobby list, it didn't work. Please do not delay before it does serious damage to the custom game community.
* Make the lobby list the first thing you see once you've clicked on the Custom Games tab. There is a significant part of the playerbase that doesn't even know the lobby list exists(I'm serious)! This has several detrimental effects which I'll go further into a little bit further down.
* Keep the other sections of the current overview tab but rename it to suggested games. I never really see any games consistently on the suggested games section so I don't think this can become another Top10 list.

And finally just a couple quality of life changes that aren't super-important but definitely worth mentioning.

* Make lobby leader always the in-game host. The way it works right now(assuming there's zero lobbies with slots open) is if I don't click the "create custom lobby" button and instead click "Play Warlocks Brawl" I will make a lobby and be assigned lobby leader but once the game actually starts whoever loads the game the fastest will be given the host slot of the game. So for instance I'm a USWest host, I click "Play Warlocks Brawl". 8 other USWest players go to lobby list, see my USWest game and join. 1 SEA player with a $10000 machine doesn't know about the lobby list clicks "Play Warlocks Brawl" and gets put in my lobby. Game starts, he loads first, and now everyone has 300 ping(except him of course). I'm not certain how this affects games with dedicated servers, but really as long as there's any customs without them there's no reason for this sloppy host-assigning. Also if you create a custom lobby manually the proper way and you leave, this breaks the lobby and in-game host will no longer be assigned to lobby leader, whoever loads first gets it.

* Related to my prior point, there's no indication of the server location in the lobby rooms. So if you enter a lobby either through direct invitation, clicking on a channel invite button "join my lobby - click here", or through clicking "Play XXX custom game" there is absolutely no way to tell what region you're going to be playing in(the little connection indicator bars are not enough).  Many people think custom games will be taking server settings from the dota 2 matchmaking component and will often leave once they see their high ping which can ruin the game for other players. The fix is clear, include this information at the top of the lobby popup.~|complaint
The DotA 2 tutorial is really fucking garbage.|self.DotA2|~I was teaching my 11 year old cousin DotA yesterday and god damn it was the worst experience ever.

1st of all when he tried to buy items it would only let him buy items IN ORDER of the recommended items list.

He tried to buy the item at the end of the list and it just would not let him (god knows why).

Next, when he died to the tower the 2nd time (which is normal) I wanted to have him TP back to lane but it would not let him buy a teleport scroll so he had to walk back to lane.

----------

After I finished that tutorial I was thankful that it was over so I could start the next one... then I realized it puts him in a FULL FLEDGED BOT GAME already! And the bots are fucking rude. They are really aggressive and would go to kill him all the time.

-----------

So next I started a game where we both played together against bots, but after the 5 minute mark all the bots 5-manned down mid and he could not do anything.

----------

At this point he did not want to play anymore. The only way I got him to keep playing was by starting a bot game and making him nearly 6 slotted in the beginning so he can run around and one shot people and actually enjoy playing the game.

---------
TL;DR

It is super frustrating

So please Valve, let us play vs Bots when we can't connect to Steam.~|complaint
Azubu still refusing to payout tournament prices after almost a year|self.DotA2|~I want to make people aware that up to this date, which is almost a year later, Azubu still hasn't paid most of the teams that participated and won money in their tournaments.

Specifically im speaking about this tournament series: http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/Game_On_Invitational/3

Azubu paid GameOn to host some tournaments, but actually almost no team ever got paid. There are several helpful people that tried to
raise awareness of how Azubu ignores the payouts like Richard Lewis (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsg1sZGnYSs) and im really thankful to them, but unfortunately Azubu still hasn't paid out our money.  
  
We won 1500$ as Team Valkyrie (which i was the captain of) which may seems like a small sum but to tier2-3 teams it can mean a whole lot (like upgrading outdated gear/hardware, which significantly improves gaming experience). So basically as a last resort im posting this on Reddit, seeing that Azubu is happily expanding (they merged with Hitbox and are now called Smashcast) and spend money left and right but refuse to pay our 1500$, which is like a spit to the face for lower tier tournaments. 
I hope the dota2 community can help.

Valve, Please do not bring back these "Tiered Treasures" next Major.|self.DotA2|~I have bought at least a level 50 compendium from Major tournaments since TI3 and I've loved everything thats been done.

But this Major, I am simply pissed off. I can completely understand that you dont want the compendium to be at TI level, because it would be difficult to pump out that many super quality compendiums 4 times a year, but these Coin treasures are absolutely awful.

The bronze and silvers look awful, so its all about the Gold sets, and crafting up to them which requires playing and doing challenges to get coins which I get. BUT WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BE SO HARD TO GET.

I have opened over 50 chests (20000 coins) in hopes of getting 1 Anti-Mage set and I couldnt do it. I have recycled over 200 items to get these coins. I understand its all about luck, but why cant their be the same rules as other chests, "once you have unlocked a set, you will not receive duplicates". This is so annoying.

But the worst part of all, is the fact that these sets are not Tradable, they are not Marketable and they aren't even Giftable. If I want this set im going to have to keep recycling items, keep playing and doing challenges and even then Im not guaranteed what I want. It is bullshit.

TL;DR - Tiered chests (Coin treasure) are fucking awful and shouldn't be a thing next major and if they are, make them tradable for fucks sake.

**Small edit:** Ive had like 10 people offer to gift it to me. I dont know if you're trying to be nice or trolling, but you cant trade or gift these EVER.~|complaint

At some point, ppd got picked off right in the middle of the map, all by himself, with no vision and no allies close by and I decided to call him out on that on the chat and, voi-la, I got banned for life from the chat.

Playing in U.S East and U.S West is making old and new players leave the game|self.DotA2|~So this has a been an issue for quite some time now, South America being in the NA servers. Which is fine, this is the internet, we are inter-connected and we're all nice people right?
I've really been asking myself for 2-3 years what the issue is with them being in the game, I know Spanish because of school, I lived in Miami for 3+ years so, it isn't a racial thing like many bring it out to be and I know that in their native countries there are some excellent players in the Peru and Brazilian communities, but, the state of the game in U.S East and U.S West is pushing away a lot of new and older players in ranked and unranked.


I've seen numerous posts, I've seen numerous complaints, and I myself have even taken breaks from the game myself because I can't communicate with my team. Dota 2 is my favorite game, I've sunk almost 4000 hours into this game, fuck, I even met a guy online and went to his fucking wedding through this game. I can't connect with people though, because they have some anime character picture and spam "conchatumadre" or "jajajaja" and constantly think their so high off of Arteezy or EE dust that they are above communication.


So does that make them any better than me? No, but when you want to progress through mmr and the first thing you see is, "Me mid you shit K?" or "jajajajaja no is good invoker, jajeejejeaja." I literally know I am going to fucking go on a uphill struggle just to see them move from their lane after 15 minutes. Then the moment anyone on their team dies, well, there are the hot coals of the fuck you train, as you now have to sit through a 40 minute game of them just feeding, farming in jungle until they have their shadow blade as slark, and flaming because bad parenting reinforced their small little minds that they don't do no bad and everyone else is wrong.


Its terrible, and whats even worse, is that trying to introduce people to dota, I tell them they have to learn Spanish if they want to play on U.S East or West, because not only is Dota one of the more mechanic prone games, its one of the best team coordination games possibly in the world (://Bias), but I digress, I can't hold these peoples attention for more than 3 games before I get," Whats the point? You can't even understand or get to these people."


I know Valve is a busy company, and I know by the comments you guys make its a routing issue from Peru and Argentina, but that doesn't excuse ignorance, communication, and overall lack of understanding of the game which is why this ruins Dota for us in the East and West. I've sat with you guys through the great Russian migration back in 2012, and I sat through fucking International fucking 4 (It happened, I won't forgive you ice reptile, you've gotten better and 7.01 is tits <3) and I am willing to sit through this shit as well, but this has to be remedied.

Anyone else have their friends slowly stop playing since 6.83?|self.DotA2|I've noticed that tons of my friends have sorta just stopped playing since 6.83. A lot of people complained about the rubberband mechanics, or the stale meta, and I think that happens every patch. However what I've noticed is a huge non-vocal group of players just kind of got bored of the game. I think it has to with the fact it's extremely hard for a good player to snowball hard and carry a game unless you're playing troll / jugg / storm / etc. I've noticed that if you snowball hard early, unless you can push high ground solo, there's really not much you can do. It's extremely difficult to play an effective ganker mid or support in pubs. I think this led to more boring pub games, and myself included, have slowly just lost interest in the game. I think that the patch is worse than people think- not because of the complaints, but because of the lack of them. I think a lot of people have just gotten bored and moved on. I would be really interested to see how many players with accounts over a year old have dropped off from playing compared to a similar timespan rolling over the past 2 years. |complaint
Another daily reminder that Enigma's Black Hole is STILL missing its last damage instance|self.DotA2|~This means you're missing out on 50/100/150 PURE damage (even more if you include spell amp) which can be the difference between killing someone or not (especially at max level ult since 150 pure damage would be about 7-9% of someone's max health as damage at that point in the match)

Also just tested this with Agh's upgrade and it still doesn't work. Since each tick of Midnight Pulse deals 5.25% of the enemy's max HP as PURE damage, it means that Enigma's Black Hole with Aghanim's Scepter is currently missing out on 50/100/150 pure damage PLUS 5.25% of the enemy's max HP as pure damage. Since I stated that 150 pure damage is about 7-9% of an average hero's max HP at that point in the match, Enigma's ultimate (with Agh's) is missing out on dealing about 15% of every affected unit's max HP as pure damage.~|complaint

The biggest flaw in the new player experience is the Limited Hero pool itself|self.DotA2|~Helped introduce my younger cousin to DotA. 
His first game had the 25 hero pool limit, I said "You need to learn the basics". I thought it was great and all, but then the enemy picked heroes that weren't in the 25. As expected they got dumpstered. And the game after that as well. Even I tried to help him in one game by playing in his stead, the counters were not present in the 25, ESPECIALLY the support section. 

Why are new players forced to play 25 "basic" heroes while getting matched with others who have access to all 100+? Wasn't this one of the main selling points to DotA over League? That new players would have access to everything at the very beginning?

No wonder the main complaint was "DotA is hard to learn". They already have inexperience against them, the limited tools is added on top of that.

**EDIT:** People saying removing it will encourage smurfs, I don't think it will. Regardless of whether a 25 hero limit or not is in place, smurfs will always be present. 

**However** a newbie PA CAN kill a smurf Sniper with a little luck, regardless of skill level. But a newbie PA is unlikely to kill a smurf Tinker or a Phantom Lancer.

My whole point is either **force them all to play the same 25 limited heroes OR the same 100+ heroes**, a **level and balanced** playing field.

**EDIT 2:** While you can remove the limitation via console, that would mean **the player should already be knowledgeable enough to use the console in the first place, which isn't the case for people trying out the game for the first time**. If we look at it from a **newcomer's perspective**, they wouldn't know these commands, eventually leading to shit quality first few matchmade games. Imagine how many potential new players we lost who simply tried the game and never came back.~|complaint

Ongoing Connection Issue with Reborn|self.DotA2|~I have heard a lot about this problem the last few weeks, and I've been unable to play for about 2 weeks total. I still haven't seen many  threads about it, if any, but it's definitely a major issue.
  
The problem looks like this:  
  
Queue for a game.  
Everyone accepts.  
Loading screen flashes up for maybe 1 second.  
Dumped back to main screen with "reconnect" button offered.  
Hit reconnect button.  
Loading screen appears, 50/50 chance of reconnecting.  
Once connected, will be stable for a few minutes.  
Suddenly, game plays as if having huge lag spike. Hero frozen in place, unable to click etc: but sounds continue and you can hear in-game voice. Occasionally will stutter back to life for a flash.  
Disconnected, message on main screen says "Timed Out". 
Reconnect button is offered, again 50/50 chance it will work.  
Continue until game is over or you get an abandon.    
  
    
I have no idea what this could be. It's not ISP dependent, it's not server dependent - it affects me on EUW, EUE, RU. It's also affecting a lot of other players in the UK, and I've heard it affecting other players in other regions.  
  
I feel that this has to be a bug. I have no problems connecting to other online games, no problem streaming on twitch, no problems with internet in general. I run NetLimiter to check my usage and connection and it shows no change on my end wrt upload/download speeds.  
  
"Fixes" that haven't worked.  
Restarting Dota.  
Restarting Steam.  
Rebooting modem.   
Praying.    
  
If you are also having this issue, please say so here, I would love to get Valve's attention and maybe have them look into it. Cheers.

PSA: Decrep still doesn't work on tombstone. This really needs attention guys..|self.DotA2|~6.78 -Decrepify can now target Tombstone This was one of the last major changes Pugna has received in the past few updates and ever since 6.85 it has not worked properly. It puts decrep on cooldown but doesn't apply it to the tombstone. Can this please be fixed now? I thought they would hotfix this way back when it first broke but it's been 2 major patches now. Can we please fix this? I've seen this been posted literally hundreds of times across various threads but it never seems to get enough attention that valve bothers to fix it (Maybe they don't even know about it.)

If valve can add something so simple like locking an item, I'm sure they could also put in some effort to make abilities work as they're intended to.

My Take on why Meta gaming does not belong in Ranked|self.DotA2|~We have seen many post similar to this post on Reddit before, but still I felt the urge to add my own thoughts on this, so here goes.

When Ranked was first introduced Valve made this statement: 

this mode is aimed at experienced players who want to play in a more competitive environment

This is important because it clearly states that the purpose of Ranked is to promote more competitive play.

Do you know whats not competitive? Having a game where half your team (and opponents) are running around trying to do quests, or playing heroes they have very little understanding of. Thats not competitive!
All the Meta stuff, like compendium rewards and the all hero challenge belong in Normal mode! Ranked is supposed to be where tryhards like myself go when we want to push our self to be better and compete with like-minded people. And all this meta s*** is ruining my fun in the mode.
The meta stuff changes how people play, it gives them individual goals that they value above team play, I can name tons of examples like people going for naked Agg septor or just being yolo mode because they need a double kill or whatever, but I dont have to, we all know this meta s***has a very real game impact!  thats all well and good but not in a competitive environment.

Dont get me wrong, I am not hating on the compendium, I love it! I love the fun it gives and I try to complete as many quest as I can myself BUT I do it in NORMAL mode.

So I beg you Valve, remove it from ranked plz

Thx for reading, kind regards.

Should Valve re-consider the sign ability for Techies' Arcana?|self.DotA2|~Right now Techies can place a sign with their arcana.

In a way, it's sort of a taunt, but isn't this a little dangerous? In the Test Client it appears to Enemies.

Think of this scenario. 

Techies rush to a rune spot and place a sign. They didn't actually mine the rune, but they stuck a sign. Now there's an element of mind games. The enemy knows Techies were there. They might assume the rune is warded. They approach it with more caution and maybe they place a sentry. This probably wouldn't have happened without that sign there. Or at least it might have, but a lot less mind games were at hand. Being able to pay to play Mind Games is not something Dota 2 needs.  

It's also bugged to add wand charges and interact with Curse of the Silent. But those are bugs. The general interactions and mind games are NOT bugs.

What I think Valve needs to do is re-consider this addition. Remove it for now. Once it's in-game for real and people pay money, it will be harder to change it. So it should be pulled until the game play elements of it are better explored. ~|complaint
How Valve completely destroyed Custom Games with the contest|self.DotA2|~Hey guys, Id like to take a second to talk from a developers perspective about how much of an absolute trainwreck this competition has been from start to finish. Id like to acknowledge that, while there have been concerns about the quality of the winning game, I'd like to focus on the process that got us to this point instead of the game that won.

Lets start from the beginning

September 17, 2017- Valve announces their competition. All of the developers think its going to be great so we all get to work immediately, since 2 months is not alot of time. However, there are huge issues in the rules, like

* There is no grading criteria published whatsoever. How are we supposed to know how good our games are? Does art matter alot or is gameplay the only thing we should be focusing on? Do we have to worry about players on the Arcade or is it quality based only? (This mattered a lot for us, our game requires 10 people playing at the same skill level to be extremely enjoyable). How closely do we follow Frostivus existing/new lore?

* What does No third party assets mean? Does this mean we cant use completely open source code like literally every mod on the workshop does (Lua, JS (the languages you MUST use to build your mod) are third party assets!!!!) (Even the winning entry used third party assets! He let them know and they got permission from the owners to use them even when they were open source, but still this is completely neglectful)

* Tons of other issues like not being able to submit contributors or dedicated servers working or there being existing mods given Frostivus tags

We emailed. Over, and over, and over. I personally sent 3 to every Valve address I know and got nothing back ever. These are ESSENTIAL RULE CLARIFICATIONS. There is absolutely no excuse for a professional contest with 30K on the line to not have rule clarifications.

Past that, there's two months of people working hard, with the deadline extension and stuff which Im going to skip since its controversial

Now comes the legendary Valve Email that was sent to two of us that Id like to talk about for a little while.

Past the deadline of November 24th, Valve never locked the mods! So we could still update them and do whatever to them. Considering Valve didnt seem very organized, noone had faith that they took copies of mods on the deadline for judging instead of just downloading them whatever (which they didnt in the end). This was SUPER important, because people were literally still adding content past the deadline! So you created this divide between people who were creating content past the deadline to get an advantage and those who followed the rules. After 17 emails, Valve finally responded a week after the deadline, saying

> Regarding your ... question about updates, bugfixes can still be submitted, but are not guaranteed to be included in the review process.

This is probably the worst answer in the history of Valve answers that was ever given.

* This was not sent out as an official answer to anyone, only over email to 2 (known) people. This is an incredibily important topic to all modders yet they couldnt even make a solid answer on this.

* What is a bug fix? Does Fixed a bug where the final boss didnt exist count as a bug fix? Are we going to be disqualified if we submit something that YOU consider isnt a bug fix? Are the people who updated before hand going to be disqualified? What does ANY of this mean?

* What does not guaranteed mean? Does this mean youre just hapazardly downloading games off of the workshop and playing them as is? This actually introduces RNG to who wins the prize! Two people just fixed crucial bugs to their game, but valve played one before the crucial bug was fixed and one after, so the one afterwards won. How is that remotely fair?

Needless to say, the entire community was livid and up in arms about this, but we heard literally nothing back.

Talking about the selection process for a bit, a few days later Valve sends out this gem of a facebook post https://www.facebook.com/dota2/posts/1707884899276960

This directly states that subscriber count is a factor for judging! What a disaster!

The entire community became this clusterfuck of a race to beg all the big YouTubers to play their games, and everyone kept breaking the bugfix rule too to add new content and whatnot to get active players so it just became an absolute disaster.

The final winner?

The one to rule them all?

Frostivus festival.

No coincidence,

* Played by bulldog 3 times and had 2  (3?) separate videos about it to boost player count, when all other mods had 1 at best
* #1 on the subscriber counts out of all of the mods that were legal (Feastivus was higher but had copyright issues, some other mods were higher but were just old mods tagged with frostivus)

I don't have to break it down that Valve obviously just grabbed the one with the most players.

Additionally, it broke the rules of third party content (discussed earlier) (Thankfully did not abuse the bugfix loophole too heavily but that loophole was still a huge issue for us)


Regardless of what you think of the mod, consider this- there is no second, third, or whatever place mod. Noone besides this one mod received anything at all from the contest, not even feedback from Valve.

Lastly, Valve doesnt have the guts to come answer up and talk about their judging process or how they felt that all of their competition was

> Thank you to all of the contributors who worked hard to help make this contest a resounding success.

I really feel a great sense of pride and accomplishment from this contest.

Since valve reduced the amount of reports, ranked feels like low priority|self.DotA2|~Literally past 2 weeks in every game there are 1-2 people (minimum) who either cry all game, call gg after 1 lost fight or afk/sell their items..

Before the reduced reports I only encountered those people in low priority. Now EVERY single one ranked game I have those kind of people.. It's not that I can't win it's just that i have to spend half of the game convincing someone that the game is not over cause i missed 1 sunstrike or that just because void missed 1 chrono you don't have to sell your items and feed.

I am 4.1k MMR EU West if it matters btw and 8.5k behaviour score


Edit: Just to clear things up. I don't care if people are "unskilled" or flame. I care that they sell their items and stop trying to win or just afk cause they are mad. I don't blame them for my loses.

This game is fucking disguisting for genuinely new players.|self.DotA2|~I have a friend who really wanted to play DOTA. He started like 2-3 weeks ago and after playing plenty of bot games he decided to give *real* matchmaking a try. I agreed to coach him but what I saw was beyond anything I've expected.  
**1st game:** I told him to play *limited heroes* because i thought it's good for newbies. After ~~4mins of waiting he was matched with people who played DOTA for 800-1900hours. Only he was a new player. Thankfully (or not) game ended after 10mins because 2ppl from his team left (limited heroeas have no penalties).  
**2nd game:** SAME FUCKING SHIT - he was the only unexperienced player and ppl with 2k h dota played just stomped him. I was like: *OK maybe noone is playing this mode* And told him to play *all pick*  
**3rd game:** I've checked account lvls at loading screen - bunch of 1 lvls and highest was 14. But guess what? Once more he was alone in a game with bunch of fucking smurfs. It was so painfully to watch. In the end he ended up *playing* (more like dying instanly) alone in his team because everyone left. He finished the game but till the very end other team was flaming him because he refused to leave.  
I really have no idea how can I help him. It feels like it's impossible to play normal game with people on your level if you know nothing about DOTA. Why there are so many fucking retards who smurfs and just ruin games for those who wants to learn?

Ice Frog, let me be the first to thank you for letting Visage have a positive win rate for 7 days before nerfing him again.|self.DotA2|~No really, I mean it.

I know that you have been phasing out 2spooky heroes like skeleton king(skelingtons), brood mama(spiders), and phantom lancer(ghosts are spooky too), so when I picked up Visage I knew that I would expect him to be changed to something stupid like Arc Warden. 

I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that instead of just removing these heroes, you were just trying to delete them from the game bit by bit. Slowly and stealthily, like two snails fucking in your shoes. Messy and annoying as fuck to the few people who actually deal with it

Thank you so much for conquering your fear of shift and tab. Thank you for conquering your fear of birds. Of being able to be a level 4 crystal maiden at 12 minutes with no vision and not dying to birds, instead dying to literally any other hero with common sense

now I know a lot of Visage players are going to be mad about them. And some would even say that there are problems here that won't really be fixed. In fact, at lot of people will say that having your birds be able to be killed by 3 tower shots is a bit of a fuck you. Or that now monkey king can now kill all your birds at level 8 instead of 15

or that a single throw of beast masters axes can kill them

or 2 double helixes. 

Or once lion gets aghs

or a keeper of the light q

or if someone leaves the door open and a gust of wind gets in

ect

is the exact kind of nerf that someone who doesn't actually play Visage would give him. Someone who is happy to let familiars rat down barracks and fly away at max movement speed, but doesn't want Visage to use them constructively in team fights. Someone who never figured out what Gravekeepers is supposed to be anyway, so he just slapped a raindrop passive on there and let it be.

and to be frank, I'm glad that instead of letting the players decide where they want to play heroes, we've put Visage back into his place

A trilane that doesn't make sense, in a map that doesn't support it, for a meta that doesn't exist any more

also, Gravekeepers still isn't working right, familiars aren't going immune while stone forming, Familiars are no longer blocking pudge hooks, familiars are being affected by sources of damage such as TA which kill them almost instantly, Familiars damage regen is still bugged and only one person is reporting me for picking Visage, so if you could fix some of these issues instead of ruining a hero you've never played or played against. That would be great.

sincerely, one of the few people still playing this dumpster fire of a hero

Last attempt - Valve hasn't supported s2fm in a year. Everything breaks every major update|self.DotA2|~Hello everyone,

I obviously don't talk for the entire s2fm community, but every bug we post ont he dev forums gets ignored. We used to have an sfm guy at Valve that would help regularly, but I've heard rumors that he's gone to greener pastures (and based on glassdoor however relevant they may or may not be - valve is a resume buffer), 

Anyways, if we could get SOME sort of acknowledgement whether or not this software is going to be supported. There's bugs in the shaders, in the physics, in the particle systems, in the *fucking* file system, in the model importer, etc. etc. etc.

They're all logged in the sfm dev forums. Every other forum is spammed with shit not even relevant to the forum (such as ui stuff being posted to every forum thinking people look at them). Two weeks ago every forum was flooded with mmr boosting bot posts. It's actually ridiculous and I doubt anyone looks at the dev forums or even works on the tools at the moment.

Not to mention we dont get a changelog ever - that's fun...

Is this really TI? Group stage day 1 criticism|self.DotA2|~So I think it's fair to say that apart from Dota itself the first day is fairly disappointing. I have 3 major complaints:

1. Panel. Are we back to 2010 when every tournament is full of waiting screens between games? Panel and analysis and possibly even some filler content has become a pretty standard thing in last few years and this would be embarrassing for every decent tournament and when you consider we are talking about TI that is suppose to push boundaries in production and content? Why did you even hire an amazing host and so many analysts when you use them for less than an hour twice a day.
The panel composition is really unbalanced and while I like all 3 analysts on their own, together they just don't work because there is no flair added by some talent that's focused more on entertainment than pro analysis. Don't get me wrong I love professional in-depth Dota discussion but you just need to add some more elements to it. People complained about Charlie a lot in the past but someone like him, Jack, Grant or Pyrion is something that's really missing. Edit: or I'm sure that either Godz or Merlini would help a lot.

2. Technical issues. Casters are about 1 second out of sync compared to a game and in-game sounds. And it's been like that without a fix for at least 5 games. How is that even possible in a tournament this big? Synd had mic problems for quite some time as well I don't know if that's already been fixed. The observer for stream 2 was amateurish and for the majority of the first game they didn't even show stats and didn't react to casters at all - OD and Fogged talking about graphs and observer is completely clueless showing somebody farming woods. I have hard time believing it was either Skrff or Weppas without some technical issues. 


3. Water terrain. I guess this is the smallest issue out of those but I think it's really awful choice. Aesthetically it's pretty polarizing terrain and it's overall pretty niche to be put for everybody but the main problem is that TI always brings so many new people that watch just because it's TI and have never played by themselves or stopped playing for a while and for them, this must be so confusing. As someone who hates Skywrath looks like Dragon Knight threads this terrain took me about a whole game playing it to really get it. Also those whales sounds.

If this was some other tournament who really cares, but this is TI for Christ sake, the celebration of Dota and the first day is worse than non-major tournaments.


**Edit:** So that it isn't just complaining but more of something that resembles a constructive criticism I'd suggest:

1. Obviously, keep panel throughout the day. Rebalance panelist composition in the way that you have at least two of the more experienced panelists (Godz, Merlini, Blitz, Winter, Fogged) + one of the new ones at the begging of the day and maybe more new blood throughout the day when it's more focused on analyzing games.

2. Apart from fixing out of sync audio have the main casters observe the game. It's always been like that in a group stage and it was much, much better than this. At least you have the continuity between what is shown and what are they talking about.

3. Use the main terrain for the sake of new players and casual viewers.~|complaint esports
For gods sake make AFK guys abandon in pick phase!|self.DotA2|~It is really anoying, guy is afk we need mid, he randoms Chen GGWP. 
Easy minus 25, i had to tank the abandon, ty valve. 

Edit: since some people want to misread: 
If you leave in the first 5 minutes no mmr is counted, if the player comes back min 4 sth or FB you can not abandon anymore all loosing players loose -25. So if you leave before fb or min 5, only you take -25, the game is safe to leave, also alot more time is saved since the first 5 min are crucial in doto (even I a 3k pleb knows that)~|complaint

Black didn't have Time Walk|self.DotA2|~casters need to pay more attention holy shit. They think they see something and then circlejerk with each other for like the next couple of minutes about this "mistake" that happened.

Edit: For anyone who didn't watch it, it was Faceless vs WG Unity and Black^ was dying as Faceless Void at the radiant side shop, he had already used Time Walk and he was quickly dying with Time Walk still 2 seconds away from being ready, he Chrono's and then the casters start wondering why he did and then flamed him about how he could have just Time Walked and he didn't communicate with his team... It just really annoyed me and I've noticed these errors a lot recently.

Valve: Re-Sale the Major Tickets|self.DotA2|~Karabas is a huge scam. NOT A SINGLE ticket was sold online and even locals were unable to buy ticket ON SITE.

What is this?

I legitimately planned on flying to Ukraine, waited 2 goddamn hours on the website (probably like thousands of others) just to witness this scam...

Edit: Wow this blew up... So as an update I think it needs to be stated that people were able to buy tickets online - however mostly only via direct API calls (some said they were even able to buy it via the website but only hours later) and only way after official statements were made that everything is sold out. I guess many left frustrated when there were still chances to get tickets. FeelsBadMan.

This is what these interviews are like. It is awkward, demeaning and inappropriate. Losers' interviews were never a good thing, either in Starcraft or in Dota, or in any other E-sport I watched. It's not fun for the players and it's not fun for the viewers watching this mess.

Playing solo ranked makes me fucking want to kill myself 80% of games|self.DotA2|~Is that normal?

Edit:

Since this post got somehow popular let me clarify on what makes me so mad when playing solo ranked:

Nearly every match is a stomp from either direction but mostly not because one team is just so much better than the other

Most times, you lose because one dude doesn't get the role he thinks he's entitled to play and then he starts feeding or even just plays like shit on purpose. And now it doesn't matter if that happens in the enemy team and you win because of that.

So it sucks that you either get a free win because the enemy feeds or that you lose because someone in your team thinks it's more important for him to play his role than just fucking play the game and maybe even win

PS: No i don't want to literally kill myself because of some videogame.~|complaint

Everything that is bad about the new drop system.|self.DotA2|~There have been numerous threads about the new system and I would just like to put another one together including all the reasons why a large number of the community is unhappy about the new drop system:

1. **Transparency!** It was much more clearer before when you would get drops. Sure there were some random drops but one thing was for sure, you would get an item every time you level up your Dota 2 account. It made people feel like the system is fair so they accepted it. Now no one knows exactly how things work and it's logical that people are upset when they hear stories how some people got a nice item drop and they didn't get anything for months. I know they have no real reason to complain, it's a free game and Valve does not have to give them anything but it still makes you feel kind of sad when you hear others got something and you didn't and on top of that you don't even know why because no one knows how things work. It just creates unhappy customers which really doesn't benefit anyone. A system that that is unclear will give birth to rumors and lots of false theories and eventually there will be stupid people who will try to abuse the system based on those rumors, we have seen this already happen before...

2. **The level system is useless!** This is quite clear and doesn't need much explaining. It just looks a bit ridiculous and rushed. It makes Valve look silly like they didn't think things true and didn't considered all the factors when they changed the system. 

3. **Doesn't motivate new players to get items!** When I first started playing Dota 2 I was already a veteran of DotA and just wanted to enjoy the game that I liked so much. I didn't care about items at all, it was just cosmetics for me. Sure I got drops from time to time and used them but it didn't mean anything for me and I never considered buying them. But over time I got more and more items, I started playing around with them. I combined items from different sets and started searching for other items to look if there is something that would fit well with those I already have... And before I knew it I got hooked on items and started carrying about them, now it's almost a game withing a game for me, collecting different items and adding them to my collection. Obviously Valve benefits from such a thing as I started paying money to get the items I wanted. I mostly got drops for items that are not worth much but they got me curious about others and I soon discovered that I wanted the more expensive ones as well because they fit so well with those I have. Now drops are so rare that a lot of newer players won't really care about them. It feels like a random thing that happens way to rare to bother with it.

4. **The thrill of trading is gone!** It used to be that you get a single item drop from a set and now the drops include whole sets. It seams at first like that's better for the person who gets the drop but it takes something away from the game. As mentioned before it was like "a game withing a game". You get certain items and you can trade with others or buy at the steam market those that are missing from your set. Such a system was really great for the game as it created a whole community based around traders. Those people moved items around and created an economy withing a game. It created betting sites that revolved around items. All those thing helped promote Dota 2 and make it into something more. It brought more people into it and with them more money. I know people who didn't trade much with items think that does not concern them, but it does indirectly impact the game that they play and it helps keep it free. It's not even about making money with trades. Many people who don't trade assume that those who do make lot of money by doing so. That was never the case for me, I traded because it felt like a game, like playing a trade simulation game only this time it involved real people. Often times I spent hours finding people to trade items with and move them around just to save like 0.5 $. I could have easily afforded to just pay and not waste my time but It was not about the money, it was about playing the "trading" game and feeling the same thrill as you would by expanding your empire in a trading simulation. Getting whole sets as drops take a big part of that game away...

This are the ones I could come up with at the moment. I will update the list with other things that might come up in the comments....~|complaint
We're being really annoying about spoilers....|self.DotA2|~And I don't mean people spoiling stuff,
I mean people complaining about spoilers. Compare this to any sport, even the World Cup. If you had a match on recording, saving it for a later date, you wouldn't wobble on over to /r/soccer expecting discussion not related to the huge match just played, right? Or, you wouldn't go on over to FIFAs website to look at the schedule that is directly related to the match you don't want to be spoiled, right? If we want esports to be recognized as an actual sport, shouldn't we start acting like it actually is? You don't see people over at /r/nba complaining about the NBAs website spoiling playoff games as they're happening; the users realize that it's a SPORT, and in order to avoid having the outcomes of matches spoiled, it requires extra effort on YOUR end, not anybody else's.

Faceit ladder (SF arcana ladder and battle pass) is rigged and no one from faceit is doing a damn thing.|self.DotA2|~This will be a long post and Im posting it the whole community on R/dota2 since i worked really hard on the SF ladder today, i want to show everyone how corrupt faceit is and we have to rally to make it better. I didnt drop a single game and won every game and ended up with 74 points. Heres the ladder results https://www.faceit.com/en/dota2/event/d789193c-efd9-45cc-8a13-d8e176fce044

Now, as you can see i came in 5th. But as we debunk and take a look at the top 3 players- something is fishy. You click on there profile and they have no games played. You see that "Chelio-nada" last game was on the date 6/30 but the ladder was 7/3? He has racked up 124 points. I played the whole ladder, never played against him. 124 points is absurd you would have to win aprox 9 games to get that 9 games straight but none of them were recorded. Now taking it logical CHelio-Nada has a 45 percent winrate and on his profile he says hes from Pakistan- playing on useast ladder. Anyway i dont think he can win 9 games straight it just doesnt sound right. Take a look at the other 2 next in line. Voltoo has not even played 1 game, if you look on his friends list he has Chelio Nada added. Look at #3 Dam1on and same with him hasnt played a game since 6/30 with an unreasonable amount of points i cant even come close to catching up with. 

I debunked it further during the ladder and now i understand why. This stack of 3 people had set up fake accounts to call gg before they get in the game i assume making it so it doesnt show up on their profile. https://www.faceit.com/en/dota2/room/dbe72083-00bc-4ea8-90e5-d428b84e480b 
Take a look at all the accounts none of them had played any games on faceit and they seem very fake.

Now we see that the top3 players are obviously cheating and boosting points to get the SF arcana and prizes. They got points very quickly and it was obvious as i check on their lobbies while im searching for a game.

It doesnt end here,,,, it keeps rolling, rolling, rolling.

I take a look at one of Nada's dotabuffs and hes used to this as a couple games slipped through here. http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2473143511 If this isnt obvious i dont know what is. 

Now our next on the ladder one up from me is Benito- hes made it much much less obvious but he has found a way. he ended with 79 points. I beat him in the last game to put him down by 12 too and here is the game. https://www.faceit.com/en/dota2/room/83a33476-2edf-4d40-966f-5307a206e857

Now that game was the last game of the ladder, before it was played he jumped by a quick 20 points as i refreshed the page, so i thought oh man another abuser. Its annoying and frustrating at this point. So ill take it logically here- i dont have much proof but it will make sense. 

When you lose a faceit ladder game you lose points but never drop below 0. Benito went 5-2 i went 6-0 and BEAT him. Somehow he ended up with more points and like i said he jumped by about 20 before i even played him. I truly think he got more points by just doing the same as Nada and making fake accounts. It was towards the end of the ladder as he seemed to do it fair before then. 

Im just about done proving everything, i played the ladder fair and won it, but cheaters are holding it back.

Im going to talk about faceit and its role in all this. This isnt new. I lost a ladder a few days ago to the same Nada guy and this happens every single day. Faceit stands around, nothing to be done, said or worried about. They give all those faceit points to Nada who can get all the prizes he wants and everything without even playing a single game. I talked to many live support people made tickets that were never answered and tried my best, then i realised.

Faceit is very corrupt and broken. They dont do anything to solve it and the cheaters keep doing this day by day. EVERY time. They told me 2 days ago that they review the ladder before they give the points. Which is utter bull at this point since Nada wins every day with his stack. The system is broken and i cant express that more. 

Here is something to add ive seen on their site. You cant see ANY past faceit ladders without a link and the match lobbies are none to be found. I dont see it and ive had to keep the link. They are hiding it and rigging to make a profit. Unbelieveable.

We filed many reports and this is 1 of the many tickets https://support.faceit.com/hc/en-us/requests/16700?page=1
I talked to live support over and over and they say it will be fixed when it never is.

If nothing gets done and they dont put the real winners of the ladders i quit faceit forever. They dont seem to care one bit. I played for about EIGHT hours straight and won every game and played hard good dota, im punished instead of rewarded. Something is wrong.

Thanks for reading this if youve gotten this far. Its the longest post ever but it needs to be addressed to the whole community.

FPS drops are getting worse and worse. A lot of people can't play the game.|self.DotA2|~**UPDATE**

According to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2g1v04/try_unequipping_global_items_in_your_loadout_to/) thread, I just tried unequipping all cosmetics from Global Items and I did get about 5-10 FPS more (still stutters a bit, though). Also, if I bring Vsync back, it's still unplayable.

---

I'm really sorry for bringing this up again. I, and a lot of other people, can't play the game, so this is one of the things when I'm trying to do something about it. After numerous threads on Dota2 Dev forum for the past month, no one from their staff replied. The last time this kind of thread hit the front page on this subreddit was on weekend and it disappeared from it pretty much when Monday started, so maybe no one from Valve bothered to check Reddit during weekend (this is just a guess of desperation), but I know they do check this subreddit sometimes, so I hope it'll hit the front page again, but this time during work days. Again, I am sorry for bringing this up again and thank you for understanding frustrations from us who cannot play anymore.

So, here it goes...

---

The first time many of us experienced drastic FPS drops (in my case, from 60 to a very noticeable 20) about 3-4 weeks ago after major **Steam Client update**, my fix at the time was to turn off Vsync. After turning it off, I got my FPS back to a constant 60 just like it used to be (but still, I got screen tearing now). However, after Techies update, it dropped to 30-40. Before these FPS drops I had everything checked and maxed in video settings with loaded weather effects and it never dropped below 60 FPS.

Anyone else experiencing worse and worse FPS drops over time, especially now? Know that game has gotten **unplayable BEFORE Techies update**, after the last major Steam Client update. Techies update just made it a lil' more worse, but I think it might not be the root of the problem.

After the last major Steam Client update, a lot of people noticed several instances (six or more) of steamwebhelper.exe process running. It seems that many people can completely resolve these drastic FPS drops by shutting down all instances of this process. In my case, however, if I end any of its instances, another instance of this process immediately starts. If I remove steamwebhelper.exe from C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\bin, Steam Client gets updated on the next start and it brings it back, mysteriously hogging up resources while Dota 2 is running.

Some suspect that this problem has something to do with new **Steam Overlay**. I turned it off and didn't notice any difference.

As for my digital hygiene, I'd say I keep it pretty neat most of the time, usually keeping only Skype in taskbar and toolbar beside Steam Client while playing Dota. Antivirus can run scans only manually and I tend to check up on background processes quite often, which aren't that many compared to some average end user's machine.

My other games, such as Skyrim, Warframe and Mirror's Edge run just fine on high settings.

Going offline in DOTA makes no use anymore|self.DotA2|People can still see you play the game when you're in offline mode. It worked nice in source 1: people couldn't see you play at all when you were offline|complaint
Ok this is messing with me|self.DotA2|~So I get the new Jugg ward. Great, I'm ecstatic, fantastic ward. Love it. I play a game as Jugg, get excited to use it and pop it when I need to heal. The cat makes this adorable meow, and my HP is going up. Life is fucking great right here. Valve finally didn't shit the bed for once. 

And then the timer runs out on the ward. Instead of another cute meow signalling it's leaving now, or some kind of silly thing, I hear the most depressing meow I've heard in years play as it chokes out a last mew, before completely fading away.

My HP may have went up, but my soul fell. Oh how it fell.

Valve fucking change this death noise it's seriously killing me on the inside. I had to make a fucking reddit account to do this for christ's sake. Please. Just make it a wacky meow or reuse the summon mew, I'm begging you. ~|complaint

After 4400 games I literally dreamed about a Dota 2 match last night: It had a feeder in it and I woke up because I was too angry to continue sleeping. VOLVO FIX YOUR REPORT SYSTEM.|self.DotA2|~For the first time in my life I dreamed about a Dota match last night and I woke up because I was too enraged to continue sleeping. If this sorry excuse of a report/punishment-system rustles my jimmies even during sleep, then I think we need to talk.  

 - - - 

**Some background info:** I've been playing DotA on and off since 2004/2005, during the WC3 TFT days I used platforms like dotapickup to keep my games free of leavers and obvious griefers. Thanks to tools like listchecker and banlist it (more or less) worked. I was glad that people hosted pickup platforms and leagues for dota, so you can play without all the griefers and leavers. Back in November 2011 when i received my invite to the dota2 beta, it felt like christmas. My favorite mod gets picked up by Valve and gets rid of all the hassle we had to endure while setting up games privately. No more listchecker, no more banlists to keep updated, proper servers and a reconnect feature. Glorious!


Yet still, **6 years later I'm literally getting nightmares** even when not "actively" playing Dota 2 because I'm too frustrated by how the game handles reports and punishing players. I've racked up about [4400 matches](http://imgur.com/yU7Xm8j) of dota in those 6 years, for some reason people commended me [614 times](http://imgur.com/urtVCtk) so far (I never asked/swapped commends) and my behaviour score sits currently [at 9887](http://imgur.com/FJjb6fS). I haven't been muted nor sent to low-prio even once in my lifetime. It's safe to say that it's extremely hard to get me somewhat tilted during a match because I focus on winning and having fun, not the occasional griefers. I'm hovering around 4.3 to 4.5k MMR while randoming and playing support/offlane most of the time.

- - - 

In my 13 years of dota I've seen everything, from the usual 30 min afk jungler to the typical ragekids deepthroating their mic while blasting your eardrums. The classic "dunning kruger"-cores as well as the "I don't know what I'm doing"-supports. But I don't care about bad players or even normal players having a bad game. What really pisses me off the most is that **this community can't get rid of the obvious bad apples** because we don't have the tools to punish them **efficiently** (and this sometimes means: **permanently**). During the last months I've mostly played TI ranked and was appalled when I realized that smurf low-level accounts can bypass the normal restrictions of ranked matchmaking by purchasing the battlepass. 

Due to this circumstance I've experienced some of the worst matches of my dota lifetime. The worst part of it: 75% of the time I can't even report the offenders because I've already used up my "chances" for the week, even though I only report heavy, insufferable offenders. It's probably been a year since I last reported someone for chat abuse/toxic behavior because I know that those reports go straight to the trash bin and minimize my chances to "punish" the real griefers. Meanwhile the real game ruiners roam free while the people trying to report them are greeted by the almost gleeful ["welcoming new players" banner ad](http://imgur.com/NGcg5d0) right after having to endure 30-60 minutes of absolute time-wasting due to excessive griefing and feeding. 

It's [games like these](https://www.opendota.com/matches/3382987723/overview) when you lose all faith in the report/punishment system because the offenders (furion/invoker both wanting mid, furion therefore tps to the enemy base and starts feeding wards/courier/heroes while mouthbreathing into his mic and laughing) won't ever experience repercussions for wasting the time of all other players. And if you want to report the offenders, you'll have to endure the game however long the griefer forces you to stay because otherwise you can't even check if you've still got an opportunity to report him...or you're out of reports for the week and have to shrug it off. It's infuriatingly bad and I can't even fathom why, after six years of Dota 2 being on the market, we don't have a proper way to get rid of toxic, intentionally malicious players in our games. You've enforced a phone-number registration for ranked games, so start banning malicious griefers / feeders / intentional game ruiners already. Don't reward them with a cheap "solution" (TI ranked) for their smurfs, but instead fucking also ban the smurf-accounts. We know VAC can identify and ban multiple accounts connected to the same cheater, why not do the same for malicious griefers?

- - - 
TLDR / plead for sanity:

**Valve, please fix the report/punishment-system.** It's ridiculous to even think about bringing in new players to this game when the old ones can't even properly defend themselves against malicious griefing and game ruining. I'm sick of wasting my time because we don't have an Overwatch-System like in CS:GO to manually weed out the black sheep of the community. The current "punishment" of putting people into low-prio clearly doesn't work (due to rampant botting/the LP mechanics and its "success" conditions). To one-up this already broken mess: most of the time in ranked games offenders can't even get reported by their victims because they haven't been allotted enough tickets to report someone. It's a complete farce and all it does is drive off the "socially adjusted" players while leaving the worst behaving ones untouched to roam free and harass everyone. It's sickening and literally gives me nightmares.

Thank you for reading.

The sad thing about Dota plus is not the "p2w" but that it has features which can immensely help new players instead of our current "tutorial" system.|self.DotA2|IMO the Dota plus guide features (during game) should be included for all new players (minus the percentages).

Can we stop this "the game is dying" mentality|self.DotA2|~I get that we are losing palyers and Dota has alot of issues. But constantly repeating that the game is dying wont do any good to that. Quite the opposite, you discourage more and more people to play or try the game out, because why should you play a dying game? Besides we still have ALOT of people playing. So dont turn this into a self fullfilling prophecy.

Edit: to clarify my point. I dont say that we arent losing palyers right now, I say that we shouldnt treat Dota as a dying game, because that will kill it. You just increase the displeasure you and other people have with it instead of trying to enjoy it. Because again who wants to paly a dying game?~|complaint

Another year ODpixel getting robbed on finals day|self.DotA2|~Seriously, this guy brings hype every game. He puts his soul into each and every cast. Worked his way up from nothing. He literally gets red faced with veins popping every cast.

And another TI comes and my favorite caster doesn't get to cast on finals day. I understand that tobi pretty much has a monopoly on grand finals but at least give this man lower bracket finals?

Delays in streaming matches is getting ridiculous.|self.DotA2|~I am a normal Dota 2 player, and I know my opinion won't be taken into consideration, but Please, can anyone get this message to the staff who work on managing/casting tournaments. LD, Tobi, Ayesee, GoDz, anyone, Ice Frog, Gabe Newell for hell sakes.

I Have never in my life seen a match between two teams start at the exact right time its being reported. There always have to be a 10 - 30 minute delay. and sometimes postponed to another day, and let me be clear here, I'm not taking technical difficulties into consideration in what I'm saying.

We talk about E-sports all the time and how great it is and how its growing...etc.. Have you ever seen a football match being delayed by 10 minutes? for whatever issues there are, every sport event in the world is always on time, and rarely delayed.

Why can't the tournament put penelties on the team that isn't on time?

Its like the casters or staff got used to the delay like its something normal,, on streams we always see these qoutes ""    "" or "" Beyond the Schedule ""...etc its not a joke most of the time, I'm the kind of player that's precise about time, I have work to do, sometime I just must sleep! but I really want to watch that certain match.

In short, Delayed games killed my entertainment of watching them.
If you want examples, just check the upcoming matches & streams on the right of your screen on reddit, or dota2lounge, or any tournament website.~|complaint esports
We need to remind valve that the 3 month market delay is NOT ok.|self.DotA2|~This topic seems to have been somewhat ignored over the past couple of weeks. But this business model from valve is beginning to move towards the 'league of legends' tier of bullshit.

8 months ago the ACCC (Australian competition and consumer commission) actually put forward the bill to BAN valve from conducting business in Australia. 

Now this wasn't because of this item delay topic, it was about 
Steam's digital licensing of video games, however, this item sale delay also breaks 3 clauses in the ACCC's fair sale laws and I'm sure we are not the only country that has laws against this in order to protect consumers. 

(https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/full-steam-ahead-accc-institutes-proceedings-against-valve-for-making-alleged-misleading-consumer-guarantee-representations) for reference there is the article in question. 

It is unacceptable that something that WE purchase should be unable to be sold or returned. Now obviously this differs to tangible goods in the real world, however the law DOES NOT EXEMPT ONLINE GOODS. This is definitely against consumer law in Australia, I assume it is also illegal in other countries.

As a community we need to show Valve that this method of conducting their business is NOT fair, and that we will NOT support it.

New CM Immortal makes it difficult to see enemy hero|self.DotA2|~calling out /u/AdmiralNani who said

edit: [bonus](http://imgur.com/a/eESTy) Viper v DK lv 1 form with immortal (still difficult but easier than riki v clinkz)

edit 2: Suggestion to valve. I believe this is similar to the void immortal from before and how it obscured units in its custom chrono. Back them valve fixed it by increasing the chrono's transparency. Perhaps what valve can do now is something similar. 

edit 3: to those comparing it to hexes. Hexes are intended effect, this is a cosmetic effect. Hexes hide hero models for all, this does not and only makes small models hard to distinguish. 

edit 4: enabling hero names is a simple fix, but not everyone players with hero names on, I personally play with player names. Relying on comms is problematic due to toxic SEA server chat, Russian invasion of Euro East, Peruvians conquest of US servers (a.k.a The reverse Manifest Destiny). 

edit 5: Cm can get multiple frostbites off with 1) +gpm talent giving scepter/refresher (unlikely i know), 2) Sugar daddy alchem feeding her one (likely with Cm and alchem both in meta)

Just faced a scripting Storm player|self.DotA2|~[Here's the match](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1604327300) in question. Basically there are multiple times where I blinked onto this guy and he instantly silences. The axe player noticed the same thing too. These "proximity" scripts are really starting to ruin Dota, at all levels, in all modes.

I checked the replay and his cursor is nowhere near the victim of his orchid. If anybody else wants to check the replay there's one really obvious time at the end at 38:30 on the replay timer.

The whole Techies scripting issue is blowing up and giving it a lot of publicity, but I've not faced other noticeable scripts like this before. I feel like we might have given all the script kiddies ideas. With TI coming up too, I doubt we'll get a fix anytime soon.

Fucking sucks, man.

Another point of view|self.DotA2|~I have to be absolutely honest: I am foreseeing the downvotes, but I need to vent.

HOW CAN YOU PEOPLE PLAY A GAME AS COMPLEX AS DOTA? You get confused by anything! A slight cosmetic change on a hero : OMG CANT RECOGNIZE PLEASE FIX

A new skin on a courier? CONFUSED WITH GYRO MISSILE HALP.

Seriously I don't get it. I never once confused anything with anything else in this game and I am no one special. 

I wonder how you even manage to understand anything than is going on in this game. Do you really need a big red arrow pointing couriers being all like HELLO I AM COURIER!

Some people like me love cosmetics. I love them because they let me and other people customize their characters the way they want them to be, the way they enjoy it the most. I don't get why we should not be able to do it only because THE FIRST TIME YOU ENCOUNTER IT it might confuse you ONCE. I mean, if you don't learn after seeing it once, you have a serious problem. Its not as if every single game you play has a million dollar on the line, or the fact than you MIGHT be confused for a second during the laning phase will cause you to lose the whole game.


Seriously? I am sick of hearing people crying over and over again about cosmetics and  I hope both valve and the community creators will actually take us, who enjoy those changes, in balance also. I feel like we are not vocal enough.

I might not have took the best approach, but really its infuriating me than every time a new cosmetic gets added, all I hear is bitch and moan and bitch and moan.

EDIT: To make it clear, I agree than Valve should add a no cosmetic option, simply for those of you who struggle with cosmetics. HOWEVER, as long as this function is not added, I am 100% siding for cosmetics. ~|complaint

I'm tired.|self.DotA2|~I have almost 6,000 hours logged in Dota 2 and would love to keep playing, but I can't. 

I'll get straight to the point. I am not a psychologist. I am not a babysitter either. I am a 24 year old man who wants to enjoy his favorite game, meeting friendly people, fighting for a common goal. Sometimes we succeed, sometimes we fail. At the end of the day, it's all good fun. This is where the tired bit comes in from the title. I'm tired of having to be someones emotional target. I'm tired of being the backbone for an angry team. I'm tired of the fact that this is OK.

I have [a perfect behavior score.](http://imgur.com/Rw7tZFL) I've had that score for years and I'm tired. The emotionally unstable and angry people who ruin this game for the diehard fans who have invested so much time and money into the game they love seem to always get away without any consequences. Getting a few low prio games is a consequence of being a bad person to your fellow players. There is no consequence for going above and beyond that and being a consistently horrible person.

I will not be spending any more money on this game. I will not be playing this game without being invited on by my friends. I am tired of the way this game allows me to be treated and unless there is a concerted and communicated effort by Valve, I will not be returning.~|complaint

The Tome of Knowledge icon could be brighter. All the other items are well-lit but Tome's so dark it always looks out-of-stock.|self.DotA2|~Just look at this lineup of nicely stocked items: http://i.imgur.com/0JYL8QW.png

See how they're all nicely lit up?  Everything looks like it has a spotlight placed on it so they kinda pop out at you.  Then there's the Tome of Knowledge. 

**Is it on cooldown in this image?**
http://i.imgur.com/XPqk4R1.png

If you had to think for any more than a second, then the entire purpose of the cooldown dimming isn't doing its job.  In actuality, it's out of stock and for another minute and a half at that, but it's not that easy to tell, is it?  It's like all the other items in the game were put on display and photographed in a bright light, but on Tome's picture day all they had on hand were candles.

It'd be really handy if either the tome got a better background that's easy to see the contrast of the stock timer with *like literally every other old item with a cooldown* or the cooldown dimming got a better effect that made it more visible.  

You may wonder "well why is this even important, just check for multiples of 10 on the timer" - If it ever fully stocks to 3, it stops restocking and that multiples of 10 never works for the rest of the match, just like with wards, gem, and smoke.  Ideally, this never happens.  It does, anyway.~|complaint
Siltbreaker isn't fun after this update. Here is why.|self.DotA2|~Im sorry Valve, it just isn't fun at all because this recent update introduces grinding.  

The artifacts already had level requirements prior to this update, if you decided that the artifacts were too good, why not just increase their level requirements?   
EDIT: OR Nerf their stats? 

Why introduce a grinding system that requires players to spend 2-3 games trying to do the game on a handicap so that they can do the 30 star runs with full artifacts?  

As a working adult in his 20s, I only have 1-2 hours a weekday and 3-4 hours a weekend to play Dota 2.  
Previously, Siltbreaker Act 1 was ok because each game was like a fresh new game of Dota 2, everyone goes in there on the same skill level and the entirety of the game is concluded upon game end.  

Right now, its like some MMO bullshit where players have to farm tokens so that they can actually easily do Siltbreaker.  

As a working adult, I find it extremely tedious and boring to spend time grinding. I might as well just play normal games.  

Remove the stupid coin system. It serves no purpose except to encourage grind.

Dota 2 modding is dead|self.DotA2|~Congratulations Valve, you killed dota modding

Over the time that dota 2 modding has been a thing a lot of great mods have been created that take tons of work, are polished and are different from dota, which in my opinion is important for a mod. Think of mods like Element TD, Roshpit Champions, Crumbling Island Arena. It is not a coincidence these mods all have passes. Now look at the top 10 list in the arcade, where are these mods?

The arcade UI has been the topic of a lot of debate on this reddit and I think it is partially to blame, although the larger audience here does not seem to understand that the top 10 is a RESULT of these mods popularity, not the cause. Everyone here can say other mods have little chance which is partially true, but at the end of the day the mods that are in the top 10 are the mods with the largest community and playerbase.

These top 10 mods are what we refer to as dota-like mods as they use the default (maybe modified a little) dota heroes, and are generally just very similar to how you play dota. The fact of the matter is that the mod-playing players out there want dota-likes, anything else will have to struggle for players. I have seen this impact the modding community greatly. Creators of very creative, fun mods have been giving up because they realise their mods stand no chance against these dota-likes without extra promotion.

What valve should be doing is promoting these different mods, because the dota-like mods get plenty of players already. This week a new dota-like comes out, Trials of Retribution, that makes a big splash. From a modding point of view the mod has no creativity (dota with 2 more teams) and is extremely buggy (backdoor protection not working, looking at their code its frankly a miracle anything works at all). This mod gets dedicated servers within 3 hours of releasing, it gets a ridiculous playercount and even an email from [valve congratulating them on the fun mod](https://moddota.com/uploads/valveemail.png). This is another middle finger to other modders since valve has traditionally been very hard to communicate with, even for pass owners.

Now I have nothing against the TOR creators, I encourage them modding and like to see the modding scene grow. Imagine the other mod makers however, that spend days and days polishing their mods, struggling to find workarounds to problems they have because their mod is different. Imagine how this makes them feel. Just today I have seen multiple people say they might as well quit modding because there is no point anyway. What is worse is that these are the creators of really creative mods, and mostly the people with knowledge and experience. As these people leave the scene the quality of mods will dramatically go down, since we do not only hang out in the irc, we also use it to teach new modders. If there are no more teachers this community will stagnate, it already has.

The creator of Element TD, Pimp my Peon and more has already left the scene, the creator of barebones, the framework most mods run on has left the scene. The creator of legends of dota has left. I see creators of other big mods wonder if this is worth it (yes even pass holders). I see new modders working on their mods give up because they can never compete.

So how could this situation be fixed? This is a complex situation, and there is no straightforward answers. Things would improve the situation:
Work on promoting non-dota-like custom games
Even if you guys dont care about the arcade, it is not fair to keep the modding community on the line: communicate your plans to us.
Try communicating with the modding community, since the death of dev.dota2 we have been unable to ask questions, report bugs or request features effectively. (A system like stackexchange would be very effective for this imo)

Its up to you valve, act now or lose your modding scene.

Regards,
a disappointed ex-modder.

TL;DR: The current modding environment is extremely discouraging to creative modders and will kill the modding community if unchanged.

VALVE please address the FPS drop issues which started after the 6.86 update.|self.DotA2|~I used to run Dota 2 on highest settings possible before the patch and never observed FPS drop ever. But after this patch i cant run DOTA 2 on highest settings anymore. If i run it on highest settings with Vsync off all i will get is 20-30 fps. I had to turn off Anti Aliasing, Ambient Occlusion and World Lighting, and lower down texture quality to high from ultra to get 45-60 fps.
I have tried every possible troubleshooting such as-
--Using console commands such - gl  -nod3d9ex
--Put engine_no_focus_sleep 0 to your autoexec / console
--Switch from exclusive fullscreen to borderless windowed.
--Set fps_max in console to 120
--Turn off the VSync
--Check your autoexec / config for mat_vsync 1, if you find it, change the value to 0.
--Disable Vsync completely from your GPU driver panel


And just for information, my machine not  potato, it has Nvidia GTX 750 ti , 8 GB RAM and all. It runs games like GTA V without any FPS drop or issues, so this is definitely Dota problem which got introduced in recent patches. One more thing that i noticed that ALT+TAB actually fixes the FPS for few seconds and then it again drops, Relaunching the game also works but only for few minutes.

Guys there are lots of shit posts that make it to the top, but this needs more visibility as it is really impacting the playing experience. ~|complaint

10 charges for 10 minutes of special river? Are you serious?|self.DotA2|~I'm a little shocked there isn't a post calling out how bullshit this is yet.  Considering how high level you have to get for any of them, let alone the "best" of them - 100 fucking minutes?  That's all?  

When I saw it was 10 charges, at first I thought, "okay, I guess that's...fair? Ish?"  But each charge only lasts 10 minutes.

Fuck. This. Bullshit.  If there was at least a way to refresh the charges outside of the TIComp, fine.  But 2500 levels to get blood river for all of 100 minutes?  

You can only get [547 levels for free](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4jr6hs/want_to_know_how_many_levels_you_can_get_for_free/) meaning you have to spend almost $900 just to get **100 minutes** of blood river?! $9 for 1 minute worth?! 

Fuck. You. Valve.  Fix this stupid shit.  Remove the counter, or remove the timer.  **At least!**~|complaint

Roll Back the Recent patch, Or give us Toggleable options.|self.DotA2|~This Recent patch makes the game look like LoL or Runescape. While the settings are great for new people, most skilled players would find the new UI changes very distracting. I find in a fight i get very distracted by all the numbers and the stun/silencer bar.

We either need Valve to Roll back the new UI changes 

or

Give us toggleable options to turn this shit off.~|complaint
Volvo, please. What's up with so many blue wards? It's extremely hard to differentiate between observers and sentries.|self.DotA2|~In one of my recent pubs, I confused an observer ward for a sentry ward because the model had an overwhelming amount of blue color so I just walked away. However, I left clicked on it and noticed it was actually an observer ward. "Coincidentally", while watching the Boston Major, I also noticed a lot of blue ward models being used by pro players. 

[This](https://support.steampowered.com/kb/8799-WLXN-3860/dota-2-workshop-wards) are Valve's requirements for submitting ward models to the workshop, if anyone is interested.

TL;DR I think ward models with a dominant blue color make it harder to spot observer wards.~|complaint
So many of the top techies players on dotabuff are using hacks.|self.DotA2|Im watching replays of their games to try and improve (yes filthy techies picker), and I'm constantly seeing them place a bunch of mines, then 5 minutes later they will blow up the exact amount of mines needed to kill someone walking over them, when their camera is pointed on the other side of the map. Pretty ridiculous.|complaint
Why can't you alt-click the new big ass stun icon?|self.DotA2|~So to notify your teammates you were able to catch a mirana arrow and you are stunned for the rest of the match you have to click the little tiny square instead of the big ass stunned icon volvo added recently. Makes no sense to me.

I dream of a day where you can alt click everything, including enemy and friendly items. One day...~|complaint
REAL Results of a MMR climbing experiment|self.DotA2|~Did you see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4qqif3/results_of_a_mmr_climbing_experiment_three_4k/?st=iq3l2y6o&sh=e034fcafhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4qqif3/results_of_a_mmr_climbing_experiment_three_4k/?st=iq3l2y6o&sh=e034fcaf)? It never happened. According to his original post:

>3 were players who had played regularly since wc dota, with mmr's of 4.3k, 4.6k and 4.7k, **none of which had ever played below 3k mmr**

>The other 2 were both relatively new, one started playing around shanghai last year and the other a few months before that, **their mmr's at the time were 2.4 and 2.1**

But he also said this 2 days ago:

>The 2.5-3.5k bracket is the hardest mmr range to climb through as the skill diversity is just huge and sometimes you truly have to put the whole game on your shoulders to pull out a win. However it isn't impossible but your really going to have to be hard on yourself and truly concentrate and be aware of your decisions. **I calibrated at 1.6k and am now at 4.7k**, most of my friends were dota 1 players and calibrated at 4k+ and I can GUARANTEE you that very few of them would be good enough to start at a lower mmr and climb back to their current mmrs. Dota at lower mmr levels is almost like a whole different game and you'll have to learn this and use it to your advantage.

And more earlier

>**Usually in my tier (high 2k)** the odds of the enemy having tp's and detection and be the right hero to stop me pushing the tower are pretty low

>**So I play carry in low 3k** and the biggest uncertainty I have In my games right now is knowing when to farm and when to fight.

And he's made numerous posts in /r/learndota2 about how to play heroes he's new to. He never had an MMR experiment, he lied on the internet (who would do that).

***tl;dr*** the OP lied about his "4k players play in 2k MMR for a month experiment". He's an inexperienced player giving advice on how to win by pretending he's an MMR much higher than he really is.~|complaint

TI5: Fix the goddamned in-game Caster Audio.|self.DotA2|~Just like last year: HGT vs TongFu - 32,000 viewers, 10 or so minutes in, in-game caster audio drops out.

You're running the worlds most expensive e-sports tournament, and your in-game client doesn't even broadcast the audio. For 3 years running.

FIX IT. Not everyone wants to use Twitch.

Edit: and yes, reconnecting does not fix it. Switching channels does not fix it. Closing the entire client does not fix it. Russian and Chinese Audio streams are fine, English is borked.

Edit 2: GAME 2 HGT vs TongFu *still not working*. Every other language stream is fine.

Edit 3: Apparently every stream is having issues. GG Perfect World. Is this shit ever going to be fixed?~|complaint
Reddit is slowly turning into Twitch Chat.|self.DotA2|~I don't understand what is happening. Comments on each thread literally are worse than twitch chat. Flaming, shaming players for losing, etc. instead of talking about how fucking good CDEC is and how they are destroying everyone, peoeple would rather upvote a thread flaming C9 and highlighting every single mistake players made. get a fucking life. This TI definitely made it clear that reddit is full of 12 year olds who like to talk about others mistake to somehow make themselves feel good. If you are a fan and your team disappointed you, imagine what players must be going through. yeah no shit navi wasn't the best team going into this TI, and no shit artstyle should have graved antimage, but obviously he double clicked on grave, shit happens, people make mistakes, its not like artstyle single handedly lost the games. 
I'm pretty sure this is going to get down voted but yeah, truth hurts, reddit is turning into twitch chat.

Please stop reporting bad players|self.DotA2|In my shit tier games, I constantly see calls to report players that have performed badly. I understand that it is upsetting when a teammate does not perform their role perfectly, but the report function is there to punish players who actively work to make the game less enjoyable. Just because you're trying out a new hero or have an off game doesn't mean that you should get reported. We could potentially get to a place where fear of getting reported prevents you from trying out new things, which is unhealthy for a game where the meta is constantly evolving.|complaint
PSA: Wraith Night is being abused for low priority games.|self.DotA2|~Currently if you are in low priority you can search for a Wraith Night match (generally people use ++ for the harder enemies).

Then have everybody die by the enemy towers/ enemy creeps so the match ends, this reduces the game count of low priority so you could in theory be free of it within 30 minutes.~|complaint
Can we get this fucking badman guy banned already? crashing servers again|self.DotA2|~wondering how badman got his 8k back? I was wondering too because he was playing like shit against me, but then suddenly he DCs when his throne is falling apart and the game doesn't get scored after 67 minutes. 2 games in a row i got robbed for 25 mmr. next game he was winning and suddenly the servers are fine and the game counts.

can we get this clown finally banned, he's been crashing servers for 2 years now.

Remember the guide to positivity in solo ranked from a couple of weeks ago? Dota2PortalTV just released a video copying it word for word without asking me|self.DotA2|~Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTxQAib6U00

My guide: http://slashstrikesguidetosoloranked.weebly.com/

This is their video. It contains random clips of gameplay as well as copied text segments of my guide, while a voice reads it out word for word. My name is briefly mentioned in the last 5 seconds of the video (which I don't call proper credit for something that is essentially *entirely* my work) and worst of all I was never even asked about this. I would honestly have probably agreed to it if I were to get proper credit, but this... This is just plagiarism.

Yeah I commented on the video, but we all know how that goes. I'll get a sorry or something and that's it.

To put in words why I'm so upset - this guide took quite a while to come up with, write, and publish in a nice format. The only thing I expected in return was simply credit and some exposure for my stream, something that I don't think is undeserved. Yet now my content is copied without my permission and I don't even get credit? I don't consider my name being mentioned at the very end to be credit, because let's face it, how many people stick around for the last 10 seconds of a 12 minute video?

**EDIT:** I got in contact with the attorney and the guy behind the video and d2portal, we're coming to an agreement and I'll make a follow-up post later this week. 

Meanwhile, if anyone's looking to support me you can do so by checking out and following my stream at www.twitch.tv/slashstrike
