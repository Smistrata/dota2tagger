Some kind ass words for all the the talent invited to the Majors|self.DotA2|~Since the majors talent list was released yesterday literally all I see are people saying mean ass shit about who got invited and how much they hate them. So here is a counter list for all you lads who made the cut. I decided to use harsh language here so I don't sound too much like a pussy 

**Tobi** this crazy piece of shit is the best fucking caster we have had since literally forever. At ti1 this moron was screaming shit and he is still yelling about big plays from small tourneys to the biggest tourneys we got with the same dedication and passion as when he started. Every time this fool goes to a event he vomits up some shit that's so hype we repeat it for months in our pub games until he gives us something else to say over and over a thousand times still thinking its funny. What a goddamned legend. 

**Capitalist** Good god look at this anti mage looking son of a bitch. You ever heard someone that can hype as good as cap from the good ol US of A? Hell no. This crazy fool came out of goddamed no where and is one of the best hype casters around only second to goddamed tobi and he freaking casts with tobi all the time hype'n the unhypeable. This dude was born on the main stage and still rocks it at every big as multi million dollar event till this day and can cast for like 14 hours strait and still sound more excited than me on my fucking wedding day. Unlimited energy, unlimited enthusiam and unlimited appeal what a psychopath. 

**LD** Good god if you have ever seen some kickass famous dota 2 clip on NoobFromUA's channel it probably has this smirking dude screaming on it at the top of his lungs. The play, alliance winning ti3, litterally every goddamed cornerstone of fucking excellence in dota 2 history has the expert castin of this man behind it. He made a fucking studio with some buddies and it ended up being one of the premire studios in dota history and he still is active in casting shit dispite running a freakin empire. There is just no stopping this wily fuck. 

**OD PIXEL** welcome to the goddamed cinderella story of esports. This relativly unknown screaming british kid goes from 0 to hero in appoximatly 3and a half hours and is demanded by the community as a whole to go to the largest esports event in history and he nails the shit out of it. Works every day for like a year casting to a audience of litterally like 10 people and now he casts games in the goddamed millions. The most disgusting part is that he is so stupidly good at it. What a prince. 

**synderen** ex pro freaking player turned caster turned analyst turned literally freaking everything. This meming peice of shit has done it all and still is beloved by the community as a whole to this very day. People litterally tune into shit just because he is there and boycott it when he isnt. He has a show on goddamed television about dota 2 and we are all sitting here trying to win 3k pubs while he gets 7k just playing randomly for fun what the fuck. YOu ever meet someone who does everything well no matter what it is well thats this rainman ass fool. Jesus. 

**Blitz** chester the molester over here is one of the funniest people in the scene but is also one of the smartest. how does that shit happen? how do you get the best of both worlds? I couldnt tell you but when the lord looked down at dota he said we need some weird ass lovable example of perfection in dota and he created blitz mother fucking william lee and then he passed the fuck out form exhaustion.

**merlini** if he isnt making powerpoints about shit you never thought about hes casting games with teams you never heard of and telling you shit you never even considered. Melini is so goddamed good when people say smart things they just assume they are some kinda clone of merlini cause he says things that are so fucking thought provoking we cant accept that anyone else could ever be on his level. He has been invited to every event since ever and no one even bats a eye lash cause this machine of a human nails it every time its like he was just meant to be there what a champion. 

**Purge** if your playing dota 2 right now its probably cause this wierdo taught you how to do it. He scans drafts like he works at TSA and despite being one of the most respected analysts in the world he is also one of the most appreciated casters and panelists cause he brings the knowledge and the fucking dryest humor in the business. This bastard has been teaching us all about dota 2 since it came out and he is still teaching us shit 5 freakin years later cause this dude never stops calculating hes a litteral goddamed dota 2 terminator you just cant beat a machine. 

**Zyori** who would have thought this weird ass kid would become one of the best hosts and panalists we have in the freaking scene in the span of like a year. This bastard rose from being the butt of the joke to being one of the most respected panelists and hosts in the scene and it was all due to never putting up with the troll as shit the community gave him. Some people rise up past the hate and this legging wearing son of a bitch rose so high his dreads burned off and he became a god among panelists fuck this kid. 

**Godz** the thing people in dota 2 wanted the most last year was to this this grown man dress up like a anthropomorphic female deer and he fucking did it. Caster extraordinare, studio head, and all around goof ass motherfucker Godz has been rocking the scene harder than any other australian in the world SORRY TOBI. The community keeps tryin to come up with fresh new memes about him but he just shruggs it off kicks casting ass and sleeps on a bed full of cash and drugs every night before he needs to fly to another event to class it up. Sproink on you Bonzer bitch. 

**Draskyl** i dont even need to say anything about this bald bastard cause we all consider him to be our fucking Dad. Hugely sucessful streamer. Great caster. The voice of The International Analyst Desk. Daddy got it all. 

**Winter** holy shit the community had a fucking heart attack about winter like he wasnt even invited to the event at all. I havent seen a shitstorm like this since Alpine Ursa and this bastard IS STILL GOING TO THE EVENT. So smart and freaking on point the people almost burned down /r/dota 2 because they didnt think he got the respect he deserves. Who needs to say shit when the entire freaking community has your back? Well not you winter you genius bastard next major if you arnt on the main stage 4 people are gonna get fired instantly. Shit!

**Pyrion Flax** the goddamed king maker himself. One of the most sucessful content creators for dota ever, and the reason 90% of the people that dont give a shit about pro dota watch anything about pro dota. Funny, british, and as realatiable as a old college roomate you never knew you had, this cheeky bastard has made dota 2 hilarious for like 4 years and still makes people smile just hearing whatever random stupid shit comes out of his mouth. He still isnt good at the game and he has been playing for longer than almost all of us and thats because he knows how to still have fun and that friends is the biggest mystery in all of dota 2 history god bless this insane English goose man. 

**Redeye** i dunno what the hell this professional ass intelligent man is doing hosting esports cause he seems like he could host the fucking super bowl. Oh wait thats right he litterally fucking invented hosting esports events hes a goddamed living legend who still does shit to this very day and can tell you more about esports that you litterally could ever want to know. The best part is that instead of being a uptight self rightous prick about it he is a down to earth hilarious humble king who reeks professionalism and wit with every sentence that comes out of his english as hell mouth. Its not often you get to see a master at work and this old bastard is the master of all esports and he still workin. 

**Maelk** this is litterally the only dude on the fucking planet that can like 2 MOBAS apparently. Dispite what the community thinks about him liking leauge of legends the sad fact of the matter is that he knows more about Dota 2 than the average troll asshole trying to flame him and could kick their ass both in game and out of it cause he has the body of a elite ripped assasin. This dude has been doing dota 2 events since before you even knew what dota 2 was and still goes to the big ass events to represent gaming as a whole. Next time you wanna be a elitist prick and say that dota is the only game in the world just know that Maelk has seen it all and he still brings more knowlege about the game your obsessed about than you ever will. 

**Nahaz** this dude is a literal professor of dota 2 and is one of the most enthusiastic and intelligent people that has ever graced a analyst desk. Some people complain that he has too much passion and talks to much but guess what these are the same people that mute their entire teams in game cause they think they communicate too much cause talking and thinking makes them uncomfortable aka wierdo assholes. Anyone who dislikes someone for being smart and entusiastic is most likely neither of those things stupid. Some dont like him cause he intterupts people well guess what mabey if they didnt say stupid shit he wouldnt need to talk over their dumb-asses and put em in their place with a big goofy ass smile on his face. So dont be a sheep and jump on the hate train make your own decisions in life open your fucking ears and learn more about dota 2 then you ever thought you could. class is in session assholes 

**Kotlguy** This crazy shithead used to dress up like a fucking wizard alone in his basement and now he is the most handsome man in dota 2 and has hosted the biggest fucking events in the esports world put that shit in your wizard pipe and smoke it. If you think you cant make it big look at this kid freaking out screaming his head off in his casts and think to yourself that he used to look like some kinda dollar store gandalf up your game kids and mabye you can own the entire goddamned scene like kotlguy

**Stats People/Observers** I dont know shit about stats but I know that kpoptosis and noxville are the smartest number crunching shut ins we have in this scene right now and can tell you the win loss rate of a hero you forgot existed off of their goddamed heads. Weppas and skrff are so good at observing half the people that watch pro dota dont even know observers fucking exist cause its smooth like a goddamed computer program and they think its automatic. Pimpmuckl is so good at back of house shit that fucking valve tries to steal his stuff not to mention he rocks the oberver game just as good as anyone else. Overall these back of house badasses do so much shit we dont even know what exactly they do but goddamit we know when they arnt around cause it sucks ass. 

so there you go nice words for nice people be kind to each other and if someone you love didnt get invited go tweet a kind ass message to them and tell em to keep on truckin and if someone you love is on this list go tell em great fucking job you earned it champ 

be kind to eachother you glorious shitposters im out~|art
