An analysis of DotA2 players' profile pictures: increasing number of accounts with anime display images correlates with declining sex rates and rising female hero pick rates among those accounts.|self.DotA2|~**TL;DR: Users with anime display pictures are on the rise in DotA2; correlating with decreased sex rates and population decline.**

What we choose to have as our display picture in Steam, and therefore in-game DotA2, can say a lot about us as individuals.  Whether it is something that holds meaning, or is just a funny meme joke, that picture was deliberately chosen.  That choice is particularly noteworthy when large swaths of the player-base begin making the same one.  Im speaking of course, of anime display pictures. You know it, I know it, we all know it anecdotally speaking there seem to be more and more players with anime display images out there every day. Therefore, **this study seeks to define the proportion of the DotA2 player-base which has used anime profile pictures over time, and further to determine any secondary effects associated with this phenomenon.**

In order to establish whether or not the number of users with anime display pictures (henceforth referred to as ADP) was on the rise, I developed a computer algorithm with the capability to parse Steam community data.  Ultimately, the algorithm returned data which included the following criteria: Steam profiles and display images for all accounts which had at least 20 hours of DotA2 on record for a calendar year.  Data was collected for calendar years September 2014-2015, September 2015-2016, and September 2016-2017; thus yielding 3 time points for analysis.  Further, a separate algorithm obtained from an otaku (anime enthusiast) enthusiast web-board was able to analyze all collected display pictures and separate anime and non-anime pictures/users into two groups.  Simple percentages could then be calculated by dividing the number of ADP profiles by total profiles, which yielded the results below:



Calendar Year| Percentage of DotA2 players with ADPs
---|---
Sept. 2014-2015| 12.3%
Sept. 2015-2016| 16.9%
Sept. 2016-2017| 20.2%


As many of us have come to expect from our own in-game experiences, the data do indeed support the notion that **there are a growing number of ADP users in DotA2**.  In and of itself, you might think this doesnt mean very much: so a reasonably large percentage of our user-base has the same category of profile pictureso what?  Theres no harm in that, right?  On the contrary, the ADP trend observed in DotA2 is reflective of a larger, more impactful trend which has emerged in the past decade. [ The Routledge Handbook of Sexuality: Studies in East Asia](https://books.google.com/books?id=oUGDBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA215&lpg=PA215&dq=men+increasingly+dating+anime+characters&source=bl&ots=MHP5pwr3XN&sig=ZHoAFJBR-1L8KA4l-bCzcuGFrSY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjP6LnM5ZrWAhXG3YMKHXqeDAoQ6AEIWzAL#v=onepage&q=men%20increasingly%20dating%20anime%20characters&f=false) reports of concerns about the orientation of desire toward fictional characters and sexual preferences for them.  The Handbook further goes on to say, Among otaku, an alternative system of value has emerged based not on productive roles at work and home, but rather on consuming manga, anime and games and sharing affective responses and attachments to fictional characters.  

[Multiple](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/young-people-japan-stopped-having-sex) [reports](http://www.businessinsider.com/half-of-japanese-people-arent-having-sex-2015-7) have come out [documenting](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/japan-sex-problem-demographic-time-bomb-birth-rates-sex-robots-fertility-crisis-virgins-romance-porn-a7831041.html) the decline in the number of young Japanese people having sex, which has serious consequences: Japanese death rates are outgrowing birth rates; the population is in decline.  While there are many factors at play here, many point to the rise of attachments to fictional characters as being a significant contributor to stagnating sex rates.  As [this article](https://thoughtcatalog.com/pierce-nahigyan/2015/11/how-pornography-is-changing-millennial-men/) states, Virtual sex is much more convenient, and virtual women, pillows stamped with the images of anime characters and sexual Real Dolls, have become popular enough that there is an entire subculture of men dedicated to them  not only in Japan but in America as well. 

With the data on ADP I have collected so far, I next **sought to determine whether ADP players displayed tendencies of attachment towards fictional characters**.  A simple Google search of dota2 waifu returns countless message board discussions of which hero is the best waifu (fictional wife), so it seems logical that ADP users might be more inclined to play female heroes.  To this end, I compared the pick rates of female DotA2 heroes for ADP accounts versus the overall pick rates reported on dotabuff.  If ADP players pick female heroes at a higher rate than the overall population, it is suggestive of an increased desire or affinity to these fictional characters.  Results are reported below in Table 2.



Table 2| Broodmother| Crystal Maiden| Death Prophet| Drow Ranger| Enchantress| Legion Commander| Lina| Luna| Medusa| Mirana| Naga Siren| Phantom Assassin| Queen of Pain| Spectre| Templar Assassin| Vengeful Spirit| Windranger| Winter Wyvern
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
Overall Pick Rate in Dotabuff| 3.46%| 12.71%| 6.52%| 15.66%| 3.89%| 17.30%| 12.13%| 9.11%| 5.94%| 16.78%| 3.29%| 25.14%| 9.94%| 9.41%| 8.01%| 9.12%| 16.95%| 2.57%
ADP player pick rate| 4.82%| 20.23%| 8.21%| 17.70%| 5.13%| 18.64%| 15.36%| 11.49%| 7.35%| 19.02%| 8.18%| 26.67%| 14.52%| 10.73%| 14.40%| 12.86%| 20.29%| 4.13%
Difference in ADP players| +1.36%| +7.52%| +1.69%| +2.04%| +1.24%| +1.34%| +3.23%| +2.38%| +1.41%| +2.24%| +4.89%| +1.53%| +4.58%| +1.32%| +6.39%| +3.74%| +3.34%| +1.56%


Strikingly, **ADP users picked all 18 female heroes at a higher rate than the overall population**.  There are certain obvious favorites among ADP players in their choice of waifu; Crystal Maiden, Templar Assassin, Naga Siren, and Queen of Pain seem to be particularly popular.  On the whole, this data suggests ADP players are more likely to pick female heroes, and as such, their likelihood to become attached to these or other fictional characters reduces the likelihood that they would pursue real relationships over those perceived to be happening in a fantastical pseudo-reality. 

**In conclusion, there has been a striking increase in the number of ADP users in DotA2 over the past three years.  Further study of ADP players revealed a propensity to pick female heroes, suggestive of an attachment to fictional characters.**  This pattern mirrors real-life issues of declining interest in sex and resulting population decreases in some populations.  The correlation between ADP users and decline in sex rates is a trend that is expected to continue over the next few years ([as this graph depicts](https://imgur.com/a/1t5MI)), although further study is required to determine direct cause-and-effect relationships between the two.  

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to your comments.

Overview and simple analyse of an boosted/bought account, and why it is ruining this game.|self.DotA2|~I just finished a game where the enemy midlaner is an account buyer. Before the horn some1 on my team says 'oh look at sf's profile'. i clicked it and see full page of losses with only one green. and [his profile looked like this.](http://imgur.com/a/qGQEh) btw that's seriously the worst looking pentagon i've ever seen.

now we pointed that out in allchat, the enemy team decides to put pudge and ogre mid to babysit their sf. and without much surprise sf did have a jumpstart because of that. but the rest of the game is just a walk in the park. SF went SB and while he did manage to get some surprise kills with his ult, he then proceeded to buy Ethereal blade and didn't show up for almost every TF.  [This is his dotabuff page](http://www.dotabuff.com/players/339996749)

[Here's the analyse of his profile](http://imgur.com/a/rbpgL) 

All the green boxes are when his acc is getting boosted, spamming 8 heros over 70% winrates with ridiculous KDA in ranked games. The boosting server was EU/Russia, you can see that he has a winrate of 68% on those servers.

Now there's a period of 15 days of inactivity, that's when they had to find a buyer for the acc. Then this guy bought it, he has 9.09% winrate over 33 games played on USW.  Look at those red dots, and those green dots, it just can't be more obvious.

[here](http://www.dotabuff.com/players/339996749/matches?date=all&region=us_west&timezone=Pacific%2FPago_Pago) you can see that he has a catastrophic KDA of 1.25 while averaging 8.88 deaths per games after he bought the acc. not to mention that while he plays mostly core heroes, he has an avg GPM of 316 and avg XPM of 348.

Going 3-30 in those games. that's 27*25 = 675 MMR lost. So it means that he had 5700 MMR the moment he purchased it. That's just extremely unfortunate for his teammates, because that's easily 33 games ruined. even the 3 games he won, his KDA is only 22-41-58. 

I wanted to report him but i m out of report. he will prolly ruin 40-50 more games (so his mmr reaches 4k) before abandoning this acc to buy another one. it just is really unfortunate if ppl like this end up on your team. also it's causing MMR inflation in the long term.

EDIT : all the haters including actual acc buyers can downvote me all u want, but the problem will always exist even u ignore it. 

the only reason ur downvoting this is because ur either an acc buyer yourself or you support the act of acc buying/boosting.

EDIT 2 : if any MOD decides to take this down for any reason, plz PM me or tell me how should i change my content so it doesn't violate any rules. i've been told that a post like this is not allowed .~|article

A mini-analysis of Mercedes in DotA2: using hero lore to identify the hero most resembling a Mercedes-Benz E400 sedan|self.DotA2|~Before I begin, I'd like to shamelessly plug my new [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aDotA2Analyst) (@aDotA2Analyst).  If you are so inclined, I'd be happy to have your follow, if not, then have a nice day! Thank you.

Without a doubt, the most talked about aspect of the ESLOne Hamburg 2017 major has been the Mercedes-Benz E400 sedan.  It has stolen the show. Therefore, in the interest of finding deeper understanding and relationships between DotA2 and the E400 sedan, this analysis seeks to identify the heroes which most resemble the smooth ride and quality you've come to expect from Mercedes automobiles.

You might be saying to yourself, "that's an easy one! Surely a hero like Gyrocopter, who rides around in a machine is the most similar to a car!".  That would be a careless mistake. Are Toyotas, Chevorlets, and Volkswagens not all cars? Indeed, they may be machines, but none of these truly compare to soul and history of a timeless Mercedes-Benz.  Thus, to appropriately capture the essence of Mercedes, it is necessary to consider the personal identities and backstories of heroes, and not their physical appearances.

To this end, I decided to directly compare the lore of the E400 sedan:

> The most intelligent E-Class family of all time welcomes a powerful new member to the dynasty. The E400 Sedan model arrives this year, boasting a 3.0L V6 biturbo engine producing 329 hp and 354 lb-ft of torque  the same powertrain that currently drives its E400 Coupe, Cabriolet and 4MATIC Wagon cousins. Paired with the 9-G-TRONIC 9-Speed automatic transmission and DYNAMIC SELECT, it promises a bracingly smooth way to experience uncommon luxury. Naturally, the 2018 E400 Sedan continues the tradition of E-Class brilliance. Harmonizing advanced automotive intelligence with awe-inspiring interior design, its first-class furnished cabin puts our advanced vehicle systems right at your fingertips  even as its world-class innovations continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of automotive intelligence. "Car-to-X" Communication enables the E-Class to exchange information with similarly equipped vehicles  effectively allowing it to "see" around corners and through obstacles to detect potential hazards. Driver Assistance Systems  including Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC, Active Steering Assist and Active Lane Change Assist  feature intelligent cruise control: They help keep you between the lines, and can even help you shift between them. Inside, the E-Class cabin provides an environment of pure comfort and responsive technology. Flowing lines and vibrant screens provide a striking visual display, while touch controls, aromatherapy and tailored seats indulge all of your senses at once. It's a vehicle that demands to be driven, and more than lives up to the dream. Look for the E400 4MATIC Sedan at your Mercedes-Benz dealership this winter, with an MSRP of $58,900.
> 

to all 113 heroes' lores as described on their bio sections on the official DotA2 website (http://www.dota2.com/heroes/).   The two strings of text were then subsequently compared using an [online tool](https://www.tools4noobs.com/online_tools/string_similarity/) to measure the percentage of similarity between the E400 sedan and an individual hero's lore.  [See example here.](https://imgur.com/a/D03Nr)  I will briefly present key findings below, and paste all available data at the end of this post.

First, let's look at the mean, median, and mode values of the percent similarities between all heroes and the E400 sedan (see below).  It becomes fairly clear why Mercedes chose to advertise during ESLOne when looking at these basic statistics.  Strikingly, the average hero has a 40% lore similarity to the E400 sedan! Truly, DotA2 and Mercedes-Benz are a match made in advertising heaven.

Comparing all heroes to E400 lore| Value
---|---
Mean| 40.01
Median| 39.95
Mode| 39.95

Of course, the devil is in the details.  Interestingly, there is little variability across all heroes, with most having similarity values near 40%.  However, that doesn't mean there weren't those that didn't stand out as particularly similar or dissimilar to the E400 sedan. See the next two tables below for the top 5 and bottom 5 hero resemblance scores. 


**TOP 5 HEROES WHO MOST STRONGLY RESEMBLE A MERCEDES E400 SEDAN**

Hero| Percent Similarity to E400
---|---
Centaur Warrunner| 42.08
Pugna| 41.24
Phantom Lancer| 41.19
Chen| 41.11
Lycan| 41.04

**BOTTOM 5 HEROES WHO ARE MOST DISSIMILAR TO A MERCEDES E400 SEDAN**


Hero| Percent Similarity to E400
---|---
Faceless Void| 32.86
Disruptor| 39.74
Enchantress| 39.79
Gyrocopter| 39.8
Juggernaut and Sand King|  39.81

Some quick impressions of these data: I don't think it surprises anyone that the swift, bold movements of Centaur Warrunner strongly resemble that of an E400 sedan in motion.  Indeed, many of the top heroes possess those elements of speed (Lycan, Phantom Lancer) and control (Chen, Pugna) which exemplify a Mercedes-Benz automobile. And look what we have here, to the wise-guys that thought Gyrocopter might be most similar? We find him in the bottom 5, with other clueless heroes that can't appreciate the beauty of the E400 sedan due to obscured vision (Faceless Void, Disruptor, Juggernaut, Sand king), or just have an irrational hatred and fear towards cars in general (Enchantress). 

In conclusion, based on the overall high-rates of lore similarity between the E400 sedan and DotA2 heroes (40%), the advertising campaign during ESLOne can be considered well targeted and thought out.  In the future, a more pointed approach can be taken to incorporate some of these data.  Perhaps Mercedes could include Centaur Warrunner as a feature in their next commercial for a DotA2 event--this would surely play well with the audience.

Thank you for reading and I look forward to your comments.

(Oh yeah, and that raw data I promised: https://pastebin.com/TrSdv9va)

An analysis of Pugna's wiggles: random gyration, or evidence of in-game non-verbal communication?|self.DotA2|~**TL;DR: Pugna's hips don't lie.**

Hello everyone,

It goes without saying that communication is a critical determinant of success in DotA2.  Ideally, in game voice communication allows teammates to plan, strategize, and execute without confusion or guess-work.  Less optimally, built-in features such as X hero is missing! can be used to get across the most necessary information to teammates.  One area of communication that is often ignored, however, is hero body language.  Often we think of body language as subtle cues, however, many living creatures use body language as a means of communicating important information.  Honey bees, for example, use a complex system of steps and gyrations known as the waggle dance that illustrates to hivemates about direction and distance to flowers containing pollen and nectar. 

While DotA2 lacks any necessary bees to waggle, there are notable instances of wiggle.  In order to further study the body language communication of DotA2 heroes, this initial investigation seeks to explain the potential significance, if any, of Pugnas series of wiggles during his ultimate spell, Life Drain.

In order to assess the importance of Pugnas wiggles, I picked a small sample size of Pugna replays: 100 games played by individuals spanning multiple MMR brackets where  Pugna was played as a "Core" hero.  The Life Drain spell, which channels for a total of 10 seconds, can be deconstructed into different phases based on Pugnas specific series of wiggles, which can broken down into the following steps seen in the table below:



Unique Wiggle Stage| Undulating beckon 1| Undulating beckon 2| Preparatory positioning wiggle| Releases the lean back major wiggle| Conclusion of major spastic wiggle with thrust| Snaps back to reality with one final motion to stop the wiggle like a conductor waving a baton| Motionless
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
Length of stage in seconds|  1.41s| 1.81s| 1.27s| 2.01s|  1.46s| 1.29s| 0.75s



To test the importance of each of these unique wiggles, I studied each team fight in which Life Drain was used in each game.  A team fight was described as a skirmish between at least 3 heroes of each team for the purposes of this study.  For each fight, I looked at each enemy or allied hero that Pugna cast Life Drain on, and recorded which wiggle stage was ultimately reached for each ultimate.  I also recorded the result of each team fight, tallying whether Pugnas team or the enemy came out ahead.   For example, in one fight Pugna uses an ultimate on one hero that lasts until Undulating beckon 2 and loses that fight.   I was then able to calculate the percentage of fights won for each stage of wiggle.  The results are summarized in the table below:

Unique Wiggle Stage| Undulating beckon 1| Undulating beckon 2| Preparatory positioning wiggle| Releases the lean back major wiggle| Conclusion of major spastic wiggle with thrust| Snaps back to reality with one final motion to stop the wiggle like a conductor waving a baton| Motionless
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
Number of team fights (wins)| 114 (35) |163 (51) |181 (88)| 157 (80)| 87 (49)| 28 (18) | 11 (9)
Percentage of team fights won|30.7%|31.3%|48.6%|58.6%|50.9%|64.3%|81.8%

As the results above suggest, there is a trend towards more successful ultimates in later wiggle stages.  Based on these findings, I propose novel interpretations of each unique wiggle stage:

**Undulating Beckons 1 and 2:** Many fights are lost at this stage; Pugna may be urging on teammates to help with what appears to generally be a lost fight.

**Preparatory positioning wiggle:** Having asked for help, Pugna focuses on himself, and announces that he is preparing for the upcoming major wiggles. 

**Releases the lean back major wiggle:**This is the big one.  It is clear to teammates that Pugna is really letting it all out at this point, putting his bet foot forward and doing what he can to win the fight.

**Conclusion of the major spastic wiggle with thrust:**Perhaps becoming overly-confident with himself after the success in the previous wiggle stage, Pugna's exuberance and bragging is apparent to both enemy and ally as his ultimate becomes less effective.

**Snaps back to reality with one final motion to "stop the wiggle" like a conductor waving a baton:** Seeing the error of his ways, Pugna rights himself by signalling that both these wiggles and the team fight as a whole are over with one quick "cut" motion (see high win percentage).

**Motionless:** At this point, Pugna's complete lack of movement shows how little he and his team must do anymore, the fight is all but won.

This pilot study, which will need to be bolstered by larger data sets, introduces a novel example of body language communication by a DotA2 hero.  Further analysis into other variables, such as the impact of Aghanim's Scepter also warrant exploration.  I look forward to your comments, and thank you for reading.

Envy|self.DotA2|~I imagine a good number of us know who EternaLEnVy is.
 
The carry for Cloud 9 is quite a character. Hes built a cult of personality around himself, this painfully awkward boy who likes anime far too much and has never made a conservative play in his life (or maybe he just habitually misspells and misreads BKB as MoM). EE-Sama, as we affectionately call him, is one of the most polarizing players in professional Dota 2 -- He is a reckless fool; he is an avant-garde genius. He is a quiet, thoughtful engineer; he is the angriest, most try-hard flamer in the scene. He is a socially inept loser, everything about our games community that is to be roundly condemned
 
He is everything that is best about Dota.
 
I am a C9 fan. I will tell you why that is.
 
Do you know Envys story? In 2011, Jacky Mao was an Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto (my own school, coincidentally enough). He had an A average, as he had maintained for most of his life. By his own admission, he didnt know anything but Math, Science, random shit, anime, and video games. He decided he wanted to play Dota professionally, so he dropped out.
 
Who throws away a promising future like that to go into one of the riskiest industries in the world? By this point, Jacky EternaLEnVy Mao was a moron, and the commenters in his Team Liquid thread announcing his decision had no problem telling him so (http://www.liquiddota.com/forum/dota-2-general/454226-going-on-leave-from-university-to-play-dota-2).
 
U sound like u need a psychologue and not quitting school and being stuck infront of a computer alone all day.
 
Reconsider what makes u happy in life and seek some help, - Darkren
 
His journey went surprisingly well to start with, EE found himself at the helm of the rookie squad No Tidehunter as its Hard Support and Captain. At its zenith, this team included Envy and four now familiar names: Loda, S4, Admiralbulldog, and Akke. The Dota 2 scene had never heard of NTH when the quintet burst onto the scene and began winning tournament after tournament, starting with Dreamhack Winter 2012. NTH was arguably suddenly unparalleled as the strongest team in the scene. It looked like Envys doubters would be proven wrong.
 
Then they kicked him.
 
Dota doesn't have much of a future. At least not one that's worth throwing away yours for. - MichaelDonovan
 
On February 22, 2013. EternaLEnVy was removed from No Tidehunter and replaced with EGM. On April 22, the No Tidehunter roster joined the Alliance organization and renamed itself accordingly. Envy watched his rechristened former team continue to dominate Dota 2 until August 11, 2013, when Alliance, as you almost certainly know, raised the Aegis of Champions above their heads, champions of The International 2013.
 
And Envy watched.
 
On September 19, EE, now a carry, joined PieLieDie, bOne7, and Sing_Sing to form a new team, Kaipi.
 
This was quite an obnoxious read.
You seem to be quite the narcistic [sic] character, confidence is one thing but having it too much is just annoying.
 
Also the others are right, you should never leave school for gaming unless you are already having success at that moment. It's a terrible choice to leave school with the expectation that you will do well and make enough money with streaming. If you don't like your education, go do something else or finish it and then go do something else but this entire plan is just rediculous.
This bragging about engsci is also just plain annoying - Markwerf
 
Kaipi did not have any major success until it was picked up by Rattlesnake to become Rattlesnake.int (the organizations international, non-Chinese squad), later renamed Speed Gaming.
 
At MLG Columbus, with AUI_2000 as the teams 4 and the then up-and-coming Arteezy standing in for bOne7, Envy took his first major tournament since leaving NTH. Eyes wide, mouth slightly agape, as he lifted the trophy, his teammates beaming at his side, EE was a winner again. Things were looking up once more for the Torontonian Otaku!
 
Speed Gaming became Cloud 9 on February 9, 2014 after news came to light that the players had not been paid for months. A name is only a name though, fresh off their victory over many the best teams in the world at MLG, C9 was prepared to continue to dominate in the months before TI.
 
Except they didnt.
 
Without Arteezy, who had signed with Evil Geniuses, Cloud 9 was condemned to mediocrity. Clown 9, rival fans called them derisively. The team with the stupid drafts that lacked any semblance of the basic mechanical skill needed to be successful at the highest level of Dota. C9 did not win a single major tournament in 2014, often placing as low as 5th-8th. Most painfully, EEs team was crushed repeatedly by his old friends, Alliance. Nonetheless, they were invited to The International.
 
The way high level dota works is not in your favor. Most teams only recruit known players and its difficult to get on a known team just from solo play. Dota 2 does not really even have premier leagues right now, so it'd be hard to get known that way too. Canada doesn't have a good international team and north americas best teams have historically not lasted long. Incredibly talented people like fear and hit0mi had to go to international teams for stability. I doubt you will be as good as them even with practice. If you can't get a team that succeeds in major tournaments you won't even get 500 viewers. Dota is a team game, you can't do what you described in the op by yourself. - Ack1027
 
And tomorrow, the Main Event of the most valuable tournament in the history of eSports will begin, and EternaLEnVy will be a part of it.
 
He was never supposed to get there. He was just a stupid kid dropping out from university because he had no idea about anything in life. He was kicked from a team that would become world champions a few months later. His new team was worthless without Arteezy, arguably the best player in the world.
 
But he is there.
 
lol kids and their fantasies..
what makes you think you will make it far? - Talent.L
 
Do you Do you remember growing up? Do you remember the times in your life when you had no friends? When all you wanted to do was sit at home and play video games and so often that was indeed all you did? Do you remember having dreams that were stupid and pointless and you got a desk job instead? Or maybe youre merely aspiring to a desk job instead now.
 
Do you remember being EE?
 
Cloud 9 is not supposed to win The International, just like they were not supposed to make it out of the group stages of The International, just like Envys professional Dota career was never supposed to go anywhere.
 
And maybe they wont win that $5,000,000. Maybe theyll bow out, last place in the Main Event, never going any farther than they are now. Maybe they are doomed to be the losers that people have insisted they are over and over again for almost a year now.
 
 But on the off chance--
 
Hey, EE-sama.
 
No mercy this weekend, okay?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Correction: I incorrectly identified the roster of Kaipi at the time EE joined the team.

The KP roster then in fact consisted of: Arise, bOne7, EE, PLD, and Zizou.~|article esports
An analysis of Earthshakers ultimate: calculating the theoretical impact of echo slam on a major city|self.DotA2|~The Earthshaker, according to lore, was once of the earth, but chose to walk upon it.  Legend says he was born from the aftermath of an earthquake, a fitting birth for this apparent cow-man (self-given name Raigor Stonehoof).  Each of Earthshakers unique abilities reflects his origin; with magic totem in hand he splits, shakes, and cracks the ground beneath him.  (As an aside, there is some confusion as to Shakers exact species, as the name Stonehoof suggests ungulate, but the Enchant Totem spell flair text states [Raigors gorilla strength can destroy mountains](http://imgur.com/a/cBkW4)but perhaps this mystery is for another analysis). 

Earthshakers ultimate ability, Echo Slam, presents a unique opportunity for study.  While it is difficult to imagine how some heroes abilities might translate into our lives (think Sanitys Eclipse), an earthquake is the real-world equivalent of Echo Slam.  Therefore, in the following analysis, I will outline a method to calculate the magnitude of Echo Slam, and the likely damage it would have on a major metropolitan hub. 

To this end, I needed to establish a way to translate units from DotA2 into a usable metric for equations.  Fortunately, this conversion has already been studied[ by /u/antezante and later improved upon by /u/DarkMio](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1vaklc/how_big_is_the_dota2_map_really/), who came up with the following proof: 1 block = 1 meter.  One block in DotA2, for clarity, is equal to 64 units (see: 14080 units/220 blocks = 64 units per block).  Using this information, I could now calculate the radius of Earthshakers ultimate in meters.

Echo slam has two distinct radii,[ as seen here \(circles not drawn to exact scale, but are for example\)](http://imgur.com/a/Hyn4i).  The first 600 unit radius is the initial damage range, while echo waves of damage are sent out from each unit hit by the initial damage, which also have a radius of 600 units.  Thus, echo waves can reach as far as 1200 units away from where Echo Slam is cast. Using the conversions from above, 1200 units is equal to 18.75 meters (1200 units/64 units per block = 18.75 blocks = 18.75 meters).  

Knowing the radius of the Echo Slam directly allowed me to calculate its magnitude using the following formula: radius (in meters) = e^ ((magnitude of earthquake/1.01)-0.13)*1000.  This formula is simply a best-fit estimator, as we cannot use traditional, more accurate seismographic measurements for Echo Slam.  While it cannot reproduce an exact, as-measured magnitude, the formula does yield a reasonable estimate within plus or minus 1 magnitude.  As a proof of principle, allow me to demonstrate using a real world example.  

The most powerful recorded earthquake is thought to be the famous [1960 Chilean quake, which released as much energy as about 20,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs](https://geovisualist.com/2015/06/08/the-1960-chile-earthquake-released-almost-a-third-of-all-global-seismic-energy-in-the-last-100-years/)wow!  Its effects were measured as far away as Japan, putting estimates for a radius at up to 17,000 kilometers away. With this fact, I used the above formula to calculate [a theoretical magnitude based on a 17,000km radius](http://imgur.com/a/nHDvX).  The resulting calculated magnitude of 9.97 is within the range of error, and less than 0.5 away from the [actual recorded magnitude of 9.5](http://imgur.com/a/wwTLq), demonstrating the accuracy of this equation. 

Thus, I could simply plug in the radius of Echo Slam into the same equation[ to determine its calculated magnitude, as seen here](http://imgur.com/a/15dAB).  The calculated magnitude of -3.79 (plus or minus 1) does initially pose some questions.  Is it possible to have a negative magnitude earthquake?  It turns out, yes!  As earthquake magnitudes are exponential, a negative magnitude isnt negative per se, but rather a very small value (think 10^-1 power = 0.1).  In order to get a sense of how much energy is released by a negative magnitude earthquake, [my research led me to some of the top minds](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/33gxw6/til_an_earthquake_can_have_a_negative_magnitude/) at the /r/todayilearned subreddit.  As /u/perpetual_entropy states, a magnitude -3 drops to 2 J (Joules), which is about the energy you use to lift a small bottle of water from a table to your mouth.  

This was, indeed, an unexpected finding.  How could Echo Slam, an ability that can cause such damage and chaos in game, release the same amount of force as a jumping 2 millimeters into the air?  There are two possible explanations.  First, it could be, although I believe it unlikely, that the method I have used here is not an accurate way to measure Echo Slams magnitude.  However, the formula checks out with the 1960 Chilean quake, so it should apply equally well to Earthshaker.  The second possibility, although unsavory to accept, is probably the more accurate: DotA2 heroes are extremely susceptible to small amounts of force, and are in essence, weaklings.

Dont believe me?  Head over to Thesaurus.com and enter in weakling.  [What synonym did you find?](http://imgur.com/a/V6Ryg)  Dotard? And the [definition of dotard](http://imgur.com/a/6x4eu)? Synonyms; [faltering, floundering, trembling, weak, decrepit](http://imgur.com/a/ynznR)I think Ive said enough.  How else do you explain Dark Seers punch doing damage? As sorry as I am to admit it, our heroes are puny shams, susceptible to the forces it takes to pick up a [kid sized plastic water bottle](http://imgur.com/a/1PPhj). 

Thus, I can conclude that Echo Slam would have no discernible impact on a major city.  Its extremely weak energy output aside, the tiny radius would only affect a very small portion of said city.  You might be asking, what about the damage amplification for each unit in Echo Slam?  Okay, even so, maybe youre lucky and you hit an area where there are 50 people crammed together inside the 18.75 meter radius, maybe now they felt like a man the sized of /u/siractionslacks- slapped them on the back. Really devastating. 

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to your comments.

"Gifting" has destroyed our once reasonable cosmetics community.|self.DotA2|~When a product is offered that contains more or less random items, it's naturally going to occur that people aren't going to get the item they want. Most people's first course of action is to trade theirs for the one they want. This is readily observable in any community with randomization of goods. I've done trades in card games, video games, and a fair amount of trading in Dota 2's market. Hell, I see kids trading those wretched Shopkins on the sidewalk. Remember Beanie Babies? Right.

Well, for several [perfectly justifiable reasons](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/34kx7c/regarding_gifting/) Valve has put a substantial time limit on new cosmetics for trading. Specifically, all the new immortals from the International are un-tradeable/marketable until September. Almost three months. 

Currently we're on the third chest related to the International, with a third *Immortal* chest on the way. There are a *whole lot* of people out there who didn't get the set or Immortal they wanted, and that's perfectly fine. What isn't fine is that those of us unhappy with our random contents are having to resort to "gifting" to solve what should be a simple, common sense problem. 

Gift-trading is a real show, let me tell you. r/Dota2trade has seen a massive increase in fraud reports as people (unsurprisingly) run off  once gifted an item, because *somebody* has to go first and trust the second party to follow through with their "gift." People are having to check lists of reputations, compare played hours and posting history on Reddit in the hopes of not being preyed upon. 

Before people get their hackles up about it being "gifting" and not "trading," you're dancing around semantics. The simple fact is that there is a mechanism remaining for trading items with high demand for trade but it **simply is not trustworthy**. Valve would not have left even "gifting" if they did not *intend* it as a temporary means of trade while they try and sort out their compendium fraud issues.

TLDR; Trade restrictions are too long, gifting is broken and too easily scammable. Don't trust people on the internet.~|article

Wanna say something regarding the recent visa issue with Boston Major - From iG CEO|self.DotA2|~
Hi all, many of you may know already, on the 16th of November, our team iG.Vitality went to the US visa interview and got team wiped (along with some of our friends in LFY). This thing has been really bothering me and I feel like writing something down.

Let's start with the beginning of this year, in order to prepare for the 2016 season of Dota2, we have made 2 teams: iG.Dota2, the team led by iG.Ferrari_430 and 4 new players to the scene, and the other team, iG.Vitality, which is the one I would like to elaborate in detail today. This team was led by Paparazzi, along with InJuly, an offlane player who was fading away from the pro scene; dogf1ghts, a new support player we have acquired from VG; super, a support player from the iG.Dota2 squad; and last but not the least, two mid players OP and Sakata rotating on the mid position. After OP has moved to iG.Dota2, the remaining 5 players formed the current squad of iG.Vitality.

If you would like to ask me what's special about this team, I think none of these players, when the team was formed, were considered as tier 1 player. Apart from Paparazzi, who is the first Chinese 8k MMR player, everyone else either had the experience of being abandoned by a club, or were just a pub player and had no pro experience, therefore, at the beginning, no one thinks this team will be successful. And I can tell you that, this is the lowest cost team under iG organization, even lower than our junior training team. However, this exact same low cost team started to shine after mid-year, and attracted bunch of attentions, even acquisition inquiries from other organizations. Another fact of this team is that, all team members have good temper, and they love group activities. I think this is the team with the best team environment that I have seen. And that's why the team came to me and said they would not like to have adjustments even after failed to attend TI6.

Now let's move forward to the Chinese regional qualifications of Boston Major. As most of you know, there will be only 2 majors apart from TI this year. Whether you look it from the honorial perspective, or purely the prize pool, the Majors are considered as one of the most important tournaments. Needless to mention how difficult the Chinese regional qualification is, as well as the past results of the Chinese regional qualifiers, we are proud that iG.V were able to qualify through it, along with LFY, and earned this precious spot. Looking back at when the team was first formed and comparing to what this team has achieved now, I think only these boys know what the hell has happened.

After we have qualified, the first priority to us was to start the visa application. I have already heard many stories about US visa being rejected this year and realized how difficult it will be. Back when iG had fewer staffs, I were the one getting visas of many different countries for our players. If I remember correctly, there was only one time we have failed attending an event due to visa rejection, it was to Sweden, and the reason was the invitation letter was not original copy, as well as there was no return air ticket, which were all due to time limitation that the organizer couldn't get the files mailed to us in time. However, I was still optimistic regarding obtaining the visas when plenty of time was given.

Every time when we participate a Valve event, Valve would provide us a very detailed folder of documents helping us preparing the visa application. These includes and not limited to: contact in US, hotel in US, sponsor for the expenditure(including name and address), air ticket for round-trip flights, background of Valve company, background of the game Dota2, information of the Boston Major and etc.

Therefore as soon as we have received the materials from Valve, we have started filing the visa application immediately. Me, along with our COO Zhili(who got PhD in US) and iG.V's manager qingjiao (who was an international student in UK) double and even triple checked all the applications. And we also did bunch of mock interviews just to prepare the players. However, unfortunately, they still all got rejected, and this is what happened on that day:

On the morning of the 16th, qingjiao and the players went to the interview. Qingjiao went up first, and was asked the purpose going to US, he said "Our team has been invited to attend the Boston Major, you can find our information online, and here's the invitation letter.", the officer said he doesn't need to look the invitation letter, however, he did ask some information of the tournament and the game, he also asked if he came with the team, qingjiao said yes, then he got approved.

At that point, qingjiao was pretty optimistic for the rest of the team to pass. The next was Dogf1ghts, after some chat, the officer asked Doghf1ghts if the rest of the team members are behind him, and asked them to all come up together. From what the players told me, they were still feeling pretty well at that time, until the officer asked if they are all high school graduates, they said yes, except for InJuly, and no further question from the officer anymore. A few moments later, they were informed that they all got rejected, without even a chance presenting the materials they have prepared.

Talking about diploma, I'm unsure how much it would influence the officer's judgement. It is true that most of our eSports players dont have higher education degree, however, maybe that's why they could put more focus on gaming and became a top eSports player. Don't misinterpret me, I'm not saying education isn't important, in contrast, I think education is super important. However, I can also not change the fact that the eSports scene is filled with players who don't have higher education. And I don't think education degree should be a decisive factor for approving/denying visas, how unfair would it be to not allow people entering into US just because he doesn't have a college degree?

Anyway, what I think isn't important. After we have failed to obtain the visa on the 16th, things spread out quickly on Weibo and Reddit. Some blame Valve for having the Major in US even though they know the difficulties of obtaining US visa; some blame the ACE organization not doing anything helpful; and someone was wondering why LOL players dont seem to have such issue. Well, from what I have heard, Riot has registered LOL as an official sport category, therefore players were able to obtain P1 professional sports player visa (and Dota2 players have to apply B1 tourism visa). However, this is just speculation and I have yet confirmed with Riot. But this is not what we should concern at this point, since it's impossible for Valve to do this within 10 days.

Regarding Valve, I personally think they have done a lot for us already, and we are truly thankful for it. Valve has a very experienced employee who is dedicated to handle all the visa related stuff, including providing all the necessary details that would be needed for visa application, as well as all the air tickets. As for ACE organization, I don't think they can do too much here, even though they have contacted me yesterday and asking if they could help anything.

Back to the topic, I have been thinking, WHAT DO THE OFFICIAL REALLY CARES ABOUT?

If he is questioning our purpose, we have an invitation letter from Valve, a world-known software company, who promises to be responsible of all the cost of our US trip, and all we do is just to participate a gaming event.

If he is questioning us retaining in US, I can say the probability is 0. As someone said on Reddit, "This never happened before and will not happen", also to quote someone from SGamer "These kids dont even know English and don't have any ability that can sustain their life apart from gaming, what can they even do in US?". Not even to mention there are countless tournaments and matches waiting for them after they have returned back to China, along with their families and friends.

In the original Reddit thread, there was a poste said "How does the visa system work? It doesn't make sense to me." I think, this is the question that's really on point, but then who can give an affirmative answer?

At this point, I feel like I had to do something, maybe it would be meaningless, but I have to do it. I would like to ask the US embassy officials, please, at our next interview, at a look at players invitation letter, take a look at all the documents Valve have provided us, take a look at their employment verification letter and pay stub, instead of remaining silence after just viewing their basic info. All we want is just to participate the Boston Major and we will return back to China immediately. I just hope you can please give them a little bit more consideration before making decision, because this is way too important to them. Thank you.

I would also like to thank you for reading this, and thank you for sharing this rough time with us, or maybe also start worrying about our players. Regardless of if you are an eSports fan, or someone from the Media, or a Pro player or anybody in the scene, as long as you care about eSports, I hope you can share this article.

We have already arranged an urgent visa interview that will take in place on the November 22nd 14:30, and this might be their last chance. We will really appreciate your help, no matter what it is.

Last but not the least, we hope our players Paparazi/Chengjun Zhang, Sakata/Zichen Xu, InJuly/Xiaodong Yang, dogf1ghts/Tianpeng Gao, super/Peng Su and our friends from LFY can obtain this US visa and attend Boston Major.

Thank you.~|article esports

An essay on the Cheese in Dota 2 and its probable real-world models.|self.DotA2|~According to the Dota 2 Wiki, the Cheese dropped by Roshan was 'made from the milk of a long lost Furbolg vendor'. This would indicate that the cheese was produced in bear territory, as the Furbolg were a race of bear-men. If we are to follow this further into the realm of Dota 2 and not Warcraft, the lore of both Lone Druid and Ursa give no clues as to their geographical origins, save for Ursa's 'wild wooded homeland'. The Hellbear camp was originally known as the 'Polar Furbolg Ursa Warrior', which could also hint to a race of arctic bears, but this is unlikely to be relevant as most cheeses are fermented at warm temperatures and the bacteria cultures required do not survive well in the cold. According to CultureCheeseMag.com Northern societies generally favour savoury cheeses with thicker rinds, primarily for use in hot dishes such as Gratin, Fondue or Raclette. Therefore, the icon for the [Dota 2 Cheese](http://imgur.com/7BihwMz) is undoubtedly far from examples such as the autumnal [Rogue River Blue](http://imgur.com/NnoYSvJ) or the [Rush Creek Reserve](http://imgur.com/kvRoicx) produced in Wisconsin.

As a result, we are led to believe that the Dota 2 Cheese was manufactured in wooded bear country. One might think at first that the cheese was modelled on [Edam](http://imgur.com/grM5McD), as the colourful rind is similar and the cheese itself is traditionally moulded to fit a roughly cylindrical shape, with slight rounding, which bears similarity to the curve of the outward face of the cheese. Moreover, Edam does not spoil, according to 'A History of Edam' from edam.com, and instead hardens. This would again support the lore presented by Dota 2, as it is understood that Roshan has held the cheese since his decision to kill a shopkeeper to claim the Aegis of Immortals. The holes in the [icon](http://imgur.com/7BihwMz) also appear to have held up over time. However, the Edam theory can be disproven by the disappearance of bears from the Netherlands, where the cheese is produced, due to hunting and habitat destruction, such that the latest records indicate that they existed outside of captivity no later than the 11th century. A similar conclusion can be applied to Gouda, also a product of the Netherlands.

Alternatively, [Emmental](http://imgur.com/edyUl2V) is a Swiss Cheese, a country that would certainly fit the description 'wooded'. It is similarly hard and holey, and could also be applied to the Northern Furbolgs, due to its use in molten cheese dishes as mentioned above. However, it is an unpasteurised cheese, which impacts its longevity, and means that it must be eaten after a mandatory ageing period of at least 60 days (where US federal agencies are concerned) but before it spoils, which makes it largely unsuitable as a model for Dota 2's cheese. In addition, it is widely agreed that it's taste is at most 'mild', whereas the Dota 2 Wiki suggests that the cheese 'restores the vitality of those who taste it'; Emmental is clearly no smelling salt of the cheese world. One might also think of Swiss Cheese if Emmental is unsuitable, or more specific examples like [Jarlsberg](http://imgur.com/ZjY2Unt). The texture is evocative of the Dota 2 icon, and the taste 'sweet and nutty'. Nonetheless, in Dota 2 the rind is clearly a reddish-brown colour, that resembles the paraffin-wax coating of Edam and not the traditional yellow wax of Jarlsberg.

Another possibility for the cheese's real-life counterpart is [Tilsit](http://imgur.com/In8230N), a semi-hardened 19th century cheese from modern day Northern Russia. As a versatile cheese with many different applications, variations can be used to support the image presented by the icon; pasteurised and non-pasteurised variants account for the colour of the rind, and what is more, it is the most strongly flavoured of the cheeses discussed thus far. In Dota 2 a [green odour](http://imgur.com/7BihwMz) can be seen emanating from the cheese, and in reality Tilsit is often made with caraway seeds and peppercorns, using 'smear-ripening' (by which the cheese is scraped against another cheese during fermentation to aid the development of bacteria) to give it a pungent scent and striking taste. Finally, bears in Russia are known and iconic, primarily the brown bear and the Kamchatka subspecies (although not native to the Westphal valley of Tilsit origin). Therefore, in terms of cheese properties, it is perhaps the most accurate, although aspects of all the cheeses mentioned so far are common to the Dota 2 cheese.

A final point of consideration is the cost of the cheese; in Dota 2 it can be sold to the shopkeeper for 500 gold, but this begs the question of the real value of the Dota 2 currency. First and foremost, the sum paid to the shopkeeper does not represent its true value, as other items can be returned at half of their sale price. As a result, we receive the figure 1,000 gold. However, the market operates as an oligopoly, with two shops accessible from friendly territory and two more from across the river Fag. Thus the four-firm concentration ratio is equal to 100% and the market share of any one shopkeep 20%. Due to their stationary posts, there is no evidence for collusion, and thus in the short run the industry acts as a [monopoly](http://imgur.com/4Rg6Uqb), with the theoretical sale of cheese where marginal cost = marginal revenue and making supernormal profit PmXACY by charging above the cost of production. According to Michael Salinger of Columbia University, concentration ratio and profit margins can be linked through [these](http://imgur.com/zRZXYXb) formulae, however there are simply too many unknown variables for the establishment of a Cournot model, and a strange situation develops where the elasticity of demand is tied to production due to consumers also being the producers of the cheese (in taking it from Roshan). As such this line of reasoning is inconclusive.

However, the penultimate name of the cheese as listed by the Dota 2 Wiki was 'Hunk of Cheese', which gives us some sort of scale to consider.  If basic items such as a Tome of Knowledge (book, 150 gold), Courier (trained donkey, 100 gold) and Boots of Speed (boots, 400 gold) cost fixed amounts, they can be related to the dollar, although these examples show the Dota 2 universe operates with a different perception of value, perhaps due to the existence of magic. Using amazon.com as a model (online retailers tend to have lower market power due to greater consumer information and contestability, thus prices are closer to marginal cost of production), a simple search for 'men's boots' (as the style used in-game most closely resembles hunting and not fashionable boots) yields [these](http://imgur.com/erzd7nl) results, indicating that most boots are within the $100-$200 range, which I will round to roughly $150. Similar experiments for non-fiction and trained donkeys give a conversion rate of between 1:2 and 1:3.

Therefore, a cheese wedge (or 'hunk') that appears approximately 1/6th of a round is holds value of roughly $800 in Dota 2, and around $2,000 in the US. A 4kg wheel of Tilsiter costs 79.99 from thecheeseandwineshop.com or $103.24; disregarding second degree price discrimination a 40kg wheel would thus cost only $1,032.4 or half of our desired value. A 40kg wheel of Parmigiano Reggiano from the same site costs a very close $1,032.71. Therefore, cost analysis is also inconclusive, and the elusive $2,000, medium-soft cheese of Dota 2 is currently unknown when taking into account the many factors that determine price.

Overall, the cheese that most closely resembles the cheese dropped by Roshan in Dota 2 is likely to be Tilsiter, the Prussian variety that accommodates for the item's subtle nuances in appearance and, perhaps less subtly, in flavour. Whilst both Edam and Emmental offer similarities, they are both too rigid in their description and cannot be said to be the model of the fermented product displayed in-game. Although a fiscal approach is flawed, for the most part I am confident that the process of evaluation taken in this essay has led to a correct conclusion regarding its identity.~|article
DDoS in DOTA 2 for Dummies: Everything you need to know. With pictures.|self.DotA2|~[TL;DR](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/154/912/berneydidnotread.gif): Don't let **ANYONE** get a hold of your IP. Buy a VPN. Avoid Skype. If DDoSed, reset router or call ISP to change your IP.

With DDoS being so popular right now in pro games, I decided to write a guide on what it means and what it is for DOTA 2. So let's get started and I hope you find some of my advice helpful. **For the average player, this guide is just information which they probably don't need. Pro-players should get informed and maybe use some of the advice.**


**What is DDoS?**

There are tons and tons of information you can google about this subject so I'll try to be brief: DDoS is an attack triggered by a computer or server that receives a target and the order to start. Once started, [a network of infected computers](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/images/csc_child_pages/white_papers/ddos_fig02.jpg) will begin sending dead packets (useless data) to the target's router and hence blocking all sorts of communication. Imagine [a river flooded with trash and your router is trying to get rid of it with a shovel](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20100802/00221917f7600dc04ded0d.jpg).


**How does it happen?**

First things first. In every DDoS attacks there are only two things that matter:

*Service provider: The attacker first has to find a DDoS service provider or as they are called nowadays: "Stressers". They are paid services and their prices depend on the amount of time they want to DDoS you for and how much bandwidth they offer (possible amount of trash they can throw at your router).

*The target: A target is identified by its IP address. If they have it, they can DDoS it. The attacker may encounter port problems but with enough dedication he WILL find the spot.

Once they have your IP they can use the DDoS provider to send trash packets to your router and eventually make your connection so painfully slow that you'll think you're disconnected.

So if one of these salty assh* gets their hand on the Dota 2 server's IP and they happen to be renting a DDoS Service then [this will probably happen](http://i.imgur.com/oGrtFRk.jpg). 

*Note:* Picture taken from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/31n2rm/this_was_just_stupid_volvo_pls_bristle_paused_at/).


**How are IPs leaked?**

This is probably the most important part about DDoS. If there is no target, then there is nothing to DDoS.

Now, Valve server IPs are extremely easy to find so even scriptkiddies could DDoS the servers somewhat easily. So, how do you find the IP?

*[You can ask Dota 2 to give you the IP](http://prntscr.com/6qfx0c). 

*Even if they spoofed the server's IP in the console, you could use a [Packet Sniffer and find it anyways](http://prntscr.com/6qg5uo).


Okay but that's for when Dota 2 servers get DDoSed, what about **pro players**?


*Your IP can be found by using a Skype resolver. All they need to find your IP is your Skype username. Even if you're online, the system will have your last used IP on file. [Example](http://prntscr.com/6qg27w).

*There are several other ways of finding your IP such as [Email sender IP](http://aruljohn.com/info/images/howto_yahoo2.png), ~~~~[packet sniffing Steam Voice Chat](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/919017593061261582/08BE37D3477D124CEAB3473183E81311D6381793/)~~~~, and probably any number of other ways that I haven't heard of yet.


**Example**

So I found a free DDoS service that delivers a 10mbps blow to your router (up to 200mbps I think) as a trial for their service. This free version is strong enough to take down most domestic networks.

But that's not all, [see how incredibly easy it is to DDoS something](http://prntscr.com/6qg6r0). All you need is the target's IP and you're set.


**Protection**

We've reached the final part and before I continue allow me to tell you that I'm not a security expert and there may be several other ways to protect yourself from DDoS. So here we go:

* Rent a VPN. VPNs will hide your IP behind a strong and protected server. If you're chatting, sending emails or using Skype for some reason, make sure you're connected behind the VPN. You need to find one with a proper location either near you or near the target servers. I'd recommend PureVPN since it's cheap but there are literally hundreds of VPN providers.

* Limit your Skype usage. I know it's hard for pro players because most tournament organizers use Skype to communicate with everyone involved but yeah... as you can see, all they need is your username and even if you're offline they'll find your IP. [This MAY help too.](http://prntscr.com/6qhv2d).

* Make sure nobody besides your team or friends know the Teamspeak server IP. Yes, Teamspeak servers can be DDoSed as well.

* Make sure you don't have any stupid viruses installed on your computer. Most people think their computers aren't infected, but you'd be surprised.

* Firewalls. Some routers have a built-in useless firewall. Windows also has a [useless built-in firewall](http://i.imgur.com/3fA05yq.gif) but it doesn't really matter since your router is the target. Anyhow, I'm sure you can hire an IT expert to set up a firewall for your gaming house or CASTING STUDIO.

* Don't post on fishy forums. Mods and Admins can see your IP.

**HELP THEY ALREADY HAVE MY IP**

Once the attacker has your IP and an attack is underway (you'll notice you're being attacked because your internet will stop responding).

Now, does your ISP have dynamic IP?

* **Yes**: Close Skype and head over to your router and turn it off. Wait for 30 seconds and turn it back on. That should be enough time for it to get a new IP. Now go back to the previous section and protect yourself.

* **No**: Why the f*ck not? Okay whatever. Close Skype and call your ISP. Don't tell them you're being DDoSed unless you really really have to. Odds are that the person who's speaking to you won't know what that means. If he's clueless, ask to speak with his/her administrator/manager/person in charge. Tell them you need to reset your IP because some website says it's blocking your IP.
When you're done, go back to the previous section and protect yourself. And also, change your ISP to one that gives you a dynamic IP.

* **Alternative**: If hell is breaking loose, you may [try this guide to reset your IP](https://instant-skype-proxy.com/create/step-7).

What's in a name: a look at how name length and pick rates are linked.|self.DotA2|~TL:DR: We like short names.

Hi all,

If you have read my past posts, you will know that a lot of them try to make sense of the pick screen.  I am on a quest, of sorts, to shed light on what makes us choose the pick we choose each game.  For the most part, I would pose this thought: are looks, or what we can see on the pick screen, the root cause of our choice?  Now it is time to take a new route.  Sure, if you think of a friend, your brain forms a view of them.  What else comes to mind?  Their name.  

We are built to place names on things--- a cat, dog, tree, man, food, drinkyou name it, we name it.  Thus, this post seeks to find out what sway, if ~~~~any~~~~ at all, names have on our picks.  **My guess is that short names are more in vogue than long ones.**  I base this on a trend to use short names-- John.  Mike.  Bob.  Dick.  All come from long names, but these are used far more than their drawn out forms.  Lets jump right in, shall we?

First, I sought to count the sum of sounds each name has, and ask if less sounds meant more picks (dont want to use hard to grasp words, but if you want to know more on these sounds click [here](http://www.howmanysyllables.com/whataresyllables)).  To this end, I took the mean of times picked for each group.    Stats are seen in this chart and bar graph:

Chart 1| 1 Sound (N=12 ex. Axe)| 2 Sounds (N=31)| 3 Sounds (N=43)| 4 Sounds (N=16)| 5 or more Sounds (N=8)
---|---|----|----|----|----
**Mean of times picked**| 99,995,874|78,272,604| 80,259,323| 76,629,869|78,828,320
[See graph here.](http://i.imgur.com/8xcc8SA.png)

From these stats, **it seems we like as few sounds as we can have in a name (one)**, while the rest of the groups have less times played, and are all near the same mean.  Next, I thought the words per name may show this trend, too.  So, as seen in Chart 2, mean pick rates were made for one word and two or more word names.  This test still leans to one word names, though a bit less.  But, when you look at just one word names, you find that there are some that are in fact two words (War Lock, Clock Werk, etc).  Chart 2 has these mean pick rates as well, **where it shows a more clear choice for real one word names.**

Chart 2| 1 Word Names (N=71)| 2 or More Word Names (N=39)| Real 1 Word Names (N=55) | 1 Word Names With 2 Words (N=16 Ex. War Lock) 
---|---|----|----|----
**Mean of times picked**| 81,877,197|80,025,013| 83,055,222| 77,827,735

Last, to look at this in more depth, I chose to test the length of the names (i.e the sum of all as, bs, cs etc. per name) to see if the same trend would hold that short names have high pick rates.  Mean pick rates are seen in Chart 3 for groups of name lengths:

Chart 3| Length 2-5 (N=23 ex. Axe)| Length 6-7 (N=24 ex. Clinkz)| Length 8-10 (N=21)| Length 11-12 (N=19)| Length 13-19 (N=22)
---|---|----|----|----|----
**Mean of times picked**| 91,708,911|75,387,836| 75,059,203|77,706,712|85,346,640

Still, we see just what the past two sets of stats told us: **short names are what those who play like to pick**.  Of note, the group with the most length is off a bit from what you might think.  Im not sure why it is a tad more than the rest of the long groups, but these names may have found their way in to some hearts and minds due their strange length.  

I end this post as it was at the start: **we use short names (John, Mike), so it makes sense that we tend to pick short names in game as well**.  While this is a good start, more tests and thought should go in to this fore it can be proved.   Thank you for your time, and I cant wait to see what all of you have to say.

VPs Sneg raging at tournament organizers, VP squads to miss a lot of events in 2015|self.DotA2|~In case you didn't know, Sneg is the owner of Virtus.Pro. Here is his recent statement at VPs website (translation is mine, should be readable).

Title: **How to cure sick organizers.**

I already wrote that tournaments owe organizers huge amounts of money. Particularly, I am talking about six digit numbers in USD. I'm done with investing in trips to tournaments organized by scammers. In 2015 all rosters of Virtus.pro will ignore leagues or tournaments that owe us money until these debts are payed out. We'll make an exception for tournaments that we already participate in. Dropping from such tournaments is a disrespectful towards the audience that bought tickets or just waits for our performance on streams.

We are also going to ignore all tournaments that won't sign contracts with teams. The contract that I'm referring to should include all participation details, payment schedule and fines for breaking the contract.

I must point out that with such a strict approach Virtus.Pro will probably not participate in any CIS league because their organizers are the biggest debtors and scammers. V1lat is not paying anything for a few month already and simultaneously has the insolence to cry in Twitter that people stopped buying his tickets. In addition, I won't send anyone from VPs coverage crew to such tournaments. As for Starladder, the teams will participate in the current season but if the debt is still not payed until the first of February then Starladder will be ignored by all VPs rosters and media resources during entire 2015.

**Update**: Apologies by Sneg in comments:

After chatting with V1lat I must admit that I was wrong in this statement. V1lat covers a lot of stuff for the audience and negotiates with Valve but he's not responsible for payments. That's why my personal accusation towards V1lat is a mistake. I'm sorry for that. However, everything else in this statement is valid.

**Update 2**: The debtors list by Sneg:

It's unfair to blame only Starladder. Here is the list of biggest debtors: ESEA, Excellent Moscow Cup, Techlabs, Copenhagen games, i-league.

3 Stats that show why you're still in the trench even though you tread switch.|self.DotA2|~We know, we know, you do everything /u/dota_asg posted in his 10 habits for playing dota.  You check the map and treadswitch and even pull! You try to buy situational items, you get BKB, you adapt your skill build to the enemy!  Yet you still break even.  You blame yourself, your teammates, the server, the patch/meta, whatever, but still, the fact is, if you were really 1k or 1.5k better than your teammates, youd find ways to win, much more often than not.

&nbsp;

The problem is not your knowledge of the interaction between tread switching and hp, or holding your skillpoint at 6 on WK to avoid blowing the cooldown on a hopeless double death.  **Being good at DotA is being efficient**, and that comes down to much broader playstyle problems than whether you swapped int treads to blink it shows in GPM, XPM, Tower Damage, and KDA.  

This wall of text goes in to some detail on the game-wide stat differences between 2-3k players and 5k+ players Please note that this is not meant to be an exhaustive analysis (pulling case studies, like the healing/min of Bounty Hunter, or the current GPM difference of riki in 2k vs 5k, is an encyclopedia unto itself), but it should illustrate how playstyle differences add up to produce very different game outcomes from the low to the high brackets.  *How to improve your numbers* cant be fully covered in a single post, but you [can check out my sidebar guide on learndota2 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/48oqqn/mentalgeneral_improvement_tips_using_chess/) for some checklist-style thoughts on this topic.  The trench is not just a question of individual actions **but a core failure to play the game efficiently.**  Data for further exploration can be found at www.dotabuff.com/heroes/meta and in YASPs benchmark feature, an excellent look at your global performance on key stats in a given game.

&nbsp;

**Bottom line up front / TL;DR: 5k+ Players play the entire game at a faster pace than other players**

Whether its moving to new farm, taking objectives, making rosh decisions, identifying proper positioning, using skills, or deciding which items to buy, the top 1% simply dont slow down.   For example, I saw !Attacker (nearly 9k) on Tinker the other day; he got a kill top, rearmed, went bottom and marched the wave, hit fountain, and returned top within 30s or less; a 2k player might have gotten the kill, but theres a great chance theyd go back to fountain, spend 10 seconds planning the next move, and miss the entire wave of creeps that the 9k swept up.  Every pause that a 2k takes is a hit to game efficiency where they should be doing something else.  You should always be ready and moving to the next item on an endless checklist of tasks, and thinking ahead to the next method to gain GPM and XPM, without also feeding that lead back to your opponents. DotA is not a game that is just against 5 human players, its against the ancient on each side of the map. Play against the whole enemy team, including their towers and creeps, not just the 5 heroes.

&nbsp;

**1) GPM and XPM** is much higher in the 5k bracket, even when considering losing teams

Take a look at the top 11 *differences in GPM* on carries between 5k+ and 2-3k.   **Keep in mind, these numbers include losing teams, this is strictly a measure of just how much faster paced a generic 5k player is over a 2-3k player.** At the extreme, compared to a 2.5k player, a *typical* 5k+ Naga siren has a full end-game item (or 2 cheaper items) over their counterparts at 30 minutes in to the game! Where the ~~2.5k would have rad+Manta+travels+Aquila, the 5k+ would have rad+manta+travels+Aquila+**Butterfly** (or heart, octarine, diffusal, etc.) by the *same point in the game!*

*edit: a number of people have pointed out my "Gold @ 30m" stat is potentially a poor extrapolation on this data.  I do agree I took a liberty here but I don't think it affects the overall validity of my point. It is probably a slight over-estimate of the actual NW difference, but it's hard to say since first 10/15m GPM of 5k+ carries (as noted in the excellent last hit analysis by /u/zeno) also means they spike much earlier than a lower tier player, but do take that number with a grain of NA-certified salt.*

**Hero**|**2-3k GPM**|**5k+ GPM**|**Average GPM 5k vs 2-3k**|**Total Gold difference in first 30m**
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:
**Naga Siren**| 476.3| 654.5|178.14|5344.2
**Alchemist**|678.8|812.3|133.53|4005.9
**Meepo**|488.0|611.9|123.97|3719.1
**Templar Assassin**|466.4|582.1|115.69|3470.7
**Anti-Mage**|541.8|652.0|110.23|3306.9
**Invoker**|446.5|553.7|107.21|3216.3
**Terrorblade**|503.8|602.8|98.91|2967.3
**Lone Druid**|443.0|539.5|96.47|2894.1
**Morphling**|476.1|567.1|90.96|2728.8
**Luna**|519.6|610.3|90.71|2721.3
**Sven**|519.4|610.1|90.71|2721.3

Key notes here to drive home the playstyle differences: 5 of the 10 core GPM differences are heroes directly requiring micro management, and of the remaining 6: Alchemist multiplies CS efficiency via Greed,  TA, AM, Sven, and Luna rely on varying types of spread attack damage, which requires care to ensure last hits on every creep in a wave, and Morphling requires manipulation of agi/str to farm efficiently and not die instantly to a gank.  Every single one of these carries relies on both precision and awareness from the player; not a tip or trick, but the *consistent ability to maximize their farm over a wide area and soak as much GPM as possible.* 2-3k players lack this consistent ability to execute on being in the right place at the right time to maximize farm, and fail to efficiently last hit in the mid game, often losing 2 or even 4 creeps per wave to spilled cleave damage or poor micromanagement they are **awful** at AoE last hitting in the mid game, and this is one of the most notable efficiency losses at lower brackets that isnt blatantly standing around doing nothing.

Notably, some hard carries like Chaos Knight show little variation from 2-3k to 5k (+25 GPM), and are generally considered weak at high tiers and strong at low tiers, thats because they lack the fast movement and flash farming of high-tier in-meta cores and rely on farming heroes; something much easier, and more natural, to 2-3k players, where more gold percentage is derived from heroes/objectives than from creeps.

&nbsp;

More subtly, lower tier players have a bizarre ability to avoid gaining experience.  Walking between lanes, getting halfway to a lane, switching ideas, and going elsewhere. Teleporting to a Mexican standoff at a tower, and **sharing XP 4 way when theres a free lane available**

**Hero**|**Average additional XPM, 5k+ vs. 2-3k**|**Total XP difference in 30m (approximate)**
:--|--:|--:
**Meepo**|+112.66|3379.8
**Templar Assassin**|73.42|2202.6
**Anti-Mage**|70.79|2123.7
**Lone Druid**|68.85|2065.5
**Sven**|63.24|1897.2
**Invoker**|60.55|1816.5
**Clinkz**|60.51|1815.3
**Storm Spirit**|56.88|1706.4
**Tiny**|56.19|1685.7
**Outworld Devourer**|52.29|1568.7

A key takeaway is that this is ~~1-2 levels per hero, and that critical level 11 is achieved much faster.  Again, keep in mind these are game-end statistics *(and include losing teams)* and STILL show a substantial increase, again indicating the **faster pace of play and more efficient positioning around map resources** compared to 2-3k players.

&nbsp;

**2) Deaths** 5k+ fight and die less, and their team deaths are distributed very differently

Eventually, you will fight the other team. However, 5k+ players do so less often (experiencing a team-wide average of 1.11 fewer deaths per hero, and therefore a game-wide average of 11 fewer, a ~~15% total reduction), and when they do, the carries are substantially less likely to die.  Carries represent ~~8.3% fewer of total deaths in 5k+ than in <2k dying 1.6 times less per game than their sub-2k counterparts this substantial difference interacts with GPM and XPM by reducing time off the map and lowering gold lost and gold fed. **remember that this includes both winning and losing teams, so we can reasonably conclude that the winning 5k carry dies even less!**

**Role**|**5k+ % of Avg. Deaths**|**5K+ % of Avg. Deaths**|**Average of &lt;2k Deaths**|**Average of 5k+ Deaths**|**Difference of Deaths**
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:
**Carry**|95.33%|87.01%|7.36|5.75|1.61
**Jungle**|91.58%|88.08%|7.07|5.82|1.25
**Mid**|100.74%|102.16%|7.78|6.75|1.03
**Offlane**|102.77%|108.34%|7.94|7.16|0.78
**Support**|104.15%|107.83%|8.05|7.13|0.92
**Total**|100.00%**|**100.00%**|**7.72**|**6.61**|**1.11**

Even more substantially, many 2-3k players complain about the comeback mechanics turns out theyre right to complain (but not because it's broken, because they're bad!) they feed almost 1k gold PER PLAYER more than a 5k+ team of the same composition mid heroes in particular at high tiers feed their lead back much less. This reflects exactly in the 2-3k tendency to pick a powerful snowballing mid and then have no idea what to do with it after minute 20 resulting in foolish pick-off attempts that feed their lead well after theyve dropped off from a solo stomping machine.

**Role**|**Average of <2k Gold Fed**|**Average of 5k+ Gold Fed**|**Difference of Gold Lost**
:--|--:|--:|--:
**Carry**|4964.36|4173.85|790.51
**Mid**|5107.35|4430.67|676.68
**Offlane**| 4874.06|4164.96|709.10
**Support**|4557.64|3739.22|818.42
**Grand Total**|**4847.61**|4088.54**|748.68**
**Teamwide total**|**24,059**|**20,245**|3814**

What this implies (and bears out as you climb) is that even of the deaths in 5k+, many more occur towards the beginning of the game, after which players become much more careful about protecting their networth advantages.  The fed gold is a full item worth of gold fed to the enemy over the 5k+ bracket

Of course, your team may insist on constantly fighting one of the things you cant do is just abandon your team to their fate, so making a decision to enter a fight is key for all roles.  More important is the idea of gold lost on death and fed to the enemy team; preserving your lead without feeding, and using unreliable gold instead of losing it on death can result in a massive change in GPM/Networth.  Picking heroes like Chaos Knight in order to fight early, is one way to handle aggression. *Efficiently* split pushing to trade towers and without losing your own life is another way to overcome this hurdle.  Both method require learning to fill your role very well.

&nbsp;

**3. Tower Damage Per Minute** is significantly higher in 5k+ games

If you look at objective damage per theres a big difference here too. **Again, this includes losing team tower damage, so the relatively marginal overall difference should be put in context that even while including losing teams, 5k+ carries are still doing substantially more damage to objectives than 2-3Ks!**

|Role|2K-3K Tower Damage/Minute|5K+ Tower Damage/Minute|Difference in TD/min,  2-3K vs. 5k+  
|---|--|--|--
|**Carry**|52.7|72.3|19.7
|**Jungle**|49.3|61.8|12.4
|**Mid**|29.6|36.4|6.9
|**Offlane**|19.4|18.1|-1.3
|**Support**|14.6|13.0|-1.6
|**Grand Total**|31.0|37.6|6.7

As we delve in to the data by hero we see that, as with GPM, two categories of heroes are notable.  One, heroes that already push substantially in lower brackets do so MUCH more efficiently at higher brackets, with TB in this meta being an utterly devastating force, delivering 40% more Tower damage per second in the upper tiers of play, and secondarily, a bunch of heroes that are gankers  notable for being going beyond godlike and still losing in 2k-3k (LS, TA, Huskar, Invoker).  In 5k+, those players have managed to find towers in addition to heroes, and follow up their ganks with powerful and fast pushes on objectives.

**Hero**| **2K-3K Tower Damage/Minute**| **5K+ Tower Damage/Minute**| **Difference in TD/minute, 2-3K vs. 5k+**
:--|--:|--:|--:
**Huskar**|45.0|103.0|58.0
**Lone Druid**|64.0|114.0|50.0
**Terrorblade**|103.0|147.0|44.0
**Meepo**|63.0|106.0|43.0
**Clinkz**|68.0|105.0|37.0
**Anti-Mage**|62.0|98.0|36.0
**Morphling**|60.0|96.0|36.0
**Lifestealer**|46.0|79.0|33.0
**Templar Assassin**|50.0|79.0|29.0
**Lycan**|90.0|116.0|26.0
**Drow Ranger**|84.0|110.0|26.0
**Invoker**|45.0|70.0|25.0
**Sven**|62.0|87.0|25.0
**Luna**|77.0|102.0|25.0

**Summary: what do I do about this?**

Theres a lot of subtle playstyle issues behind these numbers, but the core lesson should be clear: **accelerate everything you do,** When I say that I mean there should never be a point in the game where you have to think about what your next move is.  Literally every second you spend wondering which camp or lane to go to is a waste that 5k players have cut out.  Think about safety first, but secondarily, ACT get *near* a creep wave at least.  Get *near* a camp being farmed. See the guide I mention at the top of this post for some more practical checklist considerations.

&nbsp;

**A note on supports**

A lot of this focused on the core roles, as their stats are more easily tracked.  Interestingly, support players at 5k+ have **less** GPM/XPM, and, while they make up proportionally more of the teams deaths, they still have strictly fewer deaths despite that I **do not** recommend poverty supporting at 2k just to emulate the upper bracket, and the reason is with the core numbers discussed above the cores at 2-3k leave so many resources on the table that a support can pick up a ton of farm without ever coming in to conflict over resources with their carry.  As you rise, you learn to do more with less, i.e. have notable impact while 3 levels below your carry, without also feeding yourself away in every fight. Your cores will react better to stuns and slows, and use the farm you leave on the table for them more often.  Until you notice that happening, focus heavily on gaining key items and levels to save your idiots or turn teamfights, and work hard on proper ward positioning and self-positioning to avoid deaths and subtly direct your team to the right objectives.~|article
The Burning Antimage.|self.DotA2|~The DotA Chronicles, Page one.

The Legend of the burNIng Anti-Mage.

In Warcraft 3 Dota, burNIng was the one of the so called fun-names of Magina, who has come to be known as Anti-Mage. In honor of the greatest player of it in Warcraft 3 Dota. But in the Chinese communities, Anti-Mage was burNIng. Coming into Dota 2 in 2012, the legend of the burNIng Anti-Mage would live for a little longer than we thought it might.

The first time we saw burNIng's prowess on Anti-Mage in the world of Dota 2 was in the lower bracket of the international 2012. In a best of one match, DK 3rd picked Anti Mage into Darer's push lineup of Chen and Krobelus. burNIng ended the game 6/1/14, with 278cs in 28 minutes. This was the first glimpse the western world of DotA 2 had into the legendary Burning Anti-Mage.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejkQnvKYQeY Darer v DK.

Later into the tournament, DK played the almightly, and eventual winners iG in the lower bracket and picked up burNIng's Anti-Mage, to compete with Ferrari_430's Queen of Pain, and Zhou's Morphling. After a back and forth game, it was leaning to DK, with burNIng's Anti-Mage seeming unstoppable at an 8/0 score. iG took a rosh fight that would eventually dictate the end of the game. iG's charge into the pit was halted by DK's attempt to take the fight at the pit, ending in a total wipe of iG, and burNIng's Anti-Mage getting a triple kill. iG tapped out at 37 mins, with burNIng ending 12/0/8, with 659 GPM. DK would however go on to lose the series, with iG banning the Anti-Mage both games to take them through
to the losers bracket final.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct6xljXnOLo IG v DK

Fast forward a year and burNIng was back on the main stage with a new-look DK Squad. After a group stage of 10-4, DK defeated iG, and went on to face the invincible Alliance. Alliance were undefeated, 14-0 in the groups, and off a 2-0 win over LGD, had not even lost racks in the entire tournament play. Alliance took game 1 after a 55 Minute bloodbath, with Loda on Anti-Mage triumphing. In game 2, DK picked up the legendary burNIng Anti-Mage. Despite accruing an early lead with the Anti-Mage, Alliance still had the staples of their TI3 teams, the support naga, the Akke chen, the Bulldog Prophet. It was hard to believe in the Chinese being able to defeat their Swedish counterparts, and after a 4 hero wipe-out
from an EGM Song of the siren initiation, the game looked like it had turned in Alliance's favour, like it had for the entire tournament. After an Alliance high ground push was rebuffed, just like the year before, burNIng turned it in the pit. An EGM song initiation looked to crush DK in the pit after an Alch stun lands on two, but DK turned it with a quick Super roar out onto S4's Dragon Knight, and burNIng's Anti-Mage carving up side of Alliance, and with three to fall, they were rebuffed, and burNIng grabbed himself an Aegis. Alliance managed to hold against the aegis of DK, and pushed them out of the base. DK came right back, pushing back into the Swedish stronghold, as Burning marched up the high ground and
was forced into BKB'ing, Alliance popped the song from EGM and Netted him, with no means of help from his team, and no way to escape, the Alliance hold looked like it was going to work.

"He's still alive!"

With LD's famous words echoing through the hall, burNIng stood tall, manfighting against the side of Alliance, crushing them under the blades of the Anti-Mage, and for the first time in the tournament, Alliance were up against mega creeps at the 45 Minute mark. DK stormed the ruined castle for the final time, and they crushed through the last line of the Alliance defense, to bring them down. The favourites had finally lost a game at TI3. The entire of DK deserved massive respect, but the man who stood tall was the man behind the Anti-Mage.  11/2/9, 816 GPM. DK would go on to lose the series and once again, fall in the lower bracket of the International, but burNIng's performance would live long in the memory
of anyone who watched the series live. burNIng retired after the tournament, marking the end of one of the most famous, and most highly regarded players in the history of Dota.

A year later however, DK were back, and so was burNIng. But the meta had changed, so had DK. DK were completely changed into a legendary lineup, with the SEA representatives IceIceIce and Mushi, alongside the old support guard of LaNm, and X!!!, and with burNIng at the helm. For the style of play burNIng revelled in however, the slow farming into lategame, taking the fights when he wanted to, winning on his Spectre, his Anti-Mage and such. TI4 marked a deathball push meta, where heroes like Natures Prophet, Lycan, Death prophet and Pugna were stellar picks in the position one role. Despite this however, burNIng and DK advanced far into the tournament. DK after defeating LGD in the lower bracket,
sent there by a 2-0 loss against EG, they came up against future finalists, Vici Gaming. In game 1, DK pulled out the Anti-Mage trump card, but VG were prepared, playing a lineup with Leshrac and Pugna, looking to crush the lanes before burNIng could ever get to lategame. No space was given to burNIng, or Mushi's tinker in the game, with an early Razor aghs coming out, VG decimated the towers of DK, creating an enormous lead. burNIng holding on for what little farm he could get. Until they finally had a
chance. He jumped in, massacring the Pugna and Prophet of Vici Gaming, earning an Ultra kill in what was a miraculous teamfight with the help of the hex of Mushi. However, it wasn't enough. VG came right back, and crushed the base of DK under the sheer might of the split push, and another International had escaped burNIng. DK.burNIng once again announced his retirement after TI, alongside Xiao8, and rOtk.

Fast-Forward another year, and after a return in DAC 2015 with the old guard of Chinese Dota, all 3 returned to TI5, rOtk with his young EHOME squad, Xiao8 with his mighty LGD team, and burNIng Was not with team DK. For the first time, burNIng was with Invictus Gaming, the side that had defeated his DK squad in the International 2012. Alongside several members from that squad, Faith, Chuan, Ferrari_430, they came into TI5 as hopefuls, but after a terrible group stage score of 5-9, found themselves in the lower bracket, a familiar place for burNIng. In round one of the lower bracket, they faced MVP Hotsix, and defeated them easily. They then faced the might, and favourite for the tournament,
Team Secret. A wounded animal after their defeat to young EHOME in the upper bracket. iG turned to the burNIng Anti-Mage in the first game, changing up their draft from what looked like a burNIng gyro, to a mid gyro, last picking the Anti-Mage. The game however didn't go to script. Secret rolled over iG through the entire game, Arteezy's shadow fiend owning the game with S4's Storm Spirit. Accruing a 25k gold lead, they marched up to iG's high ground at 45 mins. iG held, superb play from Chuan and burNIng's
Anti-Mage did the unbelievable and held their racks against the might of Team Secret. Charging to the pit, iG took the roshan, and carved up two of Secret, seizing the moment, and knocking at Secret's front door. However, it was secret's turn to hold. They held the high ground several times before burNIng broke down
the drawbridge, Rapier in hand, tearing the structures of Secret to shreds, unstoppable, he ripped the throne apart, and a huge roar flowed around KeyArena. 8/1/7, 673cs, 756gpm.

"Unbelievable!"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b66Sv_taFs iG v Secret

As it happened all too often however for burNIng at TI, the opposition ended up taking the series, and burNIng spent time playing for VG. Moving to a 4 role, and seeing his team fail to qualify for TI, it looked like the legend had finally become just that, a memory faded into the past, remembered fondly, but still in the past. However, after returning to iG, with a reinvigorated squad, they won DAC 2017, and went onto the kiev major. In the new Swiss format, iG played OG, once again, a powerful favourite for the tournament in a three game series. After taking game one for iG, the Anti-Mage was pulled out. Could he still do it, after all this time?

11/1/9, 650cs, 45k net worth, and a thousand gold per minute.

I'm sure there are far more memories people have of the legend of the burNIng Magina, but these are the ones that stick in my head from DotA 2.

Thanks for reading!

Redeye: Poorly constructed BBC article about sexism in esports does more harm than good|slingshotesports.com||article esports
Team eHug - TI4 NA qualifier post-mortem.|self.DotA2|~What a ride! Our players gave it their best, but in the end, it was not meant to be. We wish the very best of luck to all the teams who made it to the qualifier playoffs. We at Team eHug look forward to becoming normal fans again, and we cant wait to watch the remaining games.

Whats next for the organization? We will sit down with our players and discuss the future. Our team will most likely be inactive until the end of TI4, but rest assured that we will be back as a new and improved eHug 2.0 soon.

Before we leave you tonight, we wanted to state the organizations stance on some of the drama that has been surrounding the team.

- What was the deal with the forfeit against Union Gaming in our very first game of the qualifiers?

One of our players (Cak3z) had a real-life career obligation that was arranged before the qualifier schedule was announced. We had asked for a rescheduling, but our request was denied. Our player tried his very best to make it, but he arrived 31 minutes past the start time, and the official rules state that a team whose members are not ready by 30 minutes past the start time must concede the game. This was just an unfortunate sequence of events. We fully accept the consequences, and firmly believe that neither the tournament organizers nor Cak3z did anything wrong.

The organizers are not obligated to honor rescheduling requests. It is a privilege and not a right for players to participate in this tournament, and it is completely reasonable to expect participants to free up their schedules to play. Furthermore, given the sheer number of parties involved and the tight time constraints, rescheduling games would be logistically difficult, if not downright impossible. We would also like to note that even if another teams request is honored, it does not mean that there is any requirement to honor every other teams request.

As for Cak3z, his competitive spirit and dedication to the team should not be in question. From the very beginning, he has agreed to play for us despite not receiving a salary nor the benefits of the gaming house. Even when the partners were openly auditioning for his replacement, he continued to show up to every game whenever we needed him. He really wanted to make it to the UG game, but alas, real life obligations prevented him from doing so. He was surely bummed out more than anybody that the forfeit occurred. The team would not have gotten as far as it did without his stellar performance, and we are very grateful for his service.

- Are we mad at Team Liquid for losing against Union Gaming?

Our players were shocked, exhausted, and justifiably upset when this happened, as it meant that the playoff spot that they thought they had secured was suddenly up for grabs. Some of them publicly vented that frustration, but then they quickly complied with our request to cease doing so. However, those public displays had already made the rounds - even resulting in a front-page Reddit post titled ehug are MAD - and many were speculating on our feelings on the matter.

We as an organization wish to make our official stance abundantly clear - Team Liquid did not do anything illegal, nor can they be blamed for our failure to advance. It is completely reasonable for their players to take it easy after a bunch of grueling matches and not reveal any strategies for the playoffs. They earned the right to be in that position by being a superior team. It is also a very serious allegation (not to mention, disrespectful to Union Gaming) to claim that TL purposely lost the game. Their players are professionals and competitors, and no team should have to face such scrutiny, especially in the absence of evidence and motive.

We completely sympathize with our players for being frustrated and angry when they realized that they had to play more games after an absolutely brutal day. We apologize to those who took offense to those displays.

- What the hell was with our last Reddit post begging for help?

This was just an idiotic move on the part of the eHug partners. We did not consult with the players beforehand, and ended up embarrassing them in the process by appearing to undermine their professional status. Our goal was to attract a bit of publicity for the team, stir up some interesting discussions about the game, and perhaps even find some original ideas. We did not intend for it to be construed as a sign of desperation or a pathetic plea for help. As soon as we realized the damage, it was too late. We apologized to the players, who were justifiably confused and humiliated. Theres no way around it. We really messed up - the post was in poor taste.

With that said, we do wish to thank all of our supporters and well-wishers who overwhelmed us with their desire to help. Though we dont think any of the submitted ideas were actually seriously considered, they were all read and appreciated. You guys may not be the best players or strategizers, but you certainly are the warmest and most helpful.

We want to conclude this post by thanking the Reddit community for making all of this happen. We will continue to try our best to bring you a team that you can root for. <3

Good luck and have fun,
Team eHug

Forbes Reviews Dota 2: 'Dota 2' Review: A Multiplayer Masterpiece, 9/10|forbes.com||article
My Findings on the Arrow/Jaren Case|self.DotA2|~Hi everyone, I'm Tiffani "Oling" Lim. You might have known me as the manager for the Titan Dota 2 squad. As for now, I'm just an active member in the SEA Dota scene, and I'd like to share some of my findings regarding this Arrow / Jaren case here.  
  
**Just a quick list for your reference:**

* Arrow Gaming Players: DDZ, Lance, Matteru, Mozun & Xiangzaii.


* Jaren = Arrow Gaming manager


* Xiaoting = DDZ's girlfriend


* Hishiko = Lance's girlfriend



Let's begin.
  


___
**I - Early Investigations**
  
A while ago I learnt from [Ren](http://www.reddit.com/user/PacificRen) & a few others of the possibility that Arrow Gaming is also implicated in the series of matchfixing incidents in SEA. I wasn't actively involved in the investigations back then, just helping out when Dota2Lounge asked me some questions about Arrow Gaming and their gfs. 
  
At that point in time D2Lounge didn't find the evidence available conclusive yet because the bets were placed via the gfs' accounts (and not the players'), and the Arrow players found out that BTS was thinking of replacing Arrow Gaming in the Summit 2 as well. But both BTS & D2Lounge were careful and hesitant about this so nothing was released or announced yet.
  


___
**II - Ren's Published Findings**
  
Finally 2 days ago, Ren decided to publish his findings via [this Reddit thread](http://bit.ly/1nu6OF5). The way he did it was just to present the facts (bets by the gfs) and let the community judge for itself if Arrow Gaming really did participate in matchfixing.

Prior to this many were witnesses that both gfs posted angry FB statuses in an attempt to discredit such claims, but as the Reddit thread surfaced all such statuses were deleted. The members involved and their gfs fell silent on social media.
  


___
**III - The Cover-up Attempt**
  
Around 12am SGT yesterday I was chatting with a friend regarding this incident, and I found out that she was approached by DDZ's gf earlier on for help in creating a coverup story & fabricating evidence. And soon enough at 3am this [thread](http://bit.ly/1t7Ekmp) appeared on Reddit, and I was really angry that the players would actually go to the extent of creating more lies to cover up for what they did. 

The Reddit post was posted by the user "ArrowDDZ" & was shared on DDZ & Xiaoting's Facebook wall. In the post "DDZ" not only denies any involvement in "322" activities, supported it's claims with fabricated pieces of evidence, but also launched a mini-section with personal attacks on Ren's betting history. 

That's the reason why I was quick to point out that the evidence presented in the thread was fake ([tweet](http://bit.ly/1w1miDh)). And quickly enough, people began to realize problems with the chatlogs, and here are some that I've compiled: [1](http://i.imgur.com/Ksw5pSu.png), [2](http://i.imgur.com/mafmC54.gifv), [3](http://i.imgur.com/SUDMplD.png).

I presented my findings to the tournament organizers involved too. And around 4pm Jaren released a post on the Arrow Gaming Facebook Page wall ([post](http://bit.ly/1nxIsKx)), claiming that the Arrow Gaming management had nothing to do with the coverup attempt. The post was deleted yesterday night for some reason.

And around the same time I received a message from my friend & DDZ's girlfriend - the players wanted to make a public apology which includes a confession against Jaren, stating that Jaren coerced them into this cover-up scheme. I agreed to help because I saw no harm in offering a public apology, but I did not decide on which story to believe yet regarding the issue of who came up with the idea to cover-up the truth.
  


___
**IV - The Players' Statement**
  
DDZ wrote his statement in Chinese, and his gf translated the message into English. It can be found on DDZ's Facebook wall [here](http://on.fb.me/1CPoexC). Screenshot available [here](http://i.imgur.com/EkkXwc9.png).

Key points presented in the statement:

* DDZ and Lance admitted that they're guilty of matchfixing
* The players as well as the two gfs involved offered their apologies to the tournament organizers
* "*we approached our management for help and we were advised to cover up for the sake of our reputation*"
* The Reddit post was written by Jaren in DDZ's name
  


___
**V(a) - Jaren, Xiaoting & Hishiko's Involvement in the Cover-up**
  
At the same time as the rest were working on the statement, Hishiko was also sending some screenshots of her chats with Jaren to the tournament organizers. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/hri8FFt.jpg) is a compilation of everything she sent.

The first thing highlighted in red implied Xiangzai's involvement in the matchfixing itself. I'll talk about this in the later section titled "The Matchfixing".

The second thing highlighted in red and basically the conversation from then onwards showed that Jaren was not only aware of the cover-up, but was also part of the few who came up with it. I managed to obtain more proof about this [here](http://i.imgur.com/4NH9fO6.jpg). This was a screenshot of the chat between Jaren and Hishiko on Skype that clearly shows the involvement of both parties in the cover-up story on Reddit.

Later on when I talked to Jaren about it he admitted to participating in the cover-up, but claimed that Xiaoting was the one who came up with the idea. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/Erqftcd.png)'s a screenshot of our chat about it.

Here are the proofs he sent, with screenshots of FB chats between Jaren & Xiaoting, with [Jaren asking Xiaoting](http://i.imgur.com/iAAFfE8.png) to "cough up good excuse" in order to cover up the crime, and the latter coming up with the idea of falsifying evidence later on: [1](http://i.imgur.com/cVUWE0l.png) and [2](http://i.imgur.com/8DLELP6.jpg).
  


___
**V(b) - My Own Views Regarding Said Parties' Involvements in the Cover-up**
  
For the matter of the cover-up itself, my view is that both Xiaoting and Jaren have plenty of reasons to want to salvage their reputation from this incident - Jaren is the owner of Dota Talk and quite a number of SEA Dota 2 tournaments, and Xiaoting herself is a well-known personality in the Malaysian gaming scene. I was also told that Xiaoting was really worried about DDZ's reputation, because the matchfixing was discovered via her Steam account and she felt guilty about it. So given the evidence, I'd believe that both parties as well as Hishiko are involved and were just working together for the cover-up. 

Regarding the players, I really do believe what they said in the statement of being "*afraid and lost*", "*didnt know what to do and how to react*". I do have some screenshots given to me by their Assistant Team Manager showing that all 5 players met up with Jaren shortly before the cover-up post surfaced, but there is no evidence linking any of them directly to the Reddit post. For the case of DDZ's Facebook account sharing the Reddit post, I do know that both Xiaoting & [Jaren](http://i.imgur.com/TZmwSVa.png) have had access to his Facebook account.

As for Jaren, Xiaoting and Hishiko, I'd say it doesn't really matter who came up with the idea but as long as all of them had the motivation to do so and the evidence showed their involvement, I believe none of the parties can or should be considered innocent in this.
  


___
**VI - The Matchfixing**
  
I noticed in [this](http://i.imgur.com/JD5mOjQ.jpg) screenshot of a chat between Hishiko & Jaren, that Xiangzai ("xz") might have also been part of the matchfixing itself. So I decided to investigate further about the involvement of members other than DDZ & Lance.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/nkbMiNJ.png)'s what Xiaoting said earlier today in a FB chat group regarding the involvement of other players.

Later on I had a [FB conversation with Matteru](http://i.imgur.com/MWhCq6g.png). In the chat he confessed that the entire Arrow Gaming team planned the matchfixing together, and that it is NOT linked to anyone from the Philippines. 

Here's a quick translation of the chatlog:

>Tiffani: Hi, want to ask if you have any evidence of you guys participating in the 322? you or xiangzai/mozun
>Matteru:  I can't give evidence now, but we can admit it, after all we planned this together.
>Tiffani: Ok. Is this related to the PH people? Or did you guys come up with it on your own?
>Matteru: We came up with it on our own
>Tiffani: Ok thanks, be sure to forward me any screenshots of bets that you guys might have.

So I believe that all 5 players were indeed involved in the planning of and the matchfixing itself.
  


___
**VII - Jaren's Threats**
  
Following the release of the players' statement on Facebook yesterday evening, Jaren sent them threats via FB chat and for some verbally - for more information you can read it up in the 2p article [here](http://bit.ly/ZMrYmT).  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/1orFyWv.jpg)'s his threat via Facebook message to Lance.

[Here](http://on.fb.me/1wlKvRt)'s Jaren's post on the Arrow Gaming Facebook Page once again in response to the statement, alongside DDZ & Lance's [termination letter](http://i.imgur.com/ufw80Ut.jpg).

Jaren has also been threatening the players and their girlfriends in a [Facebook group chat](http://i.imgur.com/4dSaTIU.jpg) since this morning, coercing them into supporting his version of the story and thus clearing his name.
  


___
**VIII - Jaren, Dota Talk & his Fake "Official" Facebook Pages for Dota 2 Teams**

You might be wondering why this section is included here - I feel the community & public deserves to know, and it might also help in your understanding of Jaren and his influence in SEA.

I've been doing quite a lot of investigations on the series of fake "Official" Facebook pages of Dota 2 teams for a while now. The reason why I started to look into it was when I was travelling with the then-Titan Dota 2 squad at TI4, on the bus I saw that Jaren (there as Arrow's manager) was posting on the infamous "[Fake iG page](http://on.fb.me/1tI0Va2)" as one of the admins.

The fake pages are known for spreading questionable/false information to the Dota 2 community by acting like the organizations they impersonate: [1](http://i.imgur.com/w4HrqZX.png), [2](http://i.imgur.com/2U8q0Q1.png), [3](http://i.imgur.com/iOMiJ80.png), [4](http://i.imgur.com/qvtd2J2.png). 

They often share pay-per-click ([1](http://i.imgur.com/baK6uo2.png, [2](http://i.imgur.com/zbrdQ2z.png)) and ad links ([1](http://i.imgur.com/l6Rlbfe.png), [2](http://i.imgur.com/9OXw5b5.png), [3](http://i.imgur.com/dAizc50.png)) on their pages, and blatantly [plagiarize contents](http://i.imgur.com/bfgBTw9.png) for that purpose. 

Most of the pages in the same network have a large number of SEA followings ([1](http://i.imgur.com/1uupwR3.png, [2](http://i.imgur.com/i3IJM3o.png)), so it is easy for the admins to spread and share information, regardless of whether they are true or false, within the SEA or greater Dota 2 community.

As I investigated further I realized that the pages were all similar & inter-linked in a way, i.e. they would share the same contents/links and [share](http://i.imgur.com/9eJ226w.png) their own pages around, and as a result it wasn't hard to get the entire list. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/PP6EDJa.png) is the list of fake pages. 


And here are some screenshots proving Jaren's involvement in them: [Proof 1](http://i.imgur.com/Cd45wT3.png), [Proof 2](http://i.imgur.com/RABbTo0.png), [Proof 3](http://i.imgur.com/c5ABdFJ.png).

These screenshots were obtained from their [open Facebook group](http://on.fb.me/1wsot1r), the "Admins Centre", which [controls this network of fake pages](http://i.imgur.com/nIITNuP.png).

With the large followings Jaren is able to use these pages to manipulate the community to an extent, and him together with Nelson (owner and founder of the fake iG page) makes money from these [pay-per-click websites](http://i.imgur.com/d7nFYjf.png).

And following Ren's Reddit thread, [this](http://i.imgur.com/FAe4ii2.png) was posted on the fake iG page. And this morning, we see [this post](http://i.imgur.com/q7Kmxl5.png) that most likely came from Jaren, who's one of the admins.
  

I definitely do not believe in impersonation, plagiarism, manipulation of information & also earning money off the community who follows your page thinking you're representing their favourite team. I have also told by reliable sources that giveaways held on his Dota Talk pages were mostly given to ghost accounts made by Jaren himself, and he would sell the products from sponsors for money.  Earlier on I've also confirmed with Sharky that Jaren has not paid out the prize money for the AMD D2M League which was in March. 
  


___
**IX - Lastly...**
  
 Here's a summary of my entire post:

* The 5 players themselves, namely DDZ, Lance, Mozun, Xiangzaii and Matteru planned and committed the crime of matchfixing.
* The girlfriends Xiaoting and Hishiko were involved as accomplices in the matchfixing itself, and later on as part of the team that worked on covering-up for the crime.
* Jaren was part of, or led the cover-up, even though he denied his involvement initially.
* Jaren owns and/or administrates a huge network of fake pages on Facebook, and we know from there that Jaren will and can manipulate others around him to achieve his goals. His continuous involvement in those fake pages also suggests an openness to deceit and manipulation that brings his character into question.
  

So I think it is fair to say that for the Arrow "322" incident itself, none of the involved parties are innocent. The tournament organizers and sponsors can decide what to do with the players. As for Jaren, I'll leave it up to the community to decide what we should do with him.


I know by exposing Jaren & his fake pages it's equivalent to attaching a target on my forehead, who knows if he might start throwing false claims or personal attacks my way. But despite all that I believe people deserve to know the truth. And the SEA scene will definitely be a much better place without people like Jaren, the Arrow Gaming organization, the fake pages and Dota Talk.

  
  

**Note**: I've also compiled a list of the real team pages for all SEA & Chinese teams with the help of Mali, Staka & other SEA managers/captains, and I will be posting a thread of the compilation on Reddit soon. Let's hope that despite the lack of help from Facebook, such fake pages will not prevail.~|article esports

Team CDEC: A Brief History|self.DotA2|~Hello everyone, your resident bilingual DotA fan here, this time bringing you an article on Team CDEC, the dark horse of TI5 that has brought us many exciting games and pulling several unexpected upsets. CDEC entered TI5 as a relatively unknown team through the wildcard qualifiers, having placed second to EHOME during the main qualifiers, but have miraculously [cruised into the Grand Finals](/spoiler)

&nbsp;

CDECs performance in this International can only be described as astounding, but it is quite unfortunate that the majority of the western populace know so little about this team  including the casters and analysts themselves. Ive taken the opportunity to do some additional research on the team, and wrote this short article to help break down the language barrier that stifles the appreciation of talents and good DotA around the world.

[Sgamer](http://bbs.sgamer.com/forum-44-2.html)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&nbsp;

**CDEC: A New Challenger**

&nbsp;

At its inception, CDEC was an inhouse league started by LGD to spot new talent in the community. CDECs full name is **C**hina **D**ota **E**lite **C**ommunity  which is an inhouse league similar to IXDL in NAdota, minus the trolling, flaming, ixmike and toxicity. From this league, LGD selected five players to assemble into a junior practice team, known as LGD.CDEC. After a couple of roster changes, the team ultimately departed from its role as LGDs junior team, setting out as an independent entity. 

&nbsp;

In terms of team prowess, CDEC is certainly not lacking in terms of skill  every one of its members are ladder-crowning pubstars in both DotA 1 and 2 (sitting at around 7200 mmr), whose skills are recognized amongst the Chinese community elite. However, a team comprising of people born and molded from cancerous ranked games would naturally suffer from difficulties in teamwork and coordination.

&nbsp;

**Growth of a Team**

&nbsp;

CDECs progress into the dominating team it is now was not without its hiccups. A few months into its formation, their core star player Maybe left CDEC for LGD in March 2015, a move (or "promotion") that did not come to much surprise given CDECs role as LGD's junior team, as well as their mediocre competitive performance record. This resulted in a brief period of turmoil where CDEC had to find new players as well as shuffle existing roles.

&nbsp;

Their first strong performance was at G-League 2015, which took place in June 2015, where they placed 2nd, losing to LGD 3-2 in the finals. They were noted for unique picks such as bounty hunter, as well as scoring resounding 2-0 wins against Vici Gaming in the Dota 2 Champions League.

&nbsp;

The CDEC we see now has completely resolved those issues  were looking at a team that thinks, acts and executes as a single cohesive unit. Each player knows their roles, their priorities and pushes their hero synergies to the limit. In their games, we see Agressif on the frontlines protected by the selfless supports, Shikis solid midlane that helps his team transition smoothly into the midgame, and Xzs offlane thats steadily improving with his initiations and clutch plays. While CDEC may not have the most mechanically skilled individuals, the team is definitely no slouch against the Tier 1 teams on the international arena.

&nbsp;

**Road to TI5**

&nbsp;

Experience is often the bane of every newly forged team. CDEC sorely lacked experience facing against foreign teams, having played exclusively within China thus far. To even enter the TI5 playoffs, CDEC had to play against 2 western teams with completely different playstyles and meta approach to the game. 

&nbsp;

How did CDEC overcome this obstacle? The solution was simple  play the CDEC style. By sticking to their trademark aggressive clashing, they pushed their unique meta into their draft, execution and game plan. For them, it didnt matter if they won or lost a game, the result would still be acceptable. This positive mentality is crucial for a new team, and is a form of sportsmanship that should be valued and respected. It was with this iron confidence in their own playstyle that allowed CDEC to calmly advance through the group stages, while making adjustments to ensure they stay ahead of the meta. This has allowed them to bring out their best no matter who the opponent is, be it Empire with their notoriously strong teamfight prowess, or the disciplined LGD with their calculated plays.

**Player Tidbits:**

(credit to /u/arbipher, /u/rozzerhmq, /u/kaelmela and /u/LuluInDisguise for accuracy)

1: Agressif - 

Joined CDEC at its inception, and has been playing the carry position since. Used to be notoriously strong with blink-reliant carries such as Brewmaster, and is known to 'start a rampage the moment he gets his blink dagger'. His Chinese moniker means Dominance.

&nbsp;

2: Shiki - 

A pubstar known as the Ranked MMR King, CDEC is Shikis second team, and he is known to practice frequently with EHOME.Cty (which explains their similar playstyles). Cty, Maybe and Shiki are rumored to be the three disciples of the legendary YaphetS. Both his English and Chinese moniker are a reference to an anime character "Shiki Ryogi"

&nbsp;

3: Xz  

Previously from  Team LaiG, Xz used to be a mid player known for aggressive and flashy plays. After joining CDEC, he initially had some trouble transitioning to the offlane role, but is quickly adapting and meshing with the team. His Chinese moniker is "Ash Ketchum" from Pokemon.

&nbsp;

4: Garder  (

Another of CDECs founding members, Garder has been one of the most consistent support players in the Chinese scene, and was known for his stellar plays with Earthshaker. His Chinese moniker means "I love Earthshaker"

&nbsp;

5: Q  

Previously considered a poor support and CDECs weakest link, Qs support skill has seen a marked improvement over the last few months, quickly silencing past critics and establishing his ability to make clutch plays and maximize his impact in the game. His Chinese moniker means "Gimme the ball, Capt!"


&nbsp;

Hope the DotA community finds this helpful - I'll work on translating some of the Chinese players' interviews in the meantime!

Easy is the New Hard - The 7.00 Offlane|howdoiplay.com||article
Harmonic oscillations in stable spirit bear attack frequencies|self.DotA2|~The harmonic oscillations at which a unit engaged in a stable attack pattern performs discrete actions can be modeled to demonstrate counterintuitive increases to probabilistic event frequencies at inverse relationships to the waveform frequency, due to the short term thresholds before any feasible scenario breaks down in real-world application. By relating the harmonic relationship of the two waveforms, we can determine target attack speeds which are detrimental to exceed, and the use of monte carlo models can provide an estimation of lost utility conferred from this extra attribute.

In this article, we consider the case in which a Spirit Bear has at 4 skill points invested and has access to the skill Entangling Claws and then further examine the same case with addition of the item Skull Basher. By comparing the relative cooldowns of these procedurally invoked mechanics to attack frequencies given as a function of +% Attack Speed as a sum of item and skill effects, weighted by the constant base attack time, we can determine specific and optimal harmonic frequencies above which bash and/or entangle have less chance to proc.

A level 4 Spirit Bear has a base attack time of 1.45s. Attack Speed multipliers in the dota 2 engine are constrained to [-0.8,6] at [-80%,+500%] respectively, giving upper and lower bounds of Actions Per Second (hereafter "APS") of [7.25,0.24166]. In normal usage, a Spirit Bear has +40% ASPD from Rabid, combined with any item bonuses, for a baseline of 1.0357 APS. Entangling Claws has a 20% event trigger chance on 5.00 cooldown, and Skull Basher has a 25% event trigger chance on 2.3 cooldown. Cooldowns begin instantaneously upon event trigger and resolve before the exact engine tick upon which they would expire; a 5.00 cooldown started at 0.00 can trigger again at earliest at 5.00. Thus lower order harmonic frequencies of each trigger cooldown can be expressed as the discrete

    Cooldown / N

EX. The 2.3 frequency of Skull Basher produces harmonics at N=1,2,3,4 of [2.300, 1.1500, 0.7667, 0.5750] APS respectively. We can then express the relationship of APS to ASPD as:

    APS = 1.45 / (1 + ASPD)

    ASPD = (1.45 - APS) / APS

Thus a 0.575 APS is given by 1.5217 ASPD, or +152.17%

In this example, we can see that resolving the discrete integer parameter of ASPD produces a definitive threshold from which the APS passes the harmonic. At +152% ASPD, we have a 0.5754 APS. At +153% ASPD, we have a 0.5731 APS. The meaningful loss of utility derives from the cooldowns of the Skull Basher being only slightly exceeded in frequency, when stable scenarios of attack patterns in Dota do not exist for prolonged periods. At 0.5731 APS provided by +153% ASPD, if the first attack occurs at 0.0000, the fourth attack will complete at 2.2925. If one attack triggers the mechanical event of Bash for Skull Basher, without additional delay introduced to the system, there must elapse four consequent attacks before the fifth one can now trigger it again. Yet with the lesser frequency of a 0.5754 APS provided by the +152% ASPD, the fourth attack falls upon 2.3016. This fourth attack can trigger the event mechanic of Bash, as it has occurred after the cooldown has elapsed. These two APS frequencies have only a relative difference of +/-0.4% for derived values such as Damage Per Second (hereafter "DPS"), yet the difference in frequency of potential triggers has increased from 5 cycles of attacks at total 2.8656 APS to 4 cycles of attacks at total 2.3016 APS. This is an increase of +24.50%, a relatively significant increase for a relatively insignificant drawback in other considerations like DPS. It is trivially assumed that as we are exceeding the threshold by only a minute value, the point at which the faster frequency wraps around for an extra attack is not a reasonable concern for real-world applications.

[Figure 1: A table of Nth order harmonics for the basic cooldowns of 5.0 and 2.3, with corresponding APS and ASPD values.](http://i.imgur.com/L9n9rjm.png)

Slightly more involved is the triple harmonic of APS, Bash Cooldown and Entangling Claws considered together. Under previous patches, this cohered to a simple harmonic upon discrete 1.0 second intervals as Bash had a 2.0 cooldown, reducing to an LCD of 1 and LCM of 10, but with the frequency of 2.3 cooldown, this produces irregular intervals, an LCM of 115. As such, there exist no meaningful values at which harmonics occur within the ASPD constraints of [-0.8,5] to a significantly close degree.

Actual results are involved to model mathematically due to both the attachment of Bash and Entangling Claws mechanic triggers to random chance, as well as the modification of trigger chances by pseudorandom distribution for Skull Basher's Bash ability- an attribute not shared by Entangling Claws. To detail estimated utility of given APS vs relative triggers, a Monte Carlo simulation run over a large number of interations provides an accurate model of the drop in trigger frequency associated with exceeding harmonic resonances.

[Figure 2. Monte Carlo simulation of Bash and Entangling Claws independent event occurrences in 20.00 seconds of continuous attacking](http://i.imgur.com/1hn9jWB.png)

[Figure 3. Simulation of 200.00 second trials.](http://i.imgur.com/lT54lsx.png)

Calculations based upon static frequencies for given APS are contingent upon continuous attacking against an immobile target or one requiring no additional movement beyond the actionable portion of attack frequency of a Spirit Bear, be it post-backswing or animation canceling. In real-world scenarios this system is unstable and quickly collapses due to external factors, be it repositioning or disables, or implicit constraints such as a bashed target becoming deceased. To some degree these scenarios may appear contrived, but hedging against this is the self-stabilizing application of Bash / Entangling Claws as immobilizing targets, in turn granting continuous ability to full frequency of attacks. To what degree this can occur in any application is not quantifiable, but holds significant potential for optimization.~|article
An analysis of GMOs in DotA2: are players cautious of picking a genetically modified hero?|self.DotA2|~**TL:DR:Obviously gnetically modified heroes are picked less often than their counterparts, and perform slightly worse overall.**

Public perception is an important driver of consumer choices.  Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are a timely and relevant example of this phenomenon.  There is a growing sentiment among shoppers to prefer all-natural foods, while products that are processed, filled with hard-to-pronounce chemicals, or are genetically modified are met with hesitation.  It is possible that this trend is not limited to food choices, and therefore, I pose the question: **do DotA2 players avoid picking obviously genetically modified heroes?**

To begin to address this, further explanation of GMOs is required.  In the most basic sense of the term, a GMO is any organism which has had its genetic material altered.  Im not sure exactly how this process occurs, but it is clear from many [examples](http://i.imgur.com/8dJxsB4.png) that it [involves](http://i.imgur.com/LCWn06x.png) the [injection](http://i.imgur.com/V02vUSp.png) of ([usually](http://i.imgur.com/b5uWsae.png)) bright [colored](http://i.imgur.com/vnpDK6O.png) [liquids](http://i.imgur.com/ovf56bt.png) directly into [fruits](http://i.imgur.com/7jtUH1R.png) via an [over-sized](http://i.imgur.com/RuI6jcB.png) syringe, which can result in an [evil hybrid](http://i.imgur.com/O0huAv9.png).  For further explanation I spoke to an expert at my college, a professor of Theological Biology.  They offered this concise explanation: You can think of a GMO as really any living thing that has had its DNA base pairs (or A, T, C, and Gesus) changed in a way that changes its Intended Path.  Asked if syringes with colorful liquids are commonly used for this, More often than not.

It is worth mentioning that there are varying degrees to which organisms are modified.  One method, to which the public is particularly wary, involves inserting another species DNA into the genome of another.  For example, tomatoes and strawberries have been injected with fish genes to protect them from freezing!  I know what youre thinkingsounds gross!  Who would want a fishy strawberry?  From my understanding, the taste isnt altered, and only the added benefit of temperature resistance is conferred.  This raises another relevant question to DotA2: **are genetically modified heroes at any advantage over non-GMO heroes?**

To set out answering the above two questions, we first need a list of GMO heroes.  For this analysis, I am choosing to focus on heroes that obviously contain genetic material from two species, the type of GMO the public is most concerned over.  To this end, I chose to exclude any uncertainties such as: anthropomorphic heroes (Ursa, Earthshaker, Tiny, etc.), demons or ghosts (such as Bane), and separate races (Ogres, the Skywrath, Slithereen, etc.).  I have compiled a list of potential GMO (clearly two species) heroes below:



Hero| Species Combination| Can naturally breed?| Two species GMO?| 
---|---|----|----|----
Centaur Warrunner| Human and horse|X| | text
Dragon Knight| Human and dragon| X| | text
Enchantress| Human and deer| X| | text
Leshrac| Human and goat| X| | text
Lone Druid| Human and bear| X| | text
Lycan| Human and wolf| X| | text
Magnus| Mammoth and ~~~~giant~~~~ Rhinoceros | Unlikely|  (tentative)| text


With an established list of likely two species GMO heroes, data for matches played and won were collected from dotabuff.com.  The comparisons seen in the table below were made between our group of seven GMO heroes and all the rest. Additionally, a second all other heroes group was tested that got rid of high picked outlier heroes Pudge, Sniper, and Phantom Assassin.   



Table 2| GMO Heroes| All other heroes| All other heroes minus outliers
---|---|----|----
**Total number of heroes**| 7| 103| 100
**Total number of times played**| 346,421,468| 8,459,488,034| 7,772,529,509
**Average number of times played**| 49,488,781| 82,130,952   (39.70% higher)| 77,725,295 (36.32% higher) 
**Number of matches won**| 167,839,103| 4,184,156,016| 3,847,723,338 
**Average win rate**| 48.45%| 49.46%| 49.50%

**From the above results, I conclude the significantly lower pick rate of GMO heroes is a result of players hesitant attitudes towards genetically-meddled two species abominations.**  While the pick rates mirror public perceptions of food-related GMOs, there does not appear to be an advantage for GMO heroes in terms of win rate.  In fact, GMO heroes win games at a rate one percent lower than other heroes, suggesting that their modifications were either faultily done, or were not specifically used to better the hero in question, but rather produce an unnatural being to satisfy a twisted curiosity.

In conclusion, this pilot study offers the first reported evidence of genetically modified heroes in DotA2, and shows that players are hesitant to pick these engineered two species hybrids.  **Further classification and study is needed for other heroes excluded from these analyses to establish additional lines of evidence and to explore this pattern in more detail.**  The ideas presented here are not absolute; I welcome others opinions and thoughts about this sensitive political topic.

[Background] The History of Pendragon by TZJinzo.|youtube.com||article
The Glimpse - A Look Back on this Week in Dota 2 - January Week 2|self.DotA2|~Hey Now everybody! Welcome to The Glimpse, a new weekly /r/dota2 series in which I attempt to sum up for you all of the best that our subreddit had to offer this week. I get it, not everyone has time to sit underneath the glorious faucet of /new and wait to [](/flair-techies). That's cool, here's what you might have missed this week. 


So how are we going to do this? This is the beta for Glimpse. Currently I am compiling this list by pulling top scoring links daily, and sorting them by how they are tagged. Because of this someone can look at just Dota content, or jut eSports posts. To dig a little deeper we are also going to be sorting underneath our two umbrellas by organizing the posts by tags. In addition to the links to the original posts, I will give my best editorial of what's going on.  

Some things to keep in mind: This is a proof of concept and a beta. This project is open to change to your feedback, so feel free to talk about what you would like to see done, or done differently. Also I am curating this list myself, so while I think I grabbed everything that someone might deem important, It's entierly possible that I missed something. Don't hate me if I did, just go ahead and add it to the comments if you feel strongly. Alright. Here we go.

####Hidden Gem  
I would like to take some time in this piece to highlight a discussion, or discussions, that were of really high quality, but did not receive the up votes it might have deserved. While many people are quick to complain about the content here, it is often the case that people make great things, or pour their heart and soul into a post, only for it to not get the upvotes it deserves.   

While Fear might hold the moniker for partaking in Old Man Doto, we are not all angst male teens around these parts. /u/True_Zume started a lovely discussion with thoses who a little bit closer to their AARP membership status when he posted looking for [other /r/dota2 playerswho are over 30 years old.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2scm9t/34_year_old_player_herejust_curious_how_many_30/)


####LOL Comment   
We have some smart and funny posters around this part.  Here's to those who made us giggle this week.   

Now I thought about adding this section about 15 minutes ago in the shower. With that in mind I really haven't been saving the things that made me chuckle this week. So I figured we would keep it classy and start off this week with a [dick joke](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2ssbe8/a_visual_guide_to_the_shape_of_qops_ult/cnsesmt).

Entity Gaming's Manager statement about Ar1se|self.DotA2|~From the manager from the other thread:

Arise situation summary. What he is going around telling is partly true but not the entire story. I will try to explain in short as possible. Player A=A tier 1 famous player

Original Lineup is supposed to be Arise, Noia, Hestje, Job, Player A

Arise says he cannot play with player A. And the rest of the team feels arise is a better fit for the team. Player A is told he doesn't have a spot in the team anymore. And luk is recruited.

A week later everyone except Ar1se reach the bootcamp. Arise is supposed to reach a week later.

Suddenly panic sets in. Can I make it in SEA? Its so stacked now. Even Forevs new team is in SEA now. My brain tells me yes but my gut tells me no.

We speak on call for an hour. I convince him to take the leap of faith. He says yes.

Next few days all messages from me and the teammates are ignored while selfies are uploaded on facebook.

Finally he confirms on Thursday he is ready to fly on Tuesday i.e today. I ask for his passport copy and next day hes missing again.

Teammates say fuck it. Hes in 2 minds again and his mood swings are too much. Lets ask player A again if he is available. Player A is still available and ready to play with us.

Saturday Arise is ready to fly again. I ask the teammates, they say yes lets fly arise now. We say no to player A once and for all.

I ask him multiple times if he is 100% ready to come and he keeps saying yes. He says he is ready to give it his all and ready to move.

Due to it being the weekend I cant book the ticket as travel agent is closed.

Player A all this while is still not locked to any team and a free agent.

Sunday 8 pm IST player A's new team is announced and he is officially locked.

Sunday 9pm IST arise tells us he cant fly because he has 'family issues' and that he is demoralized.

20 mins later he messages me saying he is ready to fly again where I tell him I cannot risk his mood swings again waste any more time and officially remove him from the roster.

I have been very considerate in giving statements like unforeseeable circumstances and personal reasons because I dont like mud slinging but since we are being portrayed as the bad people who forced the young boy to fly to SEA I figured some clarity was necessary.

Tl, dr: Ar1se confirmed to move to SEA then changed decisions multiple times, making Entity Gaming to lose a tier 1 member to other team then denied to go to SEA. The manager is so pissed of the mood swing, he removed him from squad when Ar1se messaged again.~|article esports

A Brief History of Invoker|self.DotA2|~Thought I'd give a brief history of Invoker.
 
&nbsp;

I first played DotA in version 5.36, and have played it pretty much continuously from version 6.06. Ever since invoker was added, removed, and then re-added later he has been my favourite and main hero - I've probably accrued 3000+ games with him by now.
 
I wanted to give a history of Invoker as I have a few unique insights, things I didnt want lost to the mists of time.
 
&nbsp;

A little known fact is that although Invoker was released in version 6.10 when Icefrog was running the show, he was actually a product of the Guinsoo era and was already partially in the game files, with the final touches happening in the hazy interim period between Guinsoo, Neichus and IceFrog.
 
The basic idea and format for the Invoker was created by a map maker known as Bug. The hero's genesis comes largely in part from another custom map for Warcraft 3 called 'Spellcraft'. Players would collect various reagents as items, and combine them in different combinations to make spells they could then use. It was not uncommon for Guinsoo to 'borrow' hero ideas from other DotA like games - the game we play was after all originally called 'Dota All-stars', borrowing the best heroes from other games. But it would take the talents of IceFrog to actually bring the hero into the game.
 
&nbsp;

In version 6.10 Invoker was finally released in a playable form. Strangely, he started his life as a Radiant hero (called Sentinel back then) before being later shifted to Dire (called Scourge). The normal mode of the game back then limited you to only playing Sentinel or Scourge, so an effort was made to keep the two teams relatively balanced - although in practice most everyone played Allpick making it a moot point.

The main difference between the old Invoker and the new was that the order in which the reagents of Quas, Wex and Exort were invoked mattered - QQW would invoke a different spell to QWQ for example. This gave him a total of 27 different spells. Invoke as an ability only had one level and was gotten at level 6 (with only one spell slot on a 12s CD) and the effect of Quas and Exort were swapped - Quas gave a percentage damage boost, and Exort gave HP regen. There were other small differences as well, but these were the main ones.

[Here](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Invoker/Old) is a listing of the old abilities.

&nbsp;

Contrary to popular belief, Invoker wasnt some super imbalanced powerhouse in his old incarnation. In my opinion the modern Invoker is much more powerful and flexible. An example is the regen provided by the old Exort compared to the modern Quas - it used to max out at 7.2 hp/s, but now its max is 21 hp/s. There has been tremendous power creep since then, but fundamentally because he could only combo two spells every 12 seconds it really limited the total damage output he had. Likewise his old spells didnt have the synergy the modern ones do (such as the Tornado, Meteor, Blast combo).
 
Yet at the same time, certain spells were definitely overpowered or buggy on release. Chaos Meteor's damage was twice as powerful as it should have been, and Shroud of Flames (a spell similar to Ember Spirits Flame Guard) would damage towers. I think these early buggy and not-yet-balanced spells are what people have in mind when they recall Invoker being the epitome of imbalance. From my experience, heroes such as Spirit Breaker on release (in 6.08) were much more powerful.
 
In any case, while he did have some overly powerful spells, versions 6.11 to 6.16 saw a series of balance changes that brought him largely in line with the other heroes, and by then he was relatively well balanced. But despite these balance changes, because he could only have one spell invoked at a time with a 12s CD to switch them out players would often rely on one or two spells and only spam those - especially if those spells had a cooldown less than Invoke itself. This would remain a fundamental flaw in the hero design.
 
&nbsp;

What was Invoker like playing then? Fun and uniquely rewarding. I had a list of all 27 spells taped to the side of my monitor, and even to this day recall many of the more important ones such as Owl Scout being WEQ - long since burnt into muscle memory. And although he had access to 27 spells, many of them were outclassed by others, and so only 15 or so were important all of the time. Spells such as Firestorm or Chaos Meteor were always better than Inferno - when you can only cast one spell every 12s, you would cast the best. However I always admired Invokers that knew to bring up Soul Blast to heal themselves (nuke and heal in one), or Soul Reaver to chase (nuke and speed boost in one).
 
One other peculiarity of this era was that Invoker was soon shifted into his own separate tavern away from the other heroes (in the old maps there were six or so 'taverns' housing the heroes - the player would select the tavern, then spawn their hero from the tavern). This special tavern had to be activated with a command from the player who hosted the game. Incidentally techies was also in this tavern for a while, as was the old silencer after he was remade (the one with starfall and summon infernal). 

&nbsp;
 
When 6.17 was released, Invoker was removed from the game. While it was partially because of his 27 spell design, it was also largely due to core-functionality bugs brought on by the WC3 engine that Icefrog was still struggling with. One key bug was that spamming Wex would cause spell projectiles to miss (such as Naga Siren's Net). Likewise simply changing orbs would interrupt actions, something not remedied until years later. I think the inability to easily iron out the bugs was as much a factor in his removal as the need for a rework - this was seen earlier with heroes such as Bloodseeker being removed temporarily because of bugs brought on by engine limitations.
 
I and many others put forward ideas and suggestions for how the hero could be improved in the interim. The most common suggestion was to make it so the order of reagents invoked didnt matter, bringing his spell total from 27 down to a much more manageable 10. Some of his older spells would be recombined into the new ones, whilst others were simply dropped. Incidentally, quite a few of his spells would be re-purposed for other heroes such as Betrayal becoming Winter Wyverns ultimate and the aforementioned Flame Guard.
 
&nbsp;

In 6.49, Invoker returned as a 'secret boss'. Several of the 6.x9 versions had special summonable enemies that would take a team to battle against a bit like what is seen with Wraith Night, Year Beast etc. In this case Invoker was a powerful enemy that spammed spells and could be fought in the Roshan pit.

In 6.50, Invoker made his return as a playable hero. He has remained largely unchanged since then, except for the spells Alacrity and EMP being swapped around (WWW to WWE and vice versa). Alacrity only used to boost attack rate, and EMP removed mana based on Wex, and did damage based on Exort (a combination of the old EMP and Energy Ball spells). He was also given an Aghanim's Sceptre upgrade.

Invoker's model was based on Kael'thas Sunstrider, leader of the Blood Elves, from which he had the name Kael. He also had the fun name Kal-El, Superman's true name. When a leaked Chinese change log for patch 6.72 arrived on the internet, it was hurriedly put through Google translate to get a rough English version, which mistakenly translated  his name as "Carl". The humorous name caught on,but when IceFrog joked "Carl had it coming" in reference to the numerous nerfs Invoker received, this alternate name was all but cemented.
 
&nbsp;

What's in the future for Invoker? Who knows. I personally feel he could use a new Aghanims effect that actually boosts the power of his spells and not just reduces the cooldown of Invoke. A simple solution would be each reagent is considered one level higher. Quas level 7 would be considered level 8 and create an icewall that slows for 160% and lasts for 13.5s (instead of 140% and 12s).
 
Invoker is a unique and rewarding hero to master, and a signature of the great game of DotA itself.
 
Hope you enjoyed.

Every OG.Ana mid matchup during Kiev Majors|self.DotA2|~This is a repost since the post was removed, and then put back on but with no text...

Ana at the time of the kiev majors had the highest world mmr. Close to 9.4k mmr. Even then, there doesn't seem to be nearly as much hype on him if we compare him to rtz, miracle or midone. 

I've looked into some data. First I want to see the priority that OG gives for ana's hero in their drafts and compare the numbers with the other top 4 teams. All the data below was manually taken from [dotabuff](https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/leagues/5157).

[Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nAbdMAa1ooHTv-_gpPkOOU0UvET1kK0crtb-3ejEKnI/edit?usp=sharing)

**Pick Priority**


My first impression before looking at this data was that OG didn't really last picked ana's hero too often but looking at it we can see that while OG is not the team that gives the most priority to its mid player , they are very close in terms of 4th/5th picking ana a hero.

**Relationship between pick order and winrate**

This sample size is rather small and my non-statistics brain feels like the better way to decide whether there's any relationship between ana recieving the last pick and OG winning would be to analyze more games. That wouldn't be enough either since there are a lot of variables that are not being considered: different drafts, different teams, players could be playing something they are not familiar/don't like.

Even then: Ana has a huge winrate discrepancy when he gets his hero picked as the last one. He had **81% winrate** in this case, **33% when he got 4th pick** and **50% with 3rd pick**.

**How good are the matchups OG gives to ana ?**

To answer this question I decided to ask a 6.7 k player that is in the NA leaderbords(Dark Raider [twitter](https://twitter.com/DarkraiderDota) his opinnion on every draft that og played. Waga voluntereed to help but since it took some time for him to see my message I ended up forced to write this since I'm going to travel for 3 days. There will be a video version of this so I'll probably add his opinions there. The questions the  mid player needed to answer for every draft was: Define Ana's matchup in the midlane in terms of favourable, not favourable, even or arguable and do you think ana's hero fit's the draft ? (Not only has synergy with his team but is ok against the enemies draft.)

**Disclaimer** The guy was super nice, humble and helped me all the way in this part of the text. He just wanted everyone to know that he doesn't feel nearly as good as the OG players and when he answers whether he feels like x hero fits the lineup he is giving his input that he feels is definitely inferor to OG's but obviously relevant for most people reading this.

**SG SERIES**

---

[game 1](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3137046741) 
**Ana's Arc Warden vs Puck**

Favourable ? **No**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **No**

Result: **Loss
**

Player note: **Puck favored// phase shift great for dodging spark wraiths// illusory orb means puck never dies solo and has greater kill potential I would not last pick arc warden into a puck. As you can see sg last picked it as I assume they also believed it to be a strong matchup**

---

[game 2](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3137147095) 
**Ana's OD vs Ember**

Favourable ? **Yes**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**

Result: **Win**

Player note: **Def OD favored specifically vs ember but od pretty much solid matchup most of the time mid I would last pick this hero. Also great in that game vs morph and counter to lc duel**

---


[game 3](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3137225459) 
**Ana's DK vs Invoker**

Favourable ? **No**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**

Result: **Win**

Player note: **Should be invoker favored but living armour balances it out a bit more
The dk pick seems to be more overall draft focused than lane focused OG wanted to push and needs a front line tanky hero**

---

**IG SERIES**

---

[game 1](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3137643518) 
**Ana's Invoker vs TA**

Favourable ? **No**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **No**

Result: **Loss**

Player note: **Hugely ta favored one of the most favored matchups for mid currently
Invoker can't do much to refraction at early levels and most ta's by lvl six get a blight stone and low armor invokers get forced out of lane or die**

---

[game 2](https://t.co/7M3SxtSc68) 
**Ana's DK vs Storm**

Favourable ? **Even**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**

Result: **Loss**

Player note: **Even matchup hard to kill dk as storm alone but breathe fire and static remnant help both cs well
Range matchup vs melee mid always favors range a little more but only slightly**

---

**RANDOM SERIES**

---

[game 1](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3138972122) 
**Ana's TA vs Medusa**

Favourable ? **Yes**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**

Result: **Win**

Player note: **Looks like Medusa was mid but shadow played him and he is usually their carry player so that might just be a comfort draft for random.
That said ta has an advantage// Medusa can burn mana but not deal damage with refraction up mostly they trade farm
I'd pick ta against Medusa and in this game**

---

[game 2](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3139052266) 
**Ana's SF vs Lina**

Favourable ? **NO**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **?**

Result: **Loss**

Player note: **Its always about souls for sf with a mk helping lina it should be Lina favored for a long time
Lina has a lot of kill potential on sf once sf gets levels though he can double raze waves and go jungle
So while Lina favored sf shouldn't be too threatened and can catchup fast**

---

**Ana's Invoker vs Troll**

Favourable ? **Yes**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**

**THUNDERBIRD SERIES**

---

[game 1](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3139522868) 
**Ana's DK vs Lina**

Favourable ? **NO**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**

Result: **LOSS**

Player note: **Really good matchup for lina
And with a BH on her team should be a dominant mid lane
This def looks like a dk pick to help with their lineup this is the 2nd time they picked it with arc warden I believe so might be a draft they like
He has a mk on his side but BH cancels it out
I personally wouldn't pick dk into lina but seems like OG had a draft in mind
I don't want to seem like I know better than OG or anything like that lol just my opinions**

---

[game 2](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3139652866) 
**Ana's ember vs Lina**

Favourable ? **NO**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**

Result: **Win**

Player note: **Lina favored can take off flameguard pretty easily but they have tree armor again to help ember
Main focus is on alch for OG tho so I can see ember being good for their lineup
I'd pick it for a good lineup but not to win the lane vs lina when ember is 6 he can kill lina tho**

---


[game 3](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3139768515) 
**Ana's Alch vs Meepo**

Favourable ? **Even**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**

Result: **Win**

Player note: **Its an alch not really much for laning with that hero
Meepo can kill alch if he lanes but I think they both jungle to get extra farm after pushing out a wave mid

**Ana's ember vs DP**

Favourable ? **NO**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**

Result: **LOSS**

Player note: **Strong dp lane //has a silence later on but siphon soul hard to get rid of flameguard tho
Looks like a decent ember lineup for OG idk much about arc warden OG seemed to like it but they seemed to lose with it a decent amount
I'd pick ember for the game not so much for mid matchup but its not bad**

---


[game 3](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3144797892) 
**Ana's Ember vs Lina**

Favourable ? **NO**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**

I'd pick od vs that lineup good for slark Abba and morph**

---

[game 2](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3146595270) 
**Ana's TA vs OD**

Favourable ? **YES**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**

**Ana's Terrorblade vs Alchemist**

Favourable ? **Yes**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**

Result: **Win**

Player note: **Tb ran mid //interesting //good pressure not killing alch but force him out of lane take his towers and go pressure other lane

**Ana's Ember vs QOP**

Favourable ? **Even**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**

Result: **WIN**

Player note: **Lane matchup pretty even qop ranged but later on with levels ember can kill qop and he has tree armor eg had mk tho

**Ana's TA vs Ursa**

Favourable ? **Arguable**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**

Result: **LOSS**

Player note: **Again Ursa mid which really fits VP style so I see why they pick it but ta can survive with refraction and mk helping again
I'd pick ta vs ursa
But looks like VP had a better overall draft this game**

---


[game 3](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3149353238) 
**Ana's Storm vs DK**

Favourable ? **Even**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **NO**

---


[game 4](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3149480550) 
**Ana's Ember vs Silencer**

Favourable ? **NO**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Yes**

Result: **WIN**

Player note: **Silencer good laner vs ember usually comes out ahead//

---

[game 5](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3148721353) 
**Ana's Troll vs OD**

Favourable ? **NO**

Does the hero fits the lineup ? **Arguable**

Result: **WIN**

Player note: **Really good matchup for OD as we saw OG went down early but outplayed VP got back into the game and troll carried them
So no I wouldn't pick troll into od but that's why I'm me and OG are major winners they know what it takes to win**

---

I know there are issues with me analyzing this data, I'll list some of them here:

* The data is opinion based and can vary

* There is not enough data (but as you can see manualy gathering and analyzing this is not easy at all)

* I'm not comparing how other teams match up their mid players

That being said though I feel like the compiled list on its own is pretty cool and I want to at least sort the results I get and see what can come out of it. 

If you go back to the table i gave right in the begining you're going to note some very important things. 

* **41% of times, OG gave Ana a matchup that is not optimal**
* **While 29% of times the matchup was considered good or very good. The other 29% of games are even matchups or games where roamers or other heroes could mess with how the lane would go.**

On top of that one stat I want to highlight is that Ana only lost one game where the matchup was considered good for him while he won a lot of games that he was given a bad lane. Of course, since OG won they are going to have a high wr regardless but if you look at the table from the 24 games, 9 were considered bad matchups and he won 5 of those games. Meaning his winrate against bad matchups is not too far away from OG's overall winrate in the tournament. 

* **Winrate against bad matchups: 55%**
* **Winrate against good matchups: 85%**
* **OG's tournament winrate: 62%**

A lot of the Analysts in the desk were saying that Ana is one type of player that can comeback into the game way better than other mid players like midone/noOne/Miracle. I'm not sure this data really supports that even though it definitely felt like that watching the major. 

I'll also analyze how much resources OG spends trying to help mid when you compare it to EG/VP/IG . I feel like this is one very important stat that i just couldn't obtain without watching the games so i feel like a video version is better for that. I don't want to draw any bold statements here, so my humble conclusions are:

* Contrary to popular belief OG does give Ana priority in the draft. When you compare the number of 4th and 5th mid picks for OG they are only behind VP (but not so far away from other teams)

* It does feel like OG is more focused in the overal game plan than their lanes (not necessarily only mid). The fact that Ana has had more bad matchups than good ones can testify to that and considering OG won the major it feels like  OG are very good at playing around a mid player that won't have so much impact in the mid game. 

* I wanted to add an analysys on whether OG last pick Ana's heroes focusing on mid matchup or game plan. Unfortunately this took longer to write than i expected and i don't have the pick data in the google spreadsheet. Sorry about that but i'll try to include it in the video
Regardless of Ana being good at playing from behind you can't really deny that when he gets a good lane matchup he is a decisive force in OG winning. (55% wr with bad matchup and 85% when he has a good one)

Blog (or novella): My time as a DotA 2 sponsor - FYM Hot Sauce|fymhotsauce.rocks||article esports
An analysis of Luna's win rate: does the visible portion of the moon in the night sky affect hero success?|self.DotA2|~Heroes based on certain themes are commonplace in DotA2; one need not look far to recognize the in-your-face connection between "Lycan" and a man who transforms into a wolf. Similarly, there is Luna, a woman whose name literally translates to "moon" and whose responses and abilities are dominated by references to that celestial body. While some heroes' themes are limited to fantasy, the moon is a staple in our own lives.  Indeed, the moon has real world implications, from tides, to animal behavior, and even acting as the basis for calendar months.  Some even go so far as to suggest the moon's influences on the menses.  

That being said, the relationship between the moon and its influence on the innate, subconscious abilities of video game players remains poorly defined.  Therefore, in this seminal, preliminary study, I sought to determine if players seemingly respond to the phase of the moon in an instinctual manner, as measured by improved win-rate outcomes for a largely moon based hero.  To this end, I compared the visible portion of the moon in the night sky to the average win rate of Luna to determine if there was any correlation between the two. **I hypothesize as the visible portion of the moon increases, Luna's win rate will exhibit a slight rise, which will fall again as the phase shifts to "new moon"**.

To orient readers with the basis of this study, I have compiled relevant information into [Figure 1, as seen here](http://imgur.com/a/gP0Gc).  Figure 1C displays the names and pictorial representation of the phases of the moon in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Note, while the orientation of the moon may differ between the two hemispheres, the visible percentage of the moon remains the same.  The phases of the moon in the past two weeks of May 2017 are highlighted in Figure 1A, and Figure 1B shows Luna's win rate over this same period in time. From Figures 1A and 1B it is plainly evident that Luna's win rate went under a substantial increase from May 3 (first or half moon) to May 10 (full moon).  Granted, there are minor fluctuations during this period, but the overall increase is the important takeaway.

Some of you may be saying, "so what?"  Rightly so, this was just one example.  This is why in Figure 2 I plotted the visible portion of the moon against Luna's win rate over a one year period.  [As seen here](http://imgur.com/a/aUwWL), the visible portion of the moon (in blue) follows a sinusoidal function, varying from 0 to 100%.  Luna's win rate is plotted in red, and can be seen fluctuating generally between 50-55%. When zooming in on the chart, the pattern between Luna's win rate and the moon's phases becomes clear.  **Generally, as the moon reaches peak visibility, Luna's win rate peaks.  Indeed, as the moon waxes, Luna's mercy appears to wane.  Conversely, as the moon loses visibility, Luna's win rate will fall.**  This pattern is not exhibited in 100% of the peaks and valleys of the moon's visibility, as there are expected fluctuations based on balance changes to the hero and random chance, but in general, the above described correlation seems to happen more often than due to random probability alone.  

To further demonstrate this correlation between Luna's win rate and the visible portion of the moon, I compared the average percent change in win rate during the transitions between each of the moon's phases over the same year.  [As seen in Figure 3](http://imgur.com/a/AS9Np), there is a striking positive change in Luna's win percentage as the moon wanes, and a corresponding negative change as the moon waxes.  **Taken together, these data strongly suggest the visible portion of the moon affects Luna's win rate.**

I therefore propose a new chart-based system to determine when players should or should not prioritize playing Luna based on the phases of the moon, which includes my newly minted "Phases of Luna" as seen below:





Moon Phase|  Should I play Luna?| Phases of Luna
----|----|----
New|  No| Newbs Only
Waxing Crescent|  If you're feeling lucky| Waxing Luna
First Quarter|  Flip a coin| Coin Flip
Waxing Gibbous|  Probably okay| Increasingly Waxing Luna
Full|  Yes| Full Win Potential
Waning Gibbous|  Worth a shot| Waning Luna
Last Quarter|  Flip a coin| Coin Flip Two
Waning Crescent|  Can't reccommend| Increasingly Waning Luna

Granted, there are limitations to this study, such as the cloud cover and its effect on the overall visibility of the moon regardless of the phase. Also, the data presented here do not shed insight into what mechanism explains the observed correlation.  It remains unclear whether the moon itself is having an effect, or simply the players' awareness of the moon. Further studies should also address whether or not Tidehunter might also be affected in a similar manner.  Thank you for reading, and I look forward to your comments.

Happy 322. Today we take a moment to recognize the match-fixing issue in eSports.|self.DotA2|~322\. It's hard to find a more infamous number in Dota. You would be dreaming to think of a danker Dota meme.  While we sit in a circle high atop our tower of upvotes, furiously jerking over these three very important numbers, it's hard to take a step back and realize just how serious they actually are.   

For those who are uninitiated, 322 is more than just a joke. Maybe you don't play Dota and have only ever known 322 as a highway, or  23x14. Maybe you have seen it typed in your pub games when Io builds a shadow blade. Maybe you've seen it in passing in discussions. Regardless, 322 might be big in the well informed Dota communities, but it's impact in the wider eSports scene feels small. Today, on March 22^nd we aim to change that. 

So what is 322? 322 is slang for a Dota match-fixing. Match-fixing is the process of playing a match in an organized sport in which the outcome is pre-determined. In June of 2013 during Star Ladder Season 6, just that happened. RoX.KIS Dota 2 squad was playing a group stage match vs zRAGE. The match was insignificant in regards to standings as both teams were out of the tournament at this point. Solo, RoX's captain, placed a $100 bet against his team in this match.  A match that they were heavily favored to win. 

It was a shock when zRAGE won the match; as many people betting in game items, factious funny money, and real currency, lost the safe bet.  Upset happen in sports, often times that's the fun of betting in the first place. However when Solo was found to have placed a bet against his own team, everything changed. Controversy ran rapid through the Dota scene. Reputations were tarnished, player integrity ruined, and skeptics born. Solo received a lifetime ban from Star Ladder. His team and organization were also punished to a lesser extent. All of this fuss, and what did Solo get out of it? **$322.** A meme is born. 

Match-fixing isn't a new conundrum in the world of eSports. You're most likely familiar with this term because of it's traditional sports shenanigans. Could you imagine Kobe rolling on into the sports book and dropping a stack against the Lakers? No? That's right because player's simply cant bet against your own team in professional sports. It's against the rules, and in many cases just strait illegal. Maybe you've heard about the 1919 world series? Or Tim Donaghy? Or the Italian Football Scandal? 

In addition to existing offline, match-fixing has plagued a myriad of other prestigious eSports titles. Broodwar was rocked in 2010 when the Korean news confirmed Match Fixing going on in Starcraft. KeSPA banned 11 professional players, who received massive fines once they were confirmed to have bet against themselves. In addition gaming was these players documented professions in Korea, these illegal acts were punishable by law. since The loyal Broodwar community felt quite betrayed.

Counter Strike community has run rampant with allegations and confirmed match fixing reports already in 2015. Back in January iBUYPOWER caused quite the mess when they were found to have thrown a match against NetCodeGuides. Mind you that at this point in time the iBuy team was playing and representing as a premiere American team. After heavy bets were placed by a group of people with insider information, the clowny match and subsequent loss was just the tip of the iceberg. Ultimately Valve, the game's developer, levied lifetime suspensions on those involved. Not a month later in February Valve had to dish out additional bans, in the process setting a firm precedent on what happens when you bet on games when you're a pro. 

League of Legends has not stopped itself from cutting a nice ol' hunk of drama pie for itself either. Last year Ahq e-Sports Club was confirmed to be fixing matches. Their team manager was tricking one of their players into throwing games, which was fueling his eSports gambling addiction in attempt to make back the team's salary money which he lost prior. This story is more notable as the player who was aiding in fixing the matches was so distraught, he attempted to hill himself by leaping off a twelve story building. 

Again we find outselves back in Dota 2 where the match fixing did not stop with Solo.  Arrow Gaming, namely it's players DDZ and Lance, were ousted after rumors were posted to reddit that they were involved with betting and match fixing incidents which were plaguing the SEA region. After much work and many lies were spit to attempt to cover tracks, the two players admitted to match fixing. 

But what ever happened to Solo? His ban was lifted after a year. He continues to play on professional Dota 2 teams to this day. 

322 is more than a meme. It embodies an entire controversy. Match-fixing is real. Gambling problems are serious. There are professional players in every major eSport that have dabbled in, or considered the abominable behavior. Fixing matches has the ability to undermine so much in an industry we are working so hard to grow. It's becoming more than just a game, and criminals need to be treated to the highest of standards. We can not be tolerant of short term player bans, or new teams containing known offenders.  Valve with their firm hand in a step in the right direction regarding Counter Strike in 2015.

Happy 322 to you. Let us look forward to the amazing year of competition ahead, and the continued growth of a joy we all share. ~|article esports

How Far We've Come - An analysis of the meta over the years.|self.DotA2|~As the smoke settles on Key Arenas stage (quite literally, thanks to the pyrotechnics), we the spectators are left to pick apart the complex meta that to the tune of which $11 million has been won. One of the greatest things about Dota 2 is the multitude of strategies that can all lead to success; in the words of ~~~~n0tail~~~~ BigDaddy, everything can work. These meta shifts can be seen clearly when examining past Internationals, with each tournament possessing its own style of play. 

&nbsp;

###The International 2011 - TI1

In the first International, all eyes were fixated on the teams carries. Antimage and Spectre battled to be the most sought after hero, with Weaver and Sven being picked up in the event that the former heroes were already banned. In this meta, killing the enemys carry was massive, and having your own carry be killed  devastating. Many matches would be determined simply by the amount of gold in your carrys pocket, and as such, space-creating supports were in high demand. Vengeful Spirit and Earthshaker meant that any potential threat to your carry could be neutralized with a well-aimed stun, and an offlane Beastmaster provided mobile vision in an effort to prevent ganks. Chen also sat on the top of teams shopping lists, a trend we would continue to see for the next two Internationals thanks to his versatility. In a meta as carry-centric as this, I personally find it a shame that BurNing would not be seen on the big stage until the following year, and with the next International comes the next metagame.

&nbsp;

###The International 2012 - TI2

It is in this International that we saw arguably the most radical meta shift. Gone was the strong focus on protecting the carry, and its place lain a strong emphasis on pushing. After all, in what other meta could Leshrac and Venomancer be considered top picks? Even Broodmother got to stretch her legs on the battlefield on a fairly consistent basis. Teams looked for early pick offs, and then attempted to push the lane of the fallen foe and take a tower. In the mid game, it was not uncommon for a team to fight with only four players while the fifth continued to push.  As far as carries went, Morphling made waves in the scene due to his ability to push and resistance to being ganked, as did Lone Druid. As one might imagine, Lycan and the recently added Naga Siren thrived in this metagame  or at least they would have had they not been banned nearly every game. Dark Seer and Natures Prophet occupied the offlanes of most matches due to their ability to counter-push, and Invoker and Queen of Pain were often found in the middle lane for the same reason. A special mention goes to Rubick, who played nearly every position apart from carry (fingers crossed for TI5).

&nbsp;

###The International 2013 - TI3

Whenever TI3 is mentioned, the first strategy that usually comes to mind is Rat Dota. Although this was the tactic which led team Alliance to victory, it is important to note that this was not the predominant strategy throughout the tournament. Instead, this metagame saw the rise to powerful trilanes in an effort to secure the carry some early farm as well as shut down the often elusive enemy offlaner.  Teams attempted to gain an early advantage and then press this advantage in midgame teamfights. Visage was as popular as a Doom in TI4 (more on that later) due to his strong lane presence, especially when paired with a jungling Chen or support Naga Siren. In addition, teams chose carries that could fight far earlier in the match, such as Weaver, Alchemist, and Lifestealer. By doing this, teams ensured that they would be ready to teamfight once they were confident of their advantage, instead of being hindered by an under-farmed carry. Although Dark Seer and Natures Prophet still dominated the scene as the most common offlaners, teams also added Timbersaw and Batrider to their playbooks (although the latter spent the majority of the tournament in the ban pool). Countless matches featured Puck and Dragon Knight battling it out in the middle lane, with the first blood often going the way of the team whose supports ganked mid first. It is due to the meta of this tournament that Dota received the Great Offlane Patch of 79. Among other things, this patch lessened the need for safe offlaners and strong trilaners, the effect of which we would see in the coming tournaments.

&nbsp;

###The International 2014 - TI4

 And so here we are; in a meta where hard carries are optional and a match can be considered long by making it to the 40 minute mark. Rather than farming, most teams opted to go on the early offensive in an effort to snowball out of control, and their drafts reflected this. Rather than picking the more traditional carries that were seen in previous Internationals, Razor and Doom populated nearly every game due to their ability to anti-carry. After all, who needs a carry when you can instead shut down the enemys carry? Back in TI3, the crowd went wild upon seeing NaVi last pick Skywrath Mage, a hero who was relatively unseen in pro games. One short year later, he has become a first pick due to his early nuke potential and devastating silence. Shadow Shaman underwent a similar spike in popularity thanks to his ultimate which allowed teams to claim easy towers upon reaching level six. The aforementioned patch following TI3 opened teams up to a vast selection of offlane heroes which were formerly considered too risky. Tidehunter, Doom and Brewmaster thrived in the short lane, making use of their inherent tankiness to fend off harassment, and in some matchups, even threaten the lives of the enemy carries. In many ways, the offlaner could be considered the most influential position since one great Ravage or Primal Split could be just the thing a team needed to begin their snowball to victory. Although the grand finals may not have been the climatic ending that many had hoped for, it was a fitting representation of the metagame that was in play.

&nbsp;

In four years, we have come from a game about protecting the carry, to a game where the first teamfight can mean everything. We have come from a game where the offlaner is lucky if he gets a last hit, to a game where he might have the highest net worth on the team. We have come from a game where no one picks Zeus, to a game where still no one picks Zeus  but it is only a matter of time until the meta swings in his favor. After all, *everything can work*.~|article esports

Sorry about the problems in those games (camera and UI), don't blame it on the casters, blame it on me, and I am gonna blame it on Valve...


---------------------------------------------------------


In my opinion it was a good tournament, group stage was not so great, only 1 group was tough, the rest had 2 much better teams than the rest. The biggest bot problem is not pushing enough, and randoming heroes, as you can see, 2 out of top 3 bots play only 6 heroes max. Those bots have a good or at least decent team composition, and can win games constantly, bots that use many heroes depend on the heroes picked in the certain game A LOT. As far as I understand bot makers only have tools to setup drafting AI in captains draft mode, however very few bots actually had drafting AI at all, so I had to make the entire tournament all pick. I am really hoping that next time more bots (or all) will have captains mode drafting AI, so we can make a normal tournament.


There are many things bots cannot yet do, and that id due to the valve's API, which I hope will be fixed very soon, so we can see some even better bots, I don't think these bots are bad either, every bot in top 7 is better than stock bots! Even some outside of the top 7 are. I would say great job to all the bot makers, with tools they have, and little time they have they outplay Valve's AI, NICE JOB!


I don't want this to be too long, so I will finish it here with plans for the future. I intend to continue doing this until valve or some bigger Dota 2 tournament organizer takes over. Next tournament will have 16 teams, that will allow me to make the competition less luck based, by playing more than BO1 in the group stage, and having double elimination. TOP 8 teams automatically qualified for the next tournament, while 9-12 seeds will fight each other in double elimination for 2 spots, bottom 2 teams from there will join rest of the bots in normal qualification rounds, for which I still haven't decided the format. New seeding can be seen [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CEk6QEr2Cz59yn2QSQNisD9od9ysHQs9Po0ohAeXFJY/edit?usp=sharing)


I hope valve will decide to make this easier for me too, by allowing spectators with DotaTV (directed camera) in the local servers, or only bot games on their servers, or at least being able to play the replay from a local server a bit 
later other than just after the game, and never again (sometimes not even after the game).


----------------------------------------------------


THANK YOU EVERYONE, SEE YOU COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL!!!!


I will try to answer every tournament or bot related question this time, so if you have any, shoot!

The first reported case of a DotA2-related medical condition: A PASTA MAC Syndrome.|self.DotA2|~**Introduction**

To date, the application of medical knowledge has been widely overlooked and ignored for DotA2s heroes.  There is currently no recorded description of any disease states or phenotypic abnormalities in this unique population.  Here, I present the first report of a medical syndrome affecting a small number of DotA2 heroes.  Three individuals, patients A, B, and C, were selected for study based on their shared presentation of symptoms and defects.  

**Background of patients**

All three male patients are from a similar background, which initially made it difficult to determine whether or not their symptoms were a result of environmental effects, or due to a syndrome acquired at birth.  These individuals all have a tribal upbringing, and to my knowledge, maintain status in their respective tribes.  Of note, all three have what they might describe as magical powers, due to their shared and overlapping occupations of witch doctor, shaman, and healer.

**Posture and gait**

As seen in [Figure 1](http://imgur.com/a/KgfSw), all three patients share a similar posture.  Kyphosis, or a round/hunched back is evident and most prominently displayed in patient A.  Patient B also exhibits this abnormal stance and back curvature, while patient C has a more mild case.  The variability in severity of kyphosis may be explained by patients ages, as patient A is significantly older than patient C.  Walking, as it relates to posture, was also examined in each patient.  From the observed clips below, each patient takes short, quick steps which might be described as a shuffling gait.  Patient A again appears most severely affected, appearing unsure on his feet.

[Patient A](https://gfycat.com/DisfiguredNiftyCopperhead) 

[Patient B](https://gfycat.com/WhimsicalInsistentDunnart) 

[Patient C](https://gfycat.com/DiscreteMealyAsianelephant) 

**Speech**

Upon vocal examination, it was found that each patient had evidence of dysarthria, or slurred speech which often sounds like nonsensical, guttural ramblings.  In some instances, the impaired speech rendered the affecteds words incomprehensible.  Interestingly, all three patients have developed their own, unique imagined language, possibly as a compensatory effect to their impaired speech. Multiple examples of these defects are found below: 

**Patient A:** 
[Made up language](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/8/80/Wdoc_attack_06.mp3)**/**[Incomprehensible](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/5/54/Wdoc_level_06.mp3)**/**[Slurred speech](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/7f/Wdoc_laugh_03.mp3 )

**Patient B:** 
[Made up language](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/2/2f/Shad_ability_shackle_08.mp3)**/**[Incomprehensible](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/4/40/Shad_ability_voodoo_05.mp3)**/**[Guttural nonsense](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/5/56/Shad_ability_shackle_07.mp3)

**Patient C:** 
[Incomprehensible](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/2/29/Dazz_ability_sfx_07.mp3)**/**[Incomprehensible](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/8/83/Dazz_ability_sfx_03.mp3)**/**[Guttural noise](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/7c/Dazz_ability_sfx_04.mp3)

**Congenital defects**

Given the symptoms presented thus far, it remains unclear whether they can be explained by environmental causes or are potentially genetically acquired traits.  Interestingly, each patient presented with two obvious congenital defects.  The first of which is macrostomia, or an unusually wide mouth.  As seen in [Figure 2](http://imgur.com/a/6zPZY), each patient exhibits a mouth width that is substantially larger than average.  While the genetic cause is unknown, the development of this rare craniofacial defect results from failure of fusion of the maxillary and mandibular processes.  Additionally, the patients also lack digits, a condition known as adactyly. Referring again to [Figure 1](http://imgur.com/a/KgfSw), it is clear that each patient lacks at least one finger.  Patients A and B also appear to have an improper number of toes, which may contribute to their altered ambulation.  This defect can be due to a number of genetic causes, often in genes associated with development such as NOTCH1.  


 
**Conclusion**

This report represents the first known description of a medical syndrome in a group of DotA2 heroes.  The patients described here present a mix of what could be construed as environmentally brought-on symptoms (posture, gait, speech), as well as clearly congenital abnormalities (missing digits and wide mouth).  Additional family or tribal members were unavailable for study.  Given the nature of a shared background (tribe), and their congenital defects, I suggest patients A, B, and C present symptoms which are a result of a syndrome caused by genetic bottleneck.  Based on who is affected and the defects themselves, I propose to name this condition A PASTA MAC Syndrome (Abnormalities: Posture Ambulation Speech Tribally Associated with Macrostomia Adactyly; Congenital).  Whether this is an inherited or de novo condition is unclear, but these patients and their relatives should continue to be monitored for the worsening or development of symptoms.  Furthermore, I hope this report inspires future study into more yet to be described medical conditions amongst DotA2 heroes.

Also a few small instances of Centaur getting either Manta Styles, being involved with Shadow Demon as well or picking up illusion runes and destroying towers due to return could also have triggered this change)**

How we made cheat detector. gosu.ai against cheaters|self.DotA2|~Hey, Reddit!

Today we will talk about how we made [cheat detector](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/8816oh/12_of_all_matches_are_played_with_cheats_check/).

**Tl;dr**: To detect cheating we extracted mouse movements and all the actions player perform on a map from replays. We define cheaters and ready to share the API with third-party developers. Right now, our anti-cheat isn't perfect, the system doesn't track all existing cheats, but we will work hard in this direction.

[Try it out](https://dotacheat.gosu.ai/en/) and check if youve played with cheaters.

At the time of writing this article we analysed approximately 200k matches that were played by about 1 million unique players. Here we share with you some stats and tell how this system works. Further we will tell you how the anti-cheat works and share some stats.

Cheats for Dota 2, are you serious?

There are a lot of them, see [this review](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7yeeh5/cheats_are_real_eng_subs/). For the beginning we have implemented algorithm that detects cheats that could be identified by tracking mouse movements and clicks in replay.

**Camera hack**

Having enabled this cheat, unprincipled player is able to look at the distant places on a map with less mouse clicks and movement and faster respond to events taking place outside the screen. Note that the wide monitor does not make you a cheater, because the allowed extension of the view only works in width.
This is the most popular cheat, we found its use in **12.24%** (sic!) of all matches. Approximately **1.1%** of all players abuse this hack and 76% of them play with unacceptable zoom in each game.

[The player clicks outside the standard camera view, an additional click appears. Match ID: 3754671634
](https://gosuaiblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/6ucbhf4tqd-1.gif?w=1100)

We found zoomout (camera distance) in 12.24% of all matches. Unique users with cheats  1.02%, 76% of them used zoomout in each game.

**utomatic creep blocking**

Creep blocking is an important technique that allows mid-lane player to farm effectively at the start of the game. But what if the program will instantly click for you in a right place to stop creeps without any of your attention? Obviously, this kind of automatization is unfair.

Good news, there are only **0.1%** of players (one of 1000) who use this cheat in public matches, but you can meet cheater in **0.5%** of matches (one of 200).

[Look at fast clicks to distant points. Match ID: 3754671634]
](https://gosuaiblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/uqrypuooy9.gif?w=1100)


**Automatic items dropping**

Quick drop and pickup of some items under certain conditions could give your hero additional bonus. For instance, dropping and picking back Arcane Boots having Soul Ring gives the hero 75 freebie mana points, but actually to do so you have to spend a time to move mouse to the inventory bar and return it to the map.

At least **0.035%** (350 of one million) players make those actions automatically, without real mouse movement. This adds injustice to **0.328%** of matches.

[The player automatically throws items from the bag to get an additional bonus from pressing certain items. Match ID: 3730565232]
](https://gosuaiblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/6ecgfxfztr.gif?w=1100)

**How anti-cheat works**

To detect cheating we extracted mouse movements and all the actions player perform on a map from replays. To analyse player behavior we aggregate several statistics like the distance between the mouse position on a screen and the place where the players real action was registered. Then we use machine learning technique called [anomaly detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection): the algorithm learns from a sample of pure matches (manually checked by our Dota 2 experts for the absence of cheating) and then able to detect suspicious deviations from the norm.

To classify cheating behavior and estimate the accuracy of our detection we asked our experts to review random suspicious matches manually and make a strong decision  whether there was cheating or not? Statisticians call this technique an [acceptance sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_sampling). According to our current estimates, the detector has less than 3% of false positives (situations when the system erroneously blames player for cheating).

An ideal algorithm is hard to build because of the large number of unique situations. We offer our deepest apologies if your play will fall into those erroneous 3%. If it will, let us know by sending a feedback through This is wrong button. As mentioned before, our algorithm learns on the labeled replays. So, the more feedback you will send  the more accurate our anti-cheat will be.

**Lets collaborate**

We see a big problem with cheating behavior in public games, but we are not going to wait until #valvefixit. So heres our offer to the Dota 2 community, tournament platforms and other third-party developers: we are ready to give an access to our closed **API** for cheat-checking. If you are interested, please contact Kirill Chuvakov <k@gosu.ai>.

Were going to **make Dota 2 great again!**

Dota 2 Prizemoney Delays - What is actually happening|self.DotA2|~There is a bit of a culture of non-discussion when it comes to industry people putting blame on Valve because there is always this fear that you or your organization can get black balled. Its the reason you see so much vaguery around the prize pool issues today. I'll try to break it down as best as i can from our side and what knowledge i have and others can add the details they know 100% in this thread.


We've been in contact with Valve for a while about ~~$67k in community funding for Frankfurt. As you can imagine, when it comes to finance and sending out/taxing prize money it is much simpler to do this in one payment per team or player rather than breaking this into community/tournament contribution. This seems to be the feeling amongst all other leagues too....Frankfurt prize pool from our end has been paid out, except for a couple teams who asked to be able to invoice it rather than have direct transfer.

Some time during the summer, Valve changed some tax form rules and had some internal delays that i dont have info on for payment to tournaments. Basically every single major tournament got hit with the delay. 
- Dreamleague, ESL One, Starladder, probably BTS (LD? Godz?), etc etc.


MLG survived it because their event was before the rule change. No - leagues did not just decide to all as a group not pay out, as delicious as that sounds. Cyborgmatt can probably provide better explaination on what the issues were - to be honest i don't really think its that big of a deal because we all knew it was an issue Valve was working on. For whatever reason, the players did not....


Teams and their management have been aware of these issues for a while - consider that both EG and Navi run their own tournaments which were likely affected by the tax issues. For some reason the EG players and Envy either just have no clue about these types of discussions or got salty and decided to forget. To put it in context, this issue was ''big'' about 6 weeks ago when we all realized what happened but then teams/leagues started to talk and realized we were cool and just had to wait it out.

In general, it's a big deal, but its not a new deal and since everyone in the industry is shouting at themselves in private skype channels, a public thread so explain this is probably a bit better :) . It's mostly just growing pains of the system and Valve having to adjust it so it works legally for everyone - not a trivial task.
 

TL;DR All the leagues are still/were waiting for their community contribution money so payments all got delayed.


Edit: I didn't make this clear initially and checked with our team this morning. Everything from our side of prizepool was paid out weeks ago except for a couple teams who asked to be able to be able to invoice rather have it wired directly. We're just waiting for community money. I dont know the status of other leagues~|article esports

The Future of In-house Leagues|self.DotA2|~**The Future of In-house Leagues**

In-house leagues (IHL) have been a driving force in Dota for almost a decade. IHLs have cultivated competitive Dota scenes all over the world, and are responsible for connecting many of todays professional players. While the concept of an in-house league is ultimately simple, its impact cannot be understated. Despite their lasting influence, the future of IHLs are in jeopardy. With the largest esports tournament in history on the horizon, now is the perfect time to ensure the everlasting success of the IHL.

The majority of todays professional players were first recognized from their involvement in an IHL. Here are just a few examples:

	Arteezy joined Kaipi after meeting EternaLEnVy in C9-DL, and became an icon through his play in NEL.

	ppd made a name for himself in HoN, but met his current teammate Arteezy in NEL.

	mason began ringing for EG due to his success in NEL.

	Universe and ixmike88 entered the competitive scene through NADL and other North American IHLs.

	1437 and Universe joined OK.Nirvana.int after playing together in DCIHL.

	DeMoN made a name for himself in DXD before joining hi2u.

	MSS was originally asked to ring for Team Liquid because he was on top of the NEL ladder.

	eHug was formed with five NEL players.

	Jubei met eHug through IXDL which led to his MLG attendance and relocation to Korea.

	Shadows of the Past formed after playing together in NEL.

	Many pro Chinese players, including ZSMJ, YYF, ChuaN, Yao, Mu, LaNm, Super, cty, and papaxiong have competed in CDEC, the premier in-house league in China.

	EternaLEnVy met kizzles in IXDL to form the first No Tidehunter roster.

	H4nn1, Loda, Akke, Pajkatt, MiSeRy, Puppey, Dendi, and XBOCT have all played in in-house leagues from IHCS to EEL.

**The Importance of In-house Leagues**

The future of Dota 2 as an esport relies on fostering new talent and efficiently ushering them into the competitive scene. This is sometimes accomplished by recognizing the talent of an unknown pub star, but more often than not, a player turns pro after engaging in semipro competitions. Amateur and semipro team leagues have always been an important part of esports infrastructure. But semipro competition has a lot of barriers to overcome  most notably, team stability. Most players cannot commit the necessary time to improve without compensation. Unfortunately, esports has not yet grown to a point where semipro players can make a living wage. Its no wonder that semipro teams become discouraged and quickly disband before reaching the professional level. In the rare occasion that a player has the dedication and lifestyle to pursue a professional Dota 2 career, the other four teammates are most likely not in the same situation. The team disbands, and the player has to start over.

This is why IHLs are a vital complement to semipro leagues. IHLs allow a player to improve without being attached to four big question marks. Dedicated IHL players are easily recognized by their activity and desire to improve. The best players rise to the top, and are either approached by pro players who also compete in the IHL, or form a team with other individuals who have shown similar talent.

Of course we cannot ignore perhaps the most scrutinized aspect of IHLs, the community. Nowhere else do players learn and grow as quickly as an IHL, largely because of the constant interaction with other competitive players. Strategy discussions and technical tips are often the focus of an IHLs chat. Sometimes these discussions get a bit heated. Sometimes theyre serious, and sometimes theyre all in good fun. Ultimately if youre feeding, something is wrong, and learning to take criticism is an important step to improvement. This atmosphere has historically crafted the metagame for professional competitions. Mass games with competitive players spawn trends quicker than a limited number of pro matches where teams have a lot riding on every game. 

**A Brief History of In-house Leagues**

The first IHL was created by Ucross in 2005. High skilled players were invited to compete in a league in which every game had a new set of teammates, and each player competed to raise their individual ranking. With only a couple hundred players, disciplinary issues were handled quickly, and inadequate players were removed from the league. New talent was invited by established players and was subject to a strict probationary period.
The original IHL began with mostly North American players, but interest quickly spread and the European IHCS was born. Since then, hundreds of IHLs have existed throughout the world, connecting the best Dota players in both exclusive and open communities.
IHLs reached new heights in Dota 2 with the introduction of the NADotA Elite League (NEL), followed by sister leagues in Europe, South America, and Korea. Through todays DotaTV ticket system, TwitchTV streaming, sponsored prize pools, and custom league software, these elite leagues brought more fame and fortune to IHL players than ever before.

**The Threat**

The Elite Leagues were thriving until December 2013 when ranked matchmaking was introduced to Dota 2. Ranked matchmaking was not a surprise, but it was immediately apparent that players cared more about their official Dota 2 matchmaking rating (MMR) than their NEL rating. This was confirmed after speaking to numerous NEL players, many of whom preferred the exclusivity of NEL but cared more about boosting their official MMR.

**The Solution**

Integrate Elite League ratings into Dota 2. IHLs require special attention to maintain the desired skill level and to discipline appropriately. This is not the same as 6k MMR matchmaking. Matchmaking is great for quickly starting a game that will be relatively balanced. 6k players are often matched with 4k players to balance the game. Sometimes this is exactly what players want, but sometimes they are willing to wait longer for a better game, especially when they can see who else is playing before committing. Elite Leagues also let the best players draft their teams, which has the potential to create more balanced teams with better chemistry than matchmaking.

**The Potential Outcome**

When I say NEL and the other Elite Leagues were thriving, I mean it. The NEL viewing experience was completely different from pro tournaments. NEL provides a more casual, yet highly competitive and innovative atmosphere. Industry leaders quickly took notice, we expanded to four continents, and had more interest from sponsors than we could have ever imagined. We were in a position to employ multiple hard working individuals full-time, which is no easy feat in the esports industry. And thats really what we want  to let people do what they love.
The past six months have been tough. Seeing your dream materialize before you, only to vanish in an instant is nothing but demoralizing. But we know we have something special. People want to play in IHLs. People want to watch IHLs. Because of this, IHLs will never truly die. But with one change, they could flourish.

**Testimonials**

"Well for me I was good and I kept playing inhouses. Eventually you form relationships with people if you play with them enough. In RMM it's a bit different. I said it earlier in some interview, RMM ladder isn't good for finding pro players, inhouses are much better. It's a better environment in almost every way."   Mason **mason** Venne, Evil Geniuses

I spammed IXDL games on the same hero and just hoped to play one of the practiced matchups versus a pro player in hopes of showing my talents off because there were a lot of observers in each IXDL game back in the day. Eventually, I was defeated by pro players in matches like Korok and Dendi which made me even more hungry to get better and crush them later on because I knew I could do it if I tried.  Artour **Arteezy** Babaev, Evil Geniuses

 I would like to say that back then I'm just a MM player who always stack with people like sN for example. I don't know what competitive was and my english skill is really low so I dont know much things about in house like people used to play (ixdl, NEL) and then I met Broodstar and he asked me to play ixdl but it wasn't fun for me and then I go back to MM. As the days progress I start to get bored of it and there was an announcement for NEL with prize pool so I decided to try it out and I got vouched by Broodstar but I was afraid to play with all those players because I thought my skills arent good enough but when I tried it, it was fun and people start to noticed me and like me based on my skills and good attitudes but what I think for myself Im not a very skilled player. I always have this dream that one day I want to play in competitive scene but my english wasnt good enough to communicate to people but NEL has brought me into competitive and it helps me building my english skills with people who plays this league and then it was ixmike88 who asked me to play completive after he saw my performance in the NEL because he thought I was a good player and ixmike88 has brought me into competitive scene. I'm also still playing in-houses like ixdl and NEL as long as there are people to play but the leagues need supports to get more people to play it. Big thanks to ixmike88.  Veasna **SNA** Sokhom, Sneaky Nyx Assassins

IHL's have always been a great way to introduce yourself into a competitive environment. For me in particular for being a South American player the level of play I could reach was limited due to the player skill around me. But thanks to the old IHL's back in Dota 1 I got to improve myself and join games with players way above my skill and because of it I was able to learn a lot and eventually grow as a player as well as making a name for myself. This helped me getting noticed and meeting new people who eventually would become my teammates.  William **Gudii** Aguilera, No Earthspirit

Inhouses are the best way to show your true potential and get good at professional Dota 2. You can always play with good players, players better than you, and that is the best way to achieve something, learning with the best. It has also a nice environment, you can always meet new people to play with, and there is no such thing as fake accounts. Another good thing about inhouses is the tickets system, many people watching you play around the world with casters is very good to show your skills and get known in the International Dota 2 scenario. -- Danilo "**Ned**" Silva, CNB e-Sports Club

I can pretty much say the only reason I'm going to compete at TI4 is because of ixmike88 and his inhouse leagues. A year ago it was only a dream of mine to compete professionally and I didn't think pro players would acknowledge me since I was a unknown player. That was until I started to play in NEL and slowly got my talent and potential recognized by pros and I eventually ended up standing in for the top tier NA teams and got asked to join teams after TI3. -- Arif "**MSS**" Anwar, mousesports

*********************************************************************************

" The role I played in DotA's development was as a bridge between Guinsoo and IceFrog. Essentially what had happened was Guinsoo had withdrawn from much effort on the map, having started a colossal upgrade but then having lost interest in the meantime. After a period of this where it was obvious the map was dying without updates or attention I forcibly took over the project from Guinsoo.

At this point I was the project head for a period of time. I never put my name on the map; I just changed it from "Guinsoo's DotA" to "DotA Allstars" and left it at that. This probably is why I'm relatively unknown. I did a lot of hero work; Pudge (my favorite), Earthshaker, Tiny 2.0, Bristleback, Sandking, Axe, Phantom Lancer 2.0, Stealth Assassin 2.0, Ursa Warrior, Broodmother, Shadow Fiend, Nerubian Weaver, Enchantress, Ogre Magi, Tinker, Necro'lic 2.0, Necrolyte, Enigma, and Death Prophet 2.0 would all either be dramatically different or not even in the game (although I've noticed a few have changed far beyond what I originally did). I also did a lot of quality of life work, like organizing icons and being the first to add tooltips to the item combinations. IceFrog at that point was one of the people I worked with; as he had formal programming training and I had none (I'm a biology graduate student) he was far more proficient than I when it came to computers.

After a few months of heading the project I became really disenchanted with the whole thing. I mostly did this for fun in my spare time while in college, but it was frustrating to spend hours of work on fixing bugs or coming up with novel ideas only to be ripped on for something else. So I basically dropped the thing (somewhat unfairly) on IceFrog's lap and left. Been interesting to see how it's evolved over the years and certainly best of luck to him in developing DotA with Valve.

Anyway, hope that helps fill in some of the holes in the history. "



*********************************************************************************


" Axe: Of my design. His original version didn't have Battle Hunger speeding Axe up, nor Culling Blade boosting ally movement. Probably good advancements since his original form had practically no pursuit power.

Bristleback: This was another guy's idea that was put in under my watch, where I had some input on the refinement of the idea but it was somebody else's baby.

Doom Bringer: Like Tiny, Doom Bringer was already in the game when I came around. I was just involved in giving him a facelift from his old version which was only a moderately changed Pit Lord from WarCraft 3 (although the new mechanic with him acquiring neutral abilities on Devour isn't mine, but is very cool).

Pudge: My pride and joy. What some of you might not know is that the current Pudge is actually the second Butcher that was put into the game. His first incarnation was as a summoner/pusher. He had the ability to store corpses like a Meat Wagon and then raise them. However, his ultimate was probably the most broken spell ever in DotA: Carrion Flies. The flies were a small, weak summon that were able to raise more of themselves. This would unfortunately result in Pudge being able to push an entire lane...while sitting in his base because the flies would increase in number faster than they'd die out. They were doubly horrible because they had no collision size so you'd see one fly....then die because it was actually 50 of them stacked on top of each other. Yeah, he got outright banned by people in public games.

It's been interesting to see how since his inception he's sort of permeated back into Blizzard's design. If you play World of WarCraft you'll notice that many of the abominations now have hooking moves and in Diablo 3 their Butcher also has a similar move.

Sandking: Of my design. His entire design came just from the fact that I found out that the scorpion models had a burrow animation and I really wanted to use it. He's probably one of my heroes that has gone through more changes than most, simply because he was such a boom-or-bust hero that was hard to balance. The original Epicenter stayed where it was cast, rather than following the Sandking. Slight adjustments in casting and stun times between Burrowstrike and Epicenter either made him way too powerful or completely incapable of getting his combo off.

Morphling: Of my design. First hero I ever got into DotA, while Guinsoo was still project head. He's also undergone quite a few changes like Sandking. His signature ability to convert Strength and Agility was there, as was Waveform, but that's about it. His ultimate is now Rubrick's (although my version was far more unwieldy to use) and I don't even recall what he had in place of Adaptive Strike.

Naga Siren: Already in game, I just invented her Song ultimate to replace whatever was there before (I don't even remember what it was).

Phantom Lancer: Of my design. Another case like Tiny where the hero was in before I came but was removed. I just brought it "back" using the original as an inspiration.

Stealth Assassin: Another case like Doom Bringer where the hero was in the game but I was involved in a heavy revamp. He already had perma-invis, but his old ultimate was Death Ward (same as the Witch Doctor except non-channeling). We nixed for the same reason Sandking had balance issues, where the hero's whole power depended on a single combo murdering the opponent before they could react. Smoke Screen and Backstab are my particular additions.

Ursa Warrior: Of my design. Fuzzy Wuzzy was the first hero to have a "secret" name. Fun fact is that his original version is that he was technically a ranged hero. Fury Swipes is based off of the Firelord's ability and the ability just wouldn't work when you put it on a melee hero. So he was actually a "ranged" hero in disguise to make it work.

Broodmother: Of my design. One of my personal favorites just because I like arthropods.

Nerubian Weaver: Of my design. In a twist of irony, I gave him a "useless" ability that ended up being removed and would probably have now been considered overpowered. I had the whole idea in my head of Shukuchi/Geminate/Time Lapse, but I couldn't think of a 4th ability that fit. After a while I basically gave up and awarded him the ability to summon invisible Shades which he could position around the map, giving him good vision of different areas. Yep, he had free everlasting mobile wards. Of course back then wards weren't in vogue (in fact, it was around my time that consumables were even introduced) so this ability was considered trash and skipped. I don't know when it was changed to the new swarm ability.

Shadow Fiend: Of my design. Ultimate has since been changed. His original ultimate was a set of orbs which floated around him that he could expand and contract, like a permanent version of the Guardian Wisp ability. I am however glad to see that Shadowraze has stayed around; it was an experimental ability that I knew was hard to control when I put it in, so glad to see that better players than I have made good use of it.

Enchantress: Of my design. Ultimate was originally Untouchable and Impetus was a basic ability, but other than that she still had the same set of abilities. Her healing ability is actually a variant of the War3 Crypt Lord swarm with a bunch of little units having auto-cast heal turned on. Recently picked up Dota 2 and she's probably one of my favorites to play as a support who can also sting when needed.

Keeper of the Light: I was involved in him, but I don't remember much else except working on Illuminate at some point. His original ultimate was an ungodly annoying pushing tool, a sort of Porta-Furion that could teleport around the map and summon support wisps to help fight.

Zeus: Already in the game, I just added in Static Field since he became rapidly useless past the early-mid game without the ability to weaken stronger opponents.

Tinker: Of my design. Fun fact is that Heat Seeking Missiles is Fan of Knives with a HUGE radius and small target limit. His ultimate actually stems from a limitation in the WarCraft 3 engine. There is no way to reset individual abilities in triggers, so you either reset everything or not. Otherwise he might have ended up quite differently.

Ogre Magi: Of my design.

Bane: I was involved in him. Like the Bristleback he was somebody else's baby, but I did the coding and refinement from the initial ideas.

Death Prophet: Already in the game, but I put in Witchcraft so that like Zeus her damage potential wouldn't just tank in the mid game against stronger heroes.

Enigma: Somebody else's idea, which I refined and coded. Blackhole, however, is my invention.

Necrolyte: Of my design. As a somewhat embarrassing anecdote, I was unaware of certain definitions when designing him. His original name was "Necrophiliac" since I figured he was affiliated with the dead. It was only brought to my attention later that I should probably rename him.

Visage: My version has since been overwritten. He was in the game previously and the gargoyles had always been his ultimate. I introduced Grave Chill as well as some other abilities to him. Soul Assumption is not of my design, nor is the new Gravekeeper's Cloak.

Misc.

Courier: Originally my idea. If the website lets me link URLs, I have a funny old picture of the original version equipped with a Dagon killing somebody (since it didn't have the limitations of the current couriers).

Items: I didn't do a lot with item invention, mostly I just sorted them. I did however introduce the Bracer and Wraith Band (originally Null Talisman was the only early game tri-stat) as well as the Refresher Orb (since it was basically the same idea as the Tinker).

And whew, I think that covers most of what I was involved in. "

Results of my Master thesis survey about why we buy skins in MOBA games.|self.DotA2|~Due to limited space the infographic and the full post contains more details and more facts than this Reddit post.

Repost from /r/leagueoflegends, I did not post it on the same time to avoid reddit hug, on the servers im hosting the content on.

The infographic for a quick overview: http://www.e-solution.dk/freemium-infographic/

Imgur mirror here: http://imgur.com/a/emOo1?reg

If you want to read the results in detail, you can find them here: http://www.e-solution.dk/freemium/

**Purpose:** To figure out one simple thing: **Why do people buy in-game virtual items that have no functionality at all?**. I decided that my case should be based around freemium MOBA games.  The idea is, that if you can figure out why people buy virtual items they dont need, then it might be possible for businesses selling actual services like Spotify, Dropbox and Skype. **MOBA games have a freemium to premium conversion rate on 90%!** Spotify got 33%, Skype 10% and Dropbox 1%. 

**Here are the results:**

**Demographics:** As stated in earlier studies, there is no difference between gamers buying behavior between Europe and America, the only slight difference is, that MOBA gamers from America enjoy buying skins more for the simple reason of fun, and had a higher score in the following statements (called hedonic motives): Skins are enjoyable and Skins are very entertaining than their European counterparts.

At the same time, there was a correlation between age and hedonic motives. Earlier studies from other businesses support this statement as well, which means, that the younger people are, the more they buy skins because it is fun. The difference is actually quite big.

I measured 6 factors that decide buying behavior. The way I found those factors was looking into previous studies for buying behavior in virtual worlds. I then made a pilot test where people would suggest why they bought skins, and it ended up being these 6 items that were relevant. Each factor was measured with 3-4 different questions, and what you see below are the averages of these questions. The item passed the hypothesis, with 2 out of 5.

**Hedonic motives (3,73 out of 5):** Hedonic motives are players that buy skins simply because it is fun and exciting. This was the highest factor.

**Customization (3,15 out of 5):** This was rated as the 2nd highest. Players bought skins to customize their gaming experience, or simply because they didnt like the classic skin. There is probably a business opportunity hidden here, by making original skins ugly. (Kidding... hopefully...). Fun fact, in World of Warcraft, one of the most used enchants in Vanilla (the first WoW game) was Beastslayer, it was completely useless (mostly), but the red glow was very appealing to people. People do a lot for cosmetics. There have been made academic papers about that topic. 

**Habit (2,55 out of 5):** simply because the price is low and it is easy to buy skins.

**Attention (2,06 out of 5):** Some people like attention, even though they dont want to admit it.

**To support esports (2,06 out of 5):** a lot of MOBA games is pouring a lot of money in the esport scene, people feel like they can support e-sport by supporting the games. The questions showed that players wanted mainly to support the game company (RIOT or VALVE), and werent that interested in supporting individual esports teams.

**Social pressure (1,78 out of 5 FAILED):** the answers showed that friends dont pressure each other to buy skins. However, the questionnaire showed that if you play with friends, you will buy more skins.

Negative factors are not significant, and didnt show to be important. **This means, that even if you disagree with the game company, you will still buy skins.**

**Gifting: 74% of the players bought gifts to friends**, and people who bought gifts, spend more money on the game in general!

I will lurk around in this thread and answer questions.

**TL:DR: Read the Infographic here: http://www.e-solution.dk/freemium-infographic/** 

Edit: Also note: that all who took the surveys, was from reddit and forums, that means that the people are probably highly engaged in the game.

Valve, We need a BIG BOT/BOOSTER Cleanup! It's also simple to implement!|self.DotA2|~##**The Issue**
Dota is being ruined! The game is being destroyed by botters and account boosters. Anyone who plays in ranked match making has surely come across an account buyer. Today I was "lucky" enough to come across another.

After checking the account on Dotabuff I was able to find a very simple pattern that these bots all share and I believe Valve could be doing more to either punish or prevent these accounts from ever reaching your games.


For the sake of proof i'll be using the following account to show you evidence of easy to find bots and boosted accounts. https://www.dotabuff.com/players/379058169
***
##**Easily Identifiable Proof of Botting**


The following is easily identifiable, I believe 

* [If you check the very first game you'll find that it's played in and against a bot 5 stack.](http://i.imgur.com/pCWHThm.jpg)


* [If you check the very last "Normal" game you'll find that it's played in and against the exact same bot 5 stack.](http://i.imgur.com/OtAAzoK.jpg)

* You'll also notice every one of these games take place on the [South Korean server](http://i.imgur.com/bKACo60.jpg).

* [Once the account has reached level 20 It then plays 10 ranked matches to calibrate.](http://i.imgur.com/tLzpjC1.jpg) You can see the difference between the bots playing and the actual human playing. These 10 matches are played on the[ Europe West server](http://i.imgur.com/wjLepnx.jpg).

* [After these 10 games and the account has been calibrated it is then sold to a player who is now excited to ruin your games! In this case, the account was sold to an Australian buyer who you can see struggles to play at the MMR the account was calibrated for.](http://i.imgur.com/yUx2vPZ.jpg)

***

At the time of writing this post the account and the new owner have ruined **71** ranked games and any wins on the account show that the owner was severely carried.

I'm sure Valve can easily input these above variables and flag multiple accounts that are this obvious. We might not be able to stop every account but Valve should be making it as hard as possible for this to take place.

***

**edit:** With a quick google you can even find the ad that the booster used to sell the account. [See here](http://i.imgur.com/f20ahwQ.jpg) The account was 4.8k when sold and has already fallen to ~~ 4.2k.

**edit 2:** If you take a look at the website where this account was sold - [See Here](http://i.imgur.com/yqF4ywM.jpg) - You can see 5000+ accounts sold in the first stickied thread. You can also see 250,000 views on the front page alone. All of these posts were commented on in the last day. Why is this so easy to do? Why can one person sell 5,000 accounts?

***

##**Hate Reading? - Video Here!**

Here's a video by ChiLongQua that he released just 2 weeks ago about the exact same issue. [See Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA-rFPpBDr8)

We need other Dota personalities to speak out about this issue!

***
How can Valve ignore such a huge issue that directly impacts Dota 2 and the player-base? If we don't fix this it'll only get worse!
***

##**Solution?**

Valve need to make it as hard as possible for the botter. The awesome thing about Valve developing Dota is that they also develop Steam and have access to the players library (or lack there of in this case). If we had an algorithm that looked for the following on an account and if it met every point then it was banned or even flagged as a possible bought account. Valve could then implement a fourth report item "Suspected purchased account" and if the account was already flagged by Valves automatic system and received 'X' reports from players then it lost the ability to play in ranked.

* New steam account, with only Dota 2 (Free games) on it.
* Friends on the account? Steam community set up on the account?
* No communication during games from Dota level 1 to 20.
* All games played in order to reach Dota level 1 to 20 are played in a party that dies 20+ times every game by constantly feeding.
* Level 1 - 20 games are played on server 'X'
* MMR Calibration are played on server 'Y'
* Games after 10 MMR calibration games are played on server 'Z'

The above won't catch every account but every time Valve make it harder and more time consuming for a user to profit off of this then they're closer to making the effort required higher than the reward received in which case people will cease to do it.

Even if they looked at the data like the account received a hat for a hero whilst they were in their level 1 - 20 games and they didn't equip it or they didn't even view the notification then it gets flagged to complete a simple captcha (Think Dota2 recipe game type Captcha)

**Machine learning?** - Would it be difficult for Valve to teach a computer system what's a player and what's a dumb bot used to level an account? 
-

* Players communicate with one another
* Players buy real items and follow a 'relative' build per hero
* Players interact with the map and ward/ping
* Players report and commend one another
* Players have 'X' APM
* Bots don't watch live games in the client
* Bots feed multiple kills all game and have 0/50+ K/D/A
* Bots don't communicate
* Bots don't report or commend
* Current bots used to level don't act human in the slightest

You'd only have to check this on accounts who sit at level 1-20 or who have gone from 1-20 in a short period of time. Even if someone eventually was able to make the bots pass all the above then they've at least had to work for it. They've spent time making the bot bypass the system whereas they would have just been producing and selling accounts in that same time period.

##**So How Does Google Do It??**
If Google can tell the difference between a human and a bot that's only purpose is to solve captcha based purely off of mouse movement on a website then why can't Valve tell the difference between a human and a dumb bot in something as intricate and complex as a 30+ minute game of Dota? 

The whole reason we have [reCAPTCHA](https://imgur.com/5PRzsXf.jpg) is because Google observes a users interactions and determines if it is a computer or a human and if it's unsure it just asks you. 

> One advantage that Google has over other companies is huge amount of data. That data also includes the way you move your mouse on the screen.
The way a human moves the mouse before checking the checkbox can be distinct from how a program (a bot) checks a checkbox.
It's a game of prediction. Somehow, Google needs to predict whether you are human or a bot from what you do on their site.
So first a system needs to be trained to predict whether the user is human or not. For this you need training data (which Google has plenty). That data includes sample movements of mouse made by humans as well as robots (programs). Using this training data, a predictive model is made.
So when you move your mouse to check the checkbox. That movement is an input to the model and based on that it's predicted whether you are human or not. If you are then fine, otherwise the same old method of filtering humans through a distorted image is used.


Based purely on that you could look at how bots accept a match and probably get rid of half of them right away. Valve could implement this into the main client. How many times does a bot visit the Heroes page or the Store? Probably never! Why doesn't Valve look at mouse movement in the client whilst the game is taking place?. There is so much that could be done, just need to start somewhere!
 
I'm also positive Valve could design and implement a much better system than what I've listed above with what they have at their disposal.

An analysis of climate change in DotA2: increased pick rates of climate-endangering TI6 meta heroes negatively impacts a vulnerable hero sub-population.|self.DotA2|~**TL;DR:** The TI6 meta led to increased pick rates of environmentally harmful heroes, which in turn negatively affected the success of a hero sub-population.

Before I begin, I humbly ask anyone who would be willing to take a few minutes of their time to [please fill out this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaZc13dWRtvlsSPJalQQuyn_ZI-6mbVDOH9nEttU3rjcob1g/viewform)
for an upcoming analysis. I appreciate your help, thank you very much!

Hello Everyone,

Another International has come and passed, and in its wake has left the typical passion, excitement, and of course, monetary rewards. The typical fan finds themselves caught up in this gaming whirlwind without thinking about many of the secondary effects that ripple from each TI. Hero picks in public games often become influenced by the unique meta that blossomed within the tournament. Granted, while nearly all of the available heroes were picked this TI, there are obvious standouts that were picked most oftenthis doesnt go unnoticed by the millions tuning in. When heroes are over-represented in such a high profile public showing, it is expected that those trends may carry-over into public games. This analysis seeks to study some of these trends from TI6, and explore the potential dangers that they may pose to some of DotA2s most vulnerable heroes.

Climate change has become an increasingly recognizable threat to the planet. Whatever your beliefs are concerning its cause, overwhelming scientific evidence suggests it is happening. However, the lasting effects of climate change are not immediately obvious. While recent data shows the past months/years as being the hottest on record, we only have predictions and models to hypothesize what detrimental changes might take place in the next 50+ years. This includes sea levels rising, water supplies becoming short, air pollution, and the like. To many, the immediate effects of climate change are more opaque, and there are less drastic concerns to point at and say, Look at this horrible thing! Sure, we may get [the occasional reminder that snow will melt indoors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E0a_60PMR8), or that somewhere out there in the Arctic theres a polar bear missing out on the smooth refreshing taste of a Coca-Cola because of too small, few and far between ice floats, but those arent exactly pressing concerns. Regardless, the most notable examples of now-impacting climate change are already vulnerable species, or those who are becoming increasingly threatened due to changes in their environment via climate change.

Whether players think about it or not, DotA2 has its own natural environment. A diverse set of living beings inhabit a world filled with extensive forest, flowing water, and unique geological topography. As such, it stands to reason that this ecosystem and its inhabitants could be affected by hero-made climate change. As an example, Treant Protector (a tree who utilizes other trees for survival), might be negatively influenced by heroes causing deforestation such as Engima (midnight pulse). Worrisomely, the aforementioned over-represented meta heroes this International have the potential to negatively impact the climate. **Therefore, I hypothesize that the increase of climate-endangering heroes in public games, as a result of their popularity in TI6, directly leads to negative outcomes for heroes especially vulnerable to these micro environmental fluctuations.**

For the purposes of this study, I chose four (4) meta heroes prominently featured in TI6: Batrider, Shadow Demon, Timbersaw, and Elder Titan. As a result of these heroes popularity among drafters, a clearly observable increase in their pick rates is observed during TI6 ([Figure 1](http://imgur.com/a/RkmiY)). These four heroes each contributes to climate change as follows:

**Timbersaw:** Widely considered the principal culprit and chief advocate of deforestation, this chain-saw wielding imp causes the highest rate of tree-loss per hour out of all heroes. As if that wasnt enough, a constant stream of pollution bellows from his engine in the form of soot-black emissions.

**Batrider:** Instead of slowly trapping heat in the atmosphere via greenhouse gasses, Batrider cuts out the middle-man and simply engulfs the map in flames. His spread of long-lasting fires, not to mention disgusting black tar, leaves irreparable damage in its wake. And while hes not quite as bad as Timbersaw, this bat rider is no friend to trees either.

**Shadow Demon:** Shadow Demons influences on climate change may not be outwardly as obvious as the previous two heroes. While he doesnt release pollution or set the world on fire, he does contribute to another key area of climate concern; overpopulation. With an ability to directly clone another hero (twice!) Shadow Demon not only effectively triples the hero population, but also increases the size of that populations eco-footprint three fold ([Figure 2](http://imgur.com/a/smAPX)).

**Elder Titan:** Yeah, like ripping a giant gash in the earth isnt going to cause problems.

Having outlined the potential climate-harming effects of the above heroes, and having shown their increased pick rates, I then picked four (4) of what I postulated to be the most susceptible heroes to these changes. If we consider warming, then ice heroes (like polar bears) are likely to see more immediate impacts on their overall success due to increased pick rates of climate-detrimental heroes. Therefore, the win-rates of Ancient Apparition, Crystal Maiden, Tusk, and Winter Wyvern were closely examined for changes as a result of TI6-influenced hero trends. The results are presented here in [Figure 3](http://imgur.com/a/HIrEW).

Alarmingly, each ice hero shows a significant drop in winning percentage during the same time period in which the climate-harming TI6 meta heroes saw a bump in pick rates. It was not altogether surprising to see already vulnerable heroes like Tusk, who had an established low win-rate (41%), be further harmed by climate change. What is more shocking, however, is that even an otherwise successful ice hero like Crystal Maiden (55% win rate) saw a dip in her success as well. **These results highlight the very immediate short-term consequences of DotA2 climate change on threatened hero populations.**

While these consequences were partially mitigated in correlation with decreased pick rates of climate-damaging heroes, it is important to consider the possible long term effects of picking heroes who promote climate change. By using advanced statistical algorithms and predictive modeling, I calculated how the win rates of the four ice heroes might look in the next 50 years if environmentally-destructive heroes continued to be pick at high rates ([Figure 4](http://imgur.com/a/wfrrM)). These models present a bleak, stark future; a world in which some of our most treasured and endangered heroes could never win a game of DotA2 again.

In conclusion, these data present the first evidence to date of climate change negatively impacting heroes within the DotA2 environment. Importantly, these negative effects seemed to be a result of environmentally unfriendly heroes being picked at higher rates. This in itself was a result of hero trends that became popularized by the TI6 meta. **The DotA2 public as a whole has a responsibility to reduce their use of climate-harming heroes, while prioritizing more eco-friendly ones. Even more so, the professionals who are so often idolized and emulated must be conscious of their drafts, and be aware the public will follow their lead.** All it takes is one set of polluting heroes to cause harm to our DotA2 world. Thank you for reading, and I look forward to your comments.~|article

**A little bit competitive**:

* Navi have just lost to Fnatic at starladder minor, they're very unfortunate at the moment. Optic, VGJ.T, Vega Squadron, Fnatic advanced to playoffs, Navi are out

* Virtus.pro are playing very well(having won 3 majors, and placed top-3 at DAC)

* Liquid didn't make it to top-4 at the previous major(DAC 2018), causing them to lose the streak.

* w33 joined Pain Gaming


* We're not yet satisfied with EG's performance, but we hope it will change in the future


* Optic have to prove a lot, promising team.

Stop telling new players that choosing mid or "high impact heroes" will increase their mmr|self.DotA2|~I don't know if it's the vocal minority or what, but this is getting ridiculous. You don't have to play the carry in order to force the outcome of your game to be a victory, and the reason why should be obvious. The amount of times I've seen this sub complain about 5 carry teams is proof that having supports will improve your teams chances of winning. That's because they're important. (I.E not "low-impact" as I saw someone in this sub calling them)

So my problem here is the cult-ridden fascination with people demanding that you just "Go mid, stomp, win your lane, win the game" in order to improve. That's not improving the same way that playing Riki every single game doesn't help new players improve. 

You can have a high impact on whatever hero you want. And no, I don't mean you carry with a support, I mean you buy the wards, roam the map, create space so that someone else can carry you. Because believe me there are going to be people who will volunteer to play the carry role. And if you are successful at creating space/ making the game hell for the other team, then you will have formed an impact. This is not to discredit the mid role, I fucking love playing mid. 

But if you're going to tell me that Akke's Chen didn't have an impact, if Pieliedie's Wisp was just worthless, if Chuan's Enchantress didn't blow you away, if Maelk's Venomancer didn't send chills down your fucking spine and win the day...

You want to know how to raise your mmr? Play the damn game.

Edit: Some people have been saying that this post is saying, "Choose support every game." It's not. But in the discussion of high-impact heroes, supports should not be left out. Abaddon and Lich have the second highest winrates in the game atm, it's gotta be for a reason. If you don't want to play support, fine. Then don't. But do not use the excuse of "Supports just don't do anything." Dota is a team game, to win you need to play like a team.~|article

An in depth analysis of Silencer: Does he really want us all to shut up?|self.DotA2|~**Introduction**

Silencer has long been one of my favorite heroes. The general design of the hero is to efficiently make your opponents shut up while also, over time, dumbing them down to the point where they can no longer muster any words, allowing you can happily put them out of their misery via your idiot-killer glaives. 

However, does Silencer truly want to shut people up, or is his persona a ruse in order to hide an ulterior, more sinister motive? Let's find out.

**Analysis: Voice lines**

Let's take a look at Silencer's voice lines. By my count, there are 270 voice lines for Silencer. Now, we search his voice lines for evidence of attempts at silencing the enemy; words like "silence" or "quiet" or lines containing "shh" count towards this. 



Phrase or expression | Count | Percentage of total voice lines | 
---|---|----|
"Shh" | 8 | 2.96% | 
"Hush", "Shush" | 3 | 1.11% | 
"Silence" (excluding refrences to Silencer himself) | 18 | 6.66% | 
"Quiet" | 7 | 2.59% | 
"Shut" (up, it) | 6 | 2.22% | 
"Hear", in the context of not hearing anything (ex. "I don't even want to hear it") | 8 | 2.96% | 
[Lines referring to silencing Storm Spirit](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/78/Silen_rival_07.mp3) | 1 | 0.37%| 
**Total** | **51**| **18.89%** | 


As clearly shown by the data, only 18.89% of Silencer's lines, less than 1/5 of them, actually refer to silence or silencing enemies. What do the rest of them refer to?

Phrase or expression | Count | Percentage of total voice lines | 
---|---|----|
"Ha", or general laughter | 23 | 8.52% | 
"Uh!", "Oh!", and other expressions of pain | 18 | 6.67% | 
Lines containing an exclamation point (Which implies loudness, not silence) (excludes lines contained in previous set of data) | 54 | 20.00% |  
**Total** | **95**| **35.19%** | 

This is shocking data. 35% of Silencer's voice lines involve a loud expression of laughter, pain, or otherwise exclamatory action. This is nearly double the amount of lines referring to silent actions. This discovery led me to investigate further, this time into Silencer's multitude of motions in game.

**Analysis: In game movements**

For simplicity's sake in testing, I used one of my unused effigies from TI4 (Let's be honest, who cares about these things anyways other than for stupid poses and memes). Of the thirteen available animations which are usable for posing, only one, the VICTORY animation, contained any traces of Silencer motioning to silence an enemy. [Seen here](http://imgur.com/sfmSZUk), the pose shows Silencer sticking his index finger in front of his lips, a common motion used to tell others to be quiet. With this one animation only being 7.69% of the available animations, it is clear that Silencer does not spend a majority of his time trying to silence others.

**Conclusions: What is Silencer's true motive?**

It is clear through the collected data that Silencer's main motives, as demonstrated through his voice lines and in-game motions, do not actually involve Silencing others. 

My theory, based on the relative data, is that Silencer is not concerned with Silencing others, but concerned more with making sure he can talk more than others. The frequency of laughter lines, and even his ability, "Last Word", imply that Silencer is, in fact, very concerned with getting the final say in a conversation, even with his enemies. By stealing intelligence and gaining it himself, he is able to gain quick wits and a way with words that no other hero can accomplish, while simultaneously making his opponents dumber and unable to come up with an adequate response. He frequently uses exclamatory statements to emphasize his own importance, while pushing down others, too.

Please, I would love to hear your counterarguments in the comments. I look forward to discussing this issue. 

TL;DR: Silencer doesn't want people to shut up, he wants to act better than others while laughing at them.

To know ACE, records from their meeting.|self.DotA2|~Hi, there, I'd like to introduce **Association of China E-sports (ACE)** to all of you through some screenshots of chat log from their meeting.

**left**: Worse more, VALVE always stands by players' side.  

**left**: Because they are WINGS, people will definitely stand by their side.

**left**: Clubs should have more control on their contract players and ACE should care more about club's interests. In the future, ACE also needs to define clearly about contract termination.

**VK**: Did ex-wings players signed ACE regulations or not? 

**VK**: Not?   

**VK**: So we need to confirm whether they signed it or not.

**left**: In the future, no one will feel confident to invest money in clubs because they(ex-wings players) terminated contract that way.

**left**: I suggest that we protect clubs interests.

[screenshot 4](http://imgur.com/a/gMWD6) translation:

**left**: Yesterday one boss of a club expressed the worry about things like this. A non-ACE club can easily destroy one ACE club this way, because all he needs to do is to sign all the players and form a team with a different name.   

**left**: Even they(ex-wings players) followed Chinese Labor Law, they still need to wait for a a court judgment or arbitration. [(This is a lie)](http://redd.it/6czrnp)

**VK**: What ACE can do is only a ban, nothing else.

**VK**: Anything else?

**VK**: According to Chinese Labor Law, they(ex-wings players) are certainly free to leave. 

**VK**: But this is bullshit.   

**left**: We need to explain this issue to all dota fans.

**left**: In my opinion, all clubs should follow ACE regulations. Under this condition, players can follow their own regulation. ACE is founded in order to help both clubs and players. If one of them does not follow ACE regulations, ACE should punish it.

**VK**: Is the representative from wings here?

**left**: Not here.

[screenshot 10](http://imgur.com/a/OFFrl) translation:

**left**: We should consider carefully here.

**left**: A lifelong ban, or 2 years? 

**left**: If we ban them permanently, we feel we will be unfavorable to public opinion.

**left**: This is just a private agreement. We can act as if there is no regulation to judge this issue. No one says that we are not allowed to accept these players. The only problem is that we do not welcome these players.

**left**: Yeah, its not the case that we are prohibited to accept them. We are unwilling to accept them.

[screenshot 11](http://imgur.com/a/a0A7Q) translation:

**left**: It is not the fear of punishment from ACE that prevents us from accepting them (ex-wings players). 

**left**: It is not the punishment from ACE.

Greetings! Do you want to build the best PC for Dota 2?|self.DotA2|~Greetings, /r/DotA2!

Dota 2 is quite easy on the hardware, and most PCs that are "mid-tier" or above can max it out. I have written an article on ["Building the Best PC for Dota 2"](http://www.logicalincrements.com/games/dota2/), to show what hardware you need to have, and how different settings affect the look of the game.

Please let me know if the article is helpful. Your comments, suggestions, and criticisms are appreciated!~|article
give your struggling PMA attitude a 180 with AMP: Adaptive Mental Posture|self.DotA2|~Edit; for a TL;DR, just scroll down to "the solution" section, and the table below it to get the principles of AMP without the discussion/setup.

Positive Mental Attitude (PMA) was a wonderful concept.  That one should approach each game with optimism and maintain it throughout, while ideally leading your team to victory by preventing tilt.  Up front, this is still a good idea, and I support optimistic attitudes.  Unfortunately, *PMA is a stale concept and we need a mental attitude refresh.* The problems arise when most players simply cant maintain PMA, or use it as a shield to demand happy compliance from their teammates without regard to their teammates abilities.  PMA now carries an implicit assumption that constant communication, strategic discussion, and advice to teammates is a core, continuous function of the PMA player.  Unfortunately, this ideal often fails to materialize.  While personalities like Slacks execute PMA with genuine good attitude (mostly) and simply keep high morale, most players translate PMA into the belief that they must personally drive all 5 heroes to victory in gameplay aspects, not just morale aspects.  *This is wrong,* and its increasingly ruining games as people stray further from the base idea.

Look, I know.  *You are a high information player.* You watch pro games. You study replays from the top players.  You used promocode BSJ.  You read my guide on /r/learndota2 about depth analysis, and memorized the Great Dota Novel written by /u/circis1 on Thought Process of a 6k.  You post to or read /r/truedota2. And mostly, high information is a great thing.  Reviewing and analyzing lower mmr players games over at LD2, people are buying smoke and dust in 2k and 3k.  Theyre getting BKB at all MMRs (granted, not always at the right time).  Raw game knowledge, even for low information players, is increasing massively. The focus of what makes a good dota player is changing from rote knowledge of itemization to execution knowledge of timing and mechanical skill at all levels.

#The Problem:

*"High-information players" (ones that read guides, watch videos and pro games, etc.) are increasingly vocal and angry about attempting to control their teams decisions based on what they know about competitive/pro dota, across all brackets, and increasingly allowing it to influence their attitude and play from the draft screen.* PMA has become a watchword for entitled Dota players to use as a shield to demand compliance from teammates they should consider equals.  Too many high information players expect that they have a duty, and even a right, to lead their team. As a result, they tilt themselves, and their team, by being overbearing with strategic advice and constant criticism of four other players. Additionally, they assume that allies should follow their suggestions and have the same beliefs about proper Dota as they do, insistently arguing over actions they disagree with, as early as the draft screen.  More to the point, these players in lower brackets are often outright wrong with their suggestions or *overvalue complex professional draft choices compared to key fundamentals like damage, disable, and actual player skill in pub games.*

How often has a game gone like this?

Edit: *shortened the example*
Draft starts -- enemy LC: Ally Void: enemy Pudge: ally Mid Arc: enemy Storm.  Ally carry is showing Drow and other ally is showing dazzle safelane, our example high information player still hasnt placed lane marker *because they want to see what counters enemy best,* but they repeatedly request that ally pick a more durable carry. They draft their own hero 3rd after enemy storm They pick Skywrath Mage because they think SWM Ult counters duel and synergizes with chrono, and has a long silence for storm.  They then get very angry when ally picks Drow anyways, using the remaining draft period to type multiple lines of invective why the pick was bad.  So, they enter the game angry their team is at fault for draft issues, while proud of their own pick. Already, they have created an implicit mental entitlement: their pick is better, so theyre the better player But once the horn sounds, because they arent that great on positioning with SWM, they spend literally the entire game dying to duel, hook, and vortex with no hope of ever accomplishing anything that they set out to do.  Rather than accept their decision might not have been optimal, because *after all they picked the best counter to enemy lineup,* they open a mic channel and demand their team do a better job of succeeding for them.  They rage that Drow was a poor pick (in fairness it is, but crucially, they saw it coming before their own pick, and could have picked a better complement). Never mind that they picked the SWM into an allied team that could have used a better disabling support, and 3 excellent burst gank heroes. The game ends in a loss and they console themselves by [refreshing their counterpicking website which supports their SWM choice]( http://dotapicker.com/herocounter#!/E_Storm_Spirit/E_Legion_Commander/E_Pudge/T_Faceless_Void) and saying well it couldnt have been my fault then, I picked the right hero, my allies must have played the game wrong.

&nbsp;

This is an absolutely abysmal way to play Dota and for some reason I have seen it *constantly* recently. Every game there is someone on microphone from pre horn to game end letting all 4 of the rest of us know just how wrong were playing compared to the choices they would have made.  Sometimes they have the right idea, most times, theyre idiots. But no matter if theyre technically correct or not, they inevitably tilt themselves or their allies with the constant stream of commentary and criticism. They disrupt and discourage needed tactical communication, and often get muted and become useless to the team.

#The Solution: Adaptive Mental Posture (AMP)

Being AMPed (Adaptively Mentally PosturED) refocuses your mental game on the one thing you control, yourself.  Its also conveniently the reverse acronym from PMAtotally a coincidence though.  Getting AMPed up can be described by the following principles:

1\. AMPed players **Assume allies are equals, even if their playstyle is badly misaligned with their own.**  Adaptive players understand that equal MMR means equal overall skill, but that that there are so many different skillsets in dota, that every game requires a fresh analysis of each player in the game.  They do not overestimate their skill or ability to plan strategic choices compared to their allies; instead, they analyze each game from a neutral perspective that starts from the assumption that all 10 players are about as good as their MMR should indicate (respective large MMR differential games, and party MMR games).

2a\. AMPed players **Seek to identify and take advantage of more mistakes than their opponent can of them,** which is the core definition of being better at Dota than your opponent.  Whether in positioning, itemization, or game pace, Adaptive players actively understand how each game and player has a unique mix of aggression, defense, and opportunity based on the strengths and weaknesses of their allies and enemies. Each game presents a unique mix of opportunity and threat, not a blanket set of rules from game to game. 

2b\. Conversely, AMPed Players **always seek the advantage in teammate decisions they disagree with.** A Lion may farm aghs, or 2 allies may die pushing stupidly; this is not an opportunity to convince them of your supposed superiority, but to capitalize on what they did do, whether thats simply to create space to take advantage of, or to delay the game for an unnecessary but still usable itemization advantage. 

3\. AMPed players **lead by example, particularly by minimizing foreseeable deaths** while farming, warding, positioning before teamfights, and initiating. The Adaptive player should ideally never be picked off, because they should constantly be mindful of enemy capability and adapt their movements to avoid obvious enemy threats. Adaptive players do not initiate first and check minimap for allied support second; they always make a decision based on the actual actions of their team, not what they want them to be.

4\. AMPed players **never rely on their teammates to follow a preconceived game plan for roles, draft, and game pace.**  They understand that guides, pro meta, and Dota theory are guidelines for good play, not team rules followed in every pub.  Instead, they mitigate team weaknesses and augment strengths by adapting to the reality of each game.  They apply their knowledge to make light suggestions and gain individual advantage.

5\. AMPed players **do not attempt to continuously dictate strategic direction, or ongoing critique of teammates, recognizing that it is impossible to teach anyone in a single game.** Instead, AMPed players focus on their own play, and understanding how to fit their gameplay in to suboptimal choices by their allies.  Allied mistakes, perceived or actual, should be taken as a simple picture of game state, not a value judgement.

6a\. AMPed players **understand why hero pool is important,** as timings, itemization, and game adaptations become much more readily apparent when hero familiarity is a given. They have a pool of high, medium, and low familiarity picks which cover at least 2 roles with multiple subroles.

6b\. AMPed players **do not attempt to force hero or role choices on allies because they recognize that allies may not have that hero or role in their pool,** and do not pick unfamiliar heroes solely to counter enemy picks.

7\. AMPed players SDOP their enemies during draft: **Sustain, Disable, Outdamage, Push is the mantra of draft priority in public matchmaking.** Utility heroes with good farm potential which can buy a wide range of team-fighting items (which often enable sustain, disable, and push), are valued to fill critical gaps in drafts.

8\. AMPed players **communicate in short, tactical bursts, when decision points are critical.**  Item timings, suggested objectives or items, warnings about impending initiation, and cooldown/mana/hp are key informational points for teammates. Idle strategic assessment, musings, and critical comments to teammates simply serve to distract from attention to game state. *If a tactical decision is ignored by the team, the Adaptive player modifies their plan to accommodate the choice made by the team/ally and does not press the issue.*

9\. AMPed players **concentrate fully on the best choices they can make for THEIR hero, not what others should be doing.**  Have a plan for core items, and understand the difference between core+situational items. Dont outplay yourself by neglecting a core item on a carry just to counter an enemy team.  Adaptive players only rarely recommend item purchases to team, and do so only once or twice to communicate intent.

10\. AMPed players **shut up and play the game the best they can.** They respond only to tactical requirements and lighthearted banter.  Adaptive players maximize use of quick chat options like the chat wheel and alt and ctrl-alt pings to minimize time spent communicating and maximizing time spent concentrating on game state.

&nbsp;

Once you **get AMPed,** You will focus primarily on making the best decisions for your own draft pick and playstyle, concentrating on identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each team you are placed with and against, and molding your own decisions to capitalize on bad enemy decisions and all allied decisions, regardless of whether they fit in to a preconceived game framework.  *Realize that it is not possible to mold your teammates ideas of Dota to yours, nor do you have any authority or special skill to do so, in the duration of the draft or one game of Dota.* Any attempt to do more than give simple suggestions or provide tactical communication is a waste of effort and attention that you could be putting in to playing your own hero better.

In short, no matter the insane decisions of your team or the enemy, your mental state will be not to inform, force, or deny those choices, but to constantly update your mental understanding of the game you're currently playing to capitalize on the game state in any way you can: by doing this you avoid the tilting confrontations of "PMA inspired" team captaining, and instead learn that the real way to win is by simply playing through these issues in the best way **you** can.

**Get AMPed to win.**

#Afterword: Signs you may need to get AMPed, and principles to address your weaknesses

Ways your mental state hurts you | AMP Principles to consider | Explanation
:--|:-:|:--                                  
My team is Peruvian/Russian/Turkish/Pinoy/Redditors/Etc. | (2a,b), (4), (5), (6b), (9) | Look, I get it, but the whole point of this system is to make you focus on working *around* people with different playstyles, not trying to change them.
Youre already tilted by the draft|(1), (4), (6) | Youd rather have someone on a hero theyre comfortable with for a shot at performing, than force them to pick what you want and play it badly. That player could be an absolute monster on that hero, its not your job to say otherwise before the game starts.
Your draft is currently a disaster | (4), (7) | Fill the SDOP gaps, even if it means youre the one picking a jungler to augment physical damage or carry potential. Its better to have the right tools than to blindly adhere to proper dota; the draft is probably already improper.  
You often find yourself arguing over your suggestions | (5), (8), (9), (10) | Every line after the first suggestion is a missed last hit, a potential to die while distracted, or a failure to check the minimap or enemy inventories
You often spend considerable time informing your team what their next move should be | (1), (2b), (5), (10) | It is not your job to do this. It is your job to adapt to and augment decisions, whether they are in line with your idea of proper dota or not
You often focus on perceived bad strategic choices (gank vs. push, itemization), regardless of the current KDA/GPM of the player, or disregard the possible benefits of their choice | (2b), (4), (9) | Just because Bloodseeker went brown boots into dagon, hes still 5-0, which means that enemies spent a lot of time dying, not pressuring you did you take advantage of that time to get ahead, or did you just complain about the Dagon?
You sometimes literally die while talking or typing | (3), (10) | Seriously? This happens WAY more often than it should
You believe your positioning and knowledge skills are more valuable than the actual execution (button pressing) of the game | (1), (5), (9) | Maybe they are, but if so, lead by example and prove it with your gameplay, not with your words backed up by an empty KDA. No positioning in the world fixes missed hooks and doomed creeps
You dont believe in, or dont believe you have, a hero pool. Or you believe that your hero pool is very large, or irrelevant, given your ability to understand the game properly at a macro level. | (6a), (7), (9) | Youre simply wrong. Hero familiarity is a massive determinant of your ability to apply yourself to a match the more time you spend calculating the range on a stun, the less time you spend considering if its a good idea in the first place.
You often incorrectly over-apply knowledge to the wrong situation | (2), (6a), (7) | Some players over adapt to be clever, such as a core running brown boots -> MKB just because of an enemy PA, or counter drafting on unfamiliar heroes because of a website recommendation. Understanding why core items are core to a hero, and your own limits in skill and hero pool, vastly mitigate this risk.
You often believe that the choices of your allies lost the game, and more specifically, that it would have been a victory had they just listened to you | (1), (2b), (3), (4), (5), (6b), (8), (9), (10) | Fundamental to AMP is understanding that there are many situations where players claim the fault lies with their allies not helping, but simply aligning yourself to the games pacing instead of forcing your own pace on it would have solved the problem right away. My best skill is making my team listen is not a consistent winning strategy in public games.

Situational Warding: Ward for what you need, not just in "good" spots.|self.DotA2|~Edit:  Updated with pictures by popular demand.  Credit to ()_NeOn_GeNeSis_ for his Steam guide which I lifted from heavily.  Again, my picture references are not an exhaustive list...just the most obvious wards for what I'm talking about.

...

As someone who just about exclusively supports, I wanted to give a little perspective on warding that I feel most folks are missing, even at high levels (5K+).

Warding isn't just about knowing where "good" ward spots are.  There are dozens of maps and videos you can watch that will show you where all the spots are that give you optimal vision of various things...~~~~I won't be covering that~~~~ Common examples included below.  [THIS is an exhaustive list, however](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=358789918).

Instead, I want to highlight WHY you should choose a specific ward position based on what's going on in the game.  I'll break these down into specific ward categories:  **Rosh Ward**, **Objective Ward** (Offensive/Defensive), **Jungle Ward** (Offensive/Defensive), **Lane Ward** and **Mid Ward**.  Even these aren't ALL the reasons you'd want to ward, but it should give you a really solid foundation to build upon if you're still the person who just wards the runes for 30 minutes and maybe the designated ward spots when you have the appropriate map control.

**Rosh Ward**

First things first, your Rosh ward should just about always give you rune vision, so this is a high priority ward location.  There are really only 4 spots to ward that give this vision appropriately (2 on Dire, 2 on Radiant) so dewarding is fairly straightforward.  If they have a ward there, a pair of sentries WILL find them.

Radiant Side 2:  [Here](http://imgur.com/bZqbkjW) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/LJAwYwm.jpg).  One sentry can hit both of these.

Dire Side 2:  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/wiQD5dL.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/VdEwj4j.jpg).  One sentry can hit both of these.

There are secondary locations that can scout Rosh, but they are rarely used (even at high levels).  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/5qlgk7w.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/jcXf4T3.jpg).  This last ward of course is used all the time...just not to scout Rosh, and usually not past 15 minutes.

Good times for this ward:

* Enemy has an early Rosh hero (8-12 minutes for folks like Troll/Ursa/Lycan)
* When you know Rosh is spawning, you want a ward here

...in general this is a very high priority ward spot.  If you're completely unsure of where to ward, this is always a safe bet.

**Mid Ward**

This ward is meant to be placed uphill on the enemy side of the river (ideally) to give you better vision on the mid.  You can place this either immediately uphill in the middle of the lane, or just on the uphill outside edges of mid that still give you vision of mid.  [Like this](http://imgur.com/WccJBK9) or [like this](http://i.imgur.com/tx8pwRQ.jpg) (opposite for other side).

This same ward is also a good objective ward for mid tower, but I'll cover that in a sec.

Good times for this ward:

* When you need uphill vision to establish if it's safe to gank, or allow a gank setup (SB charge, execute, Axe blink, etc etc).
* When your mid is constantly getting rotated on by the other team's jungler or supports through mid.

**Objective Warding**

These wards are meant to give you an advantage when your team is pressing an objective (Tower/Rax).  Instead of blindly pushing a tower and rolling the dice on who's around to defend, you can spend a ward to give you a much better chance to knock that objective down.  You'll be placing these wards in spots that at least give you vision of any potential TPs to that tower.  Generally this is behind the Bot/Top T1s ([like this](http://i.imgur.com/rQUJi6F.jpg)) or some high ground location at the T2s ([like this](http://i.imgur.com/UkO6o5F.jpg) or [like this](http://i.imgur.com/UgESVmy.jpg)).  You may also want to ward the path TO that tower if you're more worried about roaming rotations vs. TPs.

These are more typically mid-game wards vs. early game.

Unsure if it's well known (it should be), but you can ward inside the enemy base from the outside [like this](http://i.imgur.com/OPw2IbW.jpg).

Good times for this ward:

* If you're not sure where the enemy is and it's a risky tower push
* If you think there is going to be a teamfight, to help setup initiation or scout enemy initiators
* Everytime you're pushing rax and know a teamfight will breakout

This applies both offensively and defensively.  If you're getting pushed and you want to prioritize keeping that objective, you'll want to do these same wards, for the opposite reasons (seeing who's pushing, scouting initiation).

**Lane Ward**

This ward is placed between objectives, but most commonly refers to a ward placed between your T1 and the enemy T1 towers, close to their T1 where you could see rotations/TPs.

This is basically your safety net for your safelane carry to ensure they can farm safely if you aren't there or quickly flee if they see a rotation coming.  It looks [like this](http://imgur.com/Gf6qcZn) or [like this](http://i.imgur.com/87vPp8q.jpg)

Good times for this ward:

* Your lane is "won" for the carry (they can farm safely without you) and you're now roaming full time.
* Your lane is heavily contested and you need to scout TP rotations

**Jungle Ward**

Defensively, these are your "get map control back" wards.  Offensively these are your "gank setup" or "where the hell is that jungle farming hero" ward.

This isn't the "block camps" type of ward that I'm talking about.  This is placing a ward in the jungle at a chokepoint somewhere where you'll be able to see if the enemy is farming their jungle or rotating through it.

Main Dire Spots:  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/pyISiml.jpg) and [Here](http://i.imgur.com/GG2LhVi.jpg)

Main Radiant Spots:  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/nYMIG48.jpg) and [Here](http://i.imgur.com/D38wTUz.jpg)

Good times for this ward:

* (Defensive) You need to establish map control of your own jungle to safely farm it
* (Offensive) You want to setup ganks and know when it's safe to roam through their jungle to do it

**Quick Note on Dewarding**

I'll just quickly say that dewarding is just as much art as it is science.  You need to figure out what kind of support you're dealing with on the other side.  You also need to be able to read enemy movements to determine if they're reacting "funny" to what you're doing.

* Are they very basic in where they place them?
* Do they ward like someone who could have written this guide?

If you can easily deward the enemy, do it.  If you're constantly getting dewarded, immediately get more creative with your ward positioning.  It's better to have SOME vision in less ideal places than no vision because you're constantly dewarded.

**Wrap-Up**

In general, your priorities at different points in the game would be:

* Early Game:  Rune Ward, Mid Ward, Lane Ward
* Mid/Late Game:  Rosh Ward, Objective Ward, Jungle Ward

...

Again, not fully exhaustive of all the reasons/ways you should be warding, but I wanted to at least attempt to give people a more situational philosophy of warding.

Even if you don't fully understand or don't see all the reasons you'd expect for the wards I call out...the main point I'm making here is that your wards shouldn't be used casually or carelessly.  They should be placed with a very specific purpose in mind, as they are a limited asset.

Hopefully this helps someone, or starts a good dialogue.

An analysis of ambulatory patterns in DotA2: do bipedal heroes have an inherent advantage over those that do not use two legs to walk?|self.DotA2|~Hey Everyone,

If any of y'all are like me, then you will no doubt be familiar with that all-too-disturbing feeling of uncertainty on the picking screen.  So many options, who to pick? At times like these, I try to think of what hero might give me the advantage. I recognized that there is a 
noted disparity between two groups of heroes; ones that are bipedals, and ones that are not. This posed the obvious question; do heroes 
that walk on two legs have an advantage over those that walk on four, float, or otherwise do not exhibit bipedalism? So I crunched the 
numbers, and without any further ado, let's take a look at them.

In the below table you will see three groups of heroes compared: 1) Bipedal heroes 2) Non-bipedal heroes and 3) All 108 heroes. It is 
worth noting that non-bipedalism is defined as heroes that do not normally walk on two legs; this includes any heroes that might walk on 
greater than two legs, use arms for assistance, float, flow, or any other instance in which typical bipedalism is not observed. The table 
lists the number of heroes that are bipedal or not out of the total 108, followed by the corresponding range of win percentages, average 
win percentages, and median win percentages for each group. All data was taken from all time statistics on dotabuff.com


Type of Hero | Number of Heroes | Range of Win Percentage | Average Win Percentage | Median Win Percentage 				
---------|----------|----------|---------|---------|				
Bipedal | 64 | 38.82%-56.74% | 48.90% | 49.00% | 				
Non-bipedal | 44 | 41.26%-56.76% | 48.70% | 48.70% 				
All Heroes | 108 | 38.82%-56.76% | 48.84% | 48.97%	


As the data plainly show, **there is no significant difference in average or median win percentage between bipedal and non-bipedal heroes**. 
There is only a 0.2% difference in average win percentage between bipedals and non-bipedals, and a 0.3% difference between median win 
percentages. Thus, when trying to pick between 108 heroes, there is no reason to consider a bipedal or non-bipedal hero preferentially 
over the other.


But what about the most successful heroes in the game? Let's look at the numbers for heroes that have a greater than 50% win rate. Below, 
heroes that win a majority of all games played were examined from each group. There were 42 total heroes that met this criteria, and the 
percentages of bipedal and non-bipedal heroes that made up these 42 were calculated, and compared to their corresponding percentages out 
of all 108 heroes.


Type of Hero | Number of Heroes | Percentage of Heroes with >50% Win-rate | Percentage out of all 108 heroes		
---------|----------|----------|----------|	
Bipedal | 25 | 59.95% | 59.3%		
Non-bipedal | 17 | 40.05% | 40.7%	


Here, it is apparent that **there is no strong correlation between moving on two legs or not, and being a hero that has a greater than 50% 
win rate**. 59.95 percent of heroes that win >50% of games are bipedals, which matches nearly to the 59.3% of all 108 heroes that are 
bipedals. Similarly, 40.5% of the >50% win rate heroes were non-bipedals, which mirrors the 40.7% non-bipedalism seen amongst all heroes.

Overall, I conclude that **there is no significant difference in win rates or overall success of a hero (as determined by having >50% win 
rate) between those that move on two legs, and those that do not**. Therefore, there is no reason to be discouraged by the ambulatory 
patterns of a hero when debating picks. Thank you for reading, and I hope this helps.

TL:DR; It doesn't matter if you pick a hero that walks on two legs, four legs, floats, flows, or scutters, their method of movement should not have an effect on the outcome of your game.~|article

Next Hero EASTER EGG in 7.00? Seems like it!|self.DotA2|~Hey, Reddit.
It's been less than 24 hours since new patch has been released and I already found an easter egg and major chain of links of what the next hero can be.
If you open the "Legend of the Monkey King" comic book (located in /700/monkeyking) to the part where MK gets on trial of "Spirit Brothers", you may see familiar three spirits (Raijin, Kaolin and Xin) and one extra Spirit Brother that we don't know.  Link to that page> http://imgur.com/a/8prSA
The 4th Brother has the same head shape and eyes as Ember Spirit and Earth Spirit have, meaning that it can't be Brewmaster or any existing hero from Dota 2. Also, 4th Brother possess a dark blue, almost indigo colour (Very similar to what Enigma has) and his leg area on the second picture of comic page seems to be the most calm and cloak-like. All in all, this 4th Brother can be Suijin - the God of Water in Japanese mythology. And here's why he can be the next hero:
- If you look on the Arcana of Monkey King, you may find that he basically has been interacting with 4 Elements during his story in a comic book: The first form "Timeless Tale" states that MK was born from a rock (Earth Spirit). Then he finds his iconic weapon inside the seas (Water Spirit). Then he fights Razor inside the Narrow Maze and it seems a bit farfetched but Razor is made of Electricity (Storm Spirit). Finally, MK burns inside the furnace of Ember Spirit. 
So his second Arcana form of "Rumble in the Deep" possess exact the same colour effect of dark blue and indigo as 4th Brother has.
Knowing of how much Valve love to leave us some clues on the next hero in pictures (like Skywrath Mage silhouette on Bristleback patch release) or cosmetics, I think this can be pretty good guess.

An analysis of verbal abuse in DotA2: is it helpful to call your teammate a bitch all game? New research suggests maybe.|self.DotA2|~TL;DR: Research suggests Goldilocks zone of bullying, but doesn't advocate it.

While all of us at some point in our DotA2 histories (and possibly as recently as the last time you played) have experienced some form of verbal abuse, there is little research available as to the effects bullying has on overall game outcomes.  Short term effects of verbal abuse are often limited to post-game reactions, such as reporting the offending player or blocking subsequent communications with them.  **The purpose of this study is to explore and define how verbal abuse of one player affects that players efficiency during the course of the bullying, and also how overall game outcomes (i.e wins and losses) are impacted by this harassment.** Thus, I propose the following two aims:

**Aim 1)** Hypothesis:  A reverse correlation exists between the amount of bullying a player receives, and their in-game performance metrics; such that the more a player is bullied, the worse their overall play will be. To this end, 500 match replays and chat logs will be parsed in which one player is undergoing varying levels of verbal abuse from one teammate.  Changes to gold and experience per minute of the victim over the course of the harassment will be compared to normalized control games.  To determine the ultimate effect on game outcome, wins and losses will be tabulated based on the severity of the abuse and compared between severities and to a no-abuse control group.

**Aim 2)** Using the data generated in Aim 1, our research group will attempt to replicate the results observed from that retrospective analysis in an *in silico* experimental setting.  Thus, over the course of a game, one player will be randomly chosen and harassed throughout at varying levels of severity to confirm the impacts on in-game statistics and outcomes.  Additionally we will test whether or not a piling-on effect, in which multiple teammates criticize the same player, further affects the victim.   We hypothesize there will be an additive effect to the impacts observed in Aim 1 based on increasing harassment load.

To complete Aim 1, as stated above, we collected 500 total replays; 100 each for 5 separate players. For every replay, we counted the instances of verbal abuse that player received in game.  The resulting gold (GPM) and experience (XPM) rates at the end of the abuse matches could then be compared to a control subset of games in which the player was not verbally abused on the same hero.  In the graphs below, all values are normalized to that of a control data set for each player.  In other words, setting GPM and XPM to a value of a 1.0, and then comparing the change to each rate based on the instances of verbal abuse received by that player averaged across their 100 games.  Win rate is also included as a third metric.  

[As seen in the graphs here](http://imgur.com/a/dUDvY), a surprising trend was apparent between all 5 players.  As expected, as the incidents of harassment per game increased, the overall efficiency of a player in game (as measured by GPM and XPM) decreased, with variable gradualness or rapidness based on the player.  Additionally, the corresponding win rates dropped when compared to control games.  Unexpectedly, however, this decrease reached its low point at 7 incidents of harassment.  **Instead of continuing to worsen, the trend reversed itself, as all 5 players metrics increased (again at variable rates) when exposed to 8, 9, and 10+ incidents of harassment per game.**

Of note, comparison of GPM, XPM, and win rate metrics at 7 incidents of harassment to both control levels and 10+ incident levels yielded statistically significant changes (p<0.001).  To explain this surprising trend, we theorize verbally abused players reach a critical point at 7-8 incidents, which we are coining the fuck it point.  Up until and including the seventh incident, play suffers.  However, once that eighth, ninth, and even tenth disparaging comment comes their way, players seem to be driven by a strong desire to prove their bully wrong, which leads to incredible levels of performance exceeding normal play, ultimately resulting in higher than expected win frequencies.  

To complete Aim 2, we sought to confirm the above findings by submitting 10 random players to each level of verbal harassment (1-10), as we believe the trends above seem to suggest a universal pattern in DotA2 players.  To this end, one player was picked in each of the 100 total games and verbally assaulted anywhere from 1 to 10 times.  A non-exhaustive list of insults is compiled in the below table for example.  



Example| Insults| Seen| Here
---|---|----|----
This [abused hero name]| WTF [abused hero name]| Holy shit [abused player color] is bad| Spamming >Well played and pinging the site at which abused player made a questionable play
Fucking [implied negative national/racial/ethnic term] [abused hero name]| Sarcastically noting the poor timing of a purchased item| Useless [abused hero name]| Comment on poor overall score (i.e 0-7 [abused hero name])
We lost because of [abused hero color]| DO SOMETHING [abused hero name]| You a little bitch [abused hero color]| Hey why dont you fucking play better [abused hero name]
Uninstall [abused hero color]| Go back to League [abused hero name]| I think [abused hero color] is just an ape strapped into a chair pounding on a keyboard|  It would be better if [abused hero color] was just an ape strapped into a chair pounding on a keyboard
You got shit on in lane [abused hero name], now were fucked| Nice game [abused hero name, who is not having a nice game], you shit-stain| GG END [abused hero color] SUCKS| jajajajaja [abused hero name]

As expected, our results from this experimental set-up y[ielded very similar data to the above graphs in Aim 1 (first graph here)](http://imgur.com/a/zpDGL).  Indeed, players performance declined when receiving up to 7 instances of harassment, though the players who received 8 or more showed marked improvements to GPM and XPM metrics, which were most improved upon at 10 harassing comments (see aggregate results in first graph here).  We then hypothesized if more two teammates singled out and abused the same player, rates may decline more quickly at lower instances of harassment, but could show even greater improvement at peak levels of abuse.  To test this theory, we repeated our initial experiment described above, but instead of one person doing all the harassing, 2-4 teammates would all harass the same player from 1 to 10 times each (for example; if 2 teammates are testing for 5 negative comments, each player would say 5 negative things, a total of 10 said to the abused player).  

As we anticipated, the addition of extra teammates harassing the abused player decreased their performance in a dose-dependent manner (more abusers = worse metrics).  [However, there was no observed improvement in play with 8 more instances of abuse; indeed there was further decline which was most severe in the most extreme bullying case \(4 teammates piling on the other 1 (last three graphs)](http://imgur.com/a/zpDGL).  It is possible the fuck it point does not apply when more than one person is being critical towards a player.  The abused player may feel overwhelmed when two people are verbally assaulting them, and the same motivation to prove them wrong perhaps is overpowered by self-doubt or anger.  **It is therefore of importance to not assign one player as the team scapegoat.  While venting team frustration at one player may be easy and feel good, it is detrimental to play and likelihood of match success.**

In conclusion, the authors of this seminal study must stress that we do not condone communication abuse in game.  We believe the best case scenario for everyone involved is to not engage in any form of harassment.  However, if you find yourself unable to resist, we strongly suggest that you do so with knowledge of our findings here.  The last thing you want is to only harass that shitty Tusk seven times; youre ruining his play and your chances to win.  If you had just told him to fuck himself one, two, even three more times, that Tusk could have turned your game around and youd find yourself on the winning end of a DotA2 game.  Thank you for reading, and we look forward to your comments.

Not sure if you should buy the Compendium?|self.DotA2|~Are you about to make a post whether or not you should buy a Compendium or you just want a little convincing?

Well the answer is: Yes. Why?

* You're investing and assisting in the growth in eSports. The prize pool started out at $1,600,000 then reached $2,900,000 last year via the Compendium. This year, in 4 days we're currently sitting at near $4,500,000 which is insane. 
* Immortal treasures, which the higher your compendium level is, the more you receive, you will be able to sell on the marketplace and get your small $10 fee back very quickly, even if they're selling for $2 each.
* An insane battle bonus, which assists you in levelling super quickly, resulting in an item every ~~2-3 games. Who knows, you could get lucky with an Arcana drop. 
* You get to vote in the hero who receives the next arcana, and you may either discover your new favourite hero or get lucky with your already favourite hero winning.
* You're contributing to the stretch goals, and at this rate Valve will have to release additional ones. The ones we have reached already are fantastic, and I do not doubt we'll pass $6,000,000 by the end of July.
* Plus you'll get 2 couriers, with alternative skins and a load of other cool stuff. 
* Oh and did I mention that the $6,000,000 goal is base customization? That's right; HATS for your BASE. You love hats, otherwise you wouldn't be playing a Valve game.

You have until the end of July to come up with $10. That's 10 weeks. That's $1 a week. Will you miss that $1 each week? 

Still not sure? How much is a movie? In Australia an adult movie ticket is $17-$20 which lasts on average 90-120 minutes. How long does a match of DotA go for? Average 30minutes. How many games have you played? Exactly.

TL;DR - Yes, go buy one right now and may the DotA gods favour you.

Terrorblade Lore, as analysed by a lit major|self.DotA2|~TL;DR: Terrorblade is the hero equivalent of that awful Papa Roach song. He's really edgy.

Good writing and character design is achieved by the use and occasional subversion of a set of writing conventions. Terrorblade is no exception to this; he's actually one of the better-written of the cast. Certainly better than Tiny, whose entire identity seems to revolve around a series of rock puns.

Terrorblade is constructed around two interrelated themes. In this essay, I shall address each separately, highlighting how these themes manifest in his biography, voice responses, visuals, and ability effects, and then I shall link them together and explain how they work in tandem to create the character of Terrorblade. I am doing this in spite of having five major essays due in the next two weeks. Please send help.

The first of the two themes evident throughout Terrorblade's characterisation is that of mirrors. This theme is endemic in all illusion-based heroes, with the exception of Spectre and Chaos Knight; Terrorblade, however, takes this theme a step further than them. Whereas the idea of mirrors is a secondary theme in someone like Morphling, whose primary character focus is on (unsurprisingly) shapeshifting, morphing, and deception, Terrorblade uses mirrors as his primary thematic motif. Sentenced to Foulfell, Terrorblade was forced to "gaze eternally into the twisted reflection of their [sic] own soul". Foulfell has appeared before this; Wraith Night had Foulfell Shards, which appeared graphically as mirror fragments, thus leading to the popular depiction of Foulfell as a fractal, demonic mirror dimension. Terrorblade also "ruled in the hell of Foulfell" and "made himself master of his own reflected worst self". Clearly, mirrors play an important part in his backstory, and his powers demonstrated in-game stem from the manipulation of reflections and mirrors. Reflection forces enemies to gaze into their own worst selves; Conjure Image summons a fractal, fragmented and imperfect mirror self of Terrorblade; and Metamorphosis shows him metaphorically shattering the mirror entirely and assuming his full, terrible power (as per the description of his arcana). Sunder is the least thematically relevant of all his abilities, and will have its own mention later on in this work in relation to secondary themes.

Visually, Terrorblade also utilises this mirror theme, especially with the arcana. Aside from the obvious Reflection and Conjure Image, Terrorblade's physical form is composed of jagged plates that reflect light (with shadows turned on in game settings, and the arcana equipped). His armour appears to be at least partially *made* of some mirror-like substance - what is under that armour, or if that armour is actually his body, is unknown. Furthermore, his arcana provides a custom death animation for those he kills, which from a distance mimics someone puckering up into their own asshole. However, when examined more closely, the animation shows the victim shattering, much akin to a mirror, and their life essence being consumed by Terrorblade (see secondary themes). Although this effect is reliant on the arcana, it serves to highlight the visual nature of Terrorblade's primary thematic elements alongside that of his abilities.

The second primary theme Terrorblade possesses works with the first to generate interest in the character. This theme is "fear", and is equally as obvious as mirrors are - it is quite literally a part of his name. The purpose of Foulfell's punishment is obviously intended to elicit a reaction of terror and denial of their worst selves from its inmates; Terrorblade's shattering of its fractal walls is symbolic of his assuming complete power over fear, something he quite obviously delights in. His voice lines make this evident - "fear what you will never understand", "quiver and quail", "the wise flee my footfalls", "fear comes for you", "they cannot hide". I could go on, but I believe the point has been made.

Yet this is somewhat ironic, as Terrorblade's punishment still lingers within him as his metamorphosed form - his power over fear comes from his *being* afraid of himself, and the intimate knowledge this terror brings him. One of his lines for using Metamorphosis is "Ahm'sol miskath ozh", a line in Ozkavosh that translates to "All hope fails me." Terrorblade and Metamorphosis Terrorblade are two distinct personalities - the Meta Terrorblade is decidedly more violent, cruel, and downright evil, delighting in his monstrous power (Eyik ozh poz!) whereas Terrorblade is more prideful and underhanded, and with more emphasis on mischief and rogue-like behaviour as opposed to brute force carnage (My aggrandizement increases!).

His abilities, as with the theme of mirrors, serve to act as vessels to convey the theme of fear. Reflection, by creating a 'worst self' of enemies, incites and spreads the same fear that Terrorblade himself feels. Although I freely admit this next point is a stretch, the split-pushing capabilities of Terrorblade can also be seen as a thematic application of his work to "turn his terror loose upon all creation".

These two themes work together; the mirror is the source of Terrorblade's power, and fear is the manifestation of that power. The blending of these themes is most apparent in Metamorphosis; as I explained, Terrorblade fears his worst self reflected back at him, but that fear grants him power over the fear of others. His fear of his own self, although not explicitly stated, is the primary character drive for Terrorblade; he is as much a victim of himself as he is the perpetrator. Others being susceptible to fear grants him power; hence his rivalry with Timbersaw, who as the leafy lumberjack Batman is somewhat immune to the terror Terrorblade inflicts.

The character also has a couple of secondary themes. The first of these is thieving; Terrorblade was imprisoned for his thievery, and upon breaking out of Foulfell retained his status as a "cosmic iconoclast". Sunder is the primary manifestation of this theme, stealing the enemy's life force; his arcana kill animation also shows him stealing the life force from his slain foes. This is relegated to a secondary motif as it is not as endemic in his design; Terrorblade as a thief is a remnant of his pre-Foulfell self that he clings to in order to differentiate himself from the brutal sadism of Meta Terrorblade. The second of these lesser themes is rage, or wrath; this motif manifests itself in Metamorphosis, where "the rage rises up and takes control". Terrorblade also references his rage in his responses - "all anger ends in cruelty", "the hunter demon rages". Rage is a character trait of Meta Terrorblade that is used as a weapon of terror.

Despite the copious edgelord appearance, the character of Terrorblade is considerably deeper than first appearances dictate. I've not covered every aspect of his personality and interactions; such an effort would take far more time than I have already. Nevertheless, analysis of motifs can be applied to any hero in the game to reveal the construction of their character.~|article

The Art of Drafting|self.DotA2|~Drafting has always been an integral part in competitive Dota 2 matches. A Dota 2 match doesnt start when the horn blows, neither does it start when 10 heroes spawn in both fountains. It starts at the drafting page where either captain tries to outsmart the other. 30 seconds per ban/pick and 130 seconds of reserve time is all each team gets to decide the 5 heroes they want to play and removing 5 from their opponents pool. It might seem like a lot of time but for those that have experience drafting, somehow these seconds slipped by faster than one would hope for.
The art of drafting is something far more complex than any human mind can comprehend and even the best minds in the world such as Kuroky, Puppey or PPD can get out-drafted by others. There are probably tens or hundreds of thoughts going through the captains mind at each point in the draft - What if they pick X hero? Are we ready for it?; Should I ban X or Y hero?; Should I deny pick them or stick with what we are comfortable?; Will they cheese us?; the list goes on. Breaking down all these thought processes will be impossible due to its endless possibilities. Instead, let us look at the different approaches teams tend to undertake when drafting.

**Proactive vs Reactive**

Teams can either be proactive or reactive when drafting. Being proactive means that you go into the draft with a strategy or a specific playstyle in mind, picking heroes that suit your strategy, with your opponent picks having minimal impact on your draft. On the contrary, being reactive simply means to react to whatever your opponent picks and counter them. Of course, both approaches have its pros and cons and there are no right or wrong in either approach. Imagine a scale from 1-100 (with 1 being 100% proactive and 100 being 100% reactive), it depends entirely on the team (or captain) which point on the scale they (or he) would like to be on.

A good example of a proactive team would be the current iteration of NaVi. They tend to go for their comfort picks (i.e. Sonneikos Disruptor, Rodgers Enchantress, Crystallizes Faceless Void, Dendis Lina, Generals Clockwork), playing the game in their comfort zone and forcing their opponents to play at their tempo. Pros? A familiar lineup that allows everyone on the team to be on the same page. This is probably a huge factor in NaVi finding early success at the start of the season, qualifying for both the StarLadder and PGL minors. The downside? They can be quite predictable and easily countered.

This is why the best captains in the world are able to balance this scale, knowing exactly when to be proactive or reactive. Theres no better example than Liquid.Kuroky at TI7. In the Lower Bracket series against LGD, Kuroky expected the Chinese to go for the Magnus for eLeVeN in game 1. As such, he was ready for it and reacted accordingly, resulting in a massive out-draft. Kuroky immediately switched things up in game 2, taking a more proactive approach. He went for the Dazzle-Huskar duo as well as Broodmother and forced LGD to have an answer for it.

There are scenarios where a certain team understands the meta better than everyone else. As such, they are able to be more proactive in their approach and this forces their opponents to react. The best example here would be CDEC during TI5. They drafted and played their own style of Dota and none of the teams had an answer up until the Grand Finals where EG.ppd had them figured out. However, in the current meta where lane matchups are extremely important, the drafting meta is naturally leaning towards the reactive scale. With that said, let us look at the different phases of drafting and the various ways of approaching them.

**1st phase bans**

*Proactive* - Removing the strongest heroes in the meta (i.e. Batrider back in the days, Troll / Sniper during 6.83 and Leshrac during TI5). As for the current meta, heroes such as Nightstalker, Lich, Natures Prophet, Venomancer and Necrophos are all contenders.

*Reactive* - Targeting specific comfort heroes of your opponent. However, such an approach usually gives the draft advantage to the team being targeted. Back at TI3, teams were banning Admiral Bulldogs Natures Prophet and Lone Druid in the 1st phase, forcing him to play a hero that he is less comfortable on. However, this allowed Alliance to get their hands on Io and Naga Siren. Similarly at TI7, teams were targeting GHs Io and Keeper of the Light and this opened up more options for Kuroky in his drafts.

**1st phase picks**

*Proactive* - Drafting a specific strategy. A good example would be picking up Faceless Void + Ancient Apparition right away. It forms a good skeleton to your draft yet at the same time, gives away your game plan. (Note: This approach is more common if the team has 2nd pick.)

*Reactive* - Consist of the stronger meta heroes that leaked through the ban phase. As mentioned earlier, having favorable lane matchups is extremely important in todays meta as it allows supports to constantly move around the map. As such, teams will avoid picking their cores early so as to prevent getting counter-picked. This is why it is rather common to see all four supports being picked in the 1st phase. Another important thing is keeping an open draft. This is the reason why Earthshaker is one of the top 1st pick hero currently. Not only is he one of the strongest position 4 hero in the meta, he is also extremely versatile and can be played on multiple roles (2, 3, 4, 5). Having such a hero early on in the draft allows a team to switch things up should the need arise. This was a technique that EG.Cr1t used quite frequently back when he was still drafting for the boys in blue. He would pick core heroes like Puck or Batrider early on in the draft and switch roles if he feels that it has been heavily countered.

**2nd phase bans**

*Proactive* - Removing heroes that counter your lineup. Here are 3 different scenarios, each with an example. 1) Lane counters: Banning Weaver / Lifestealer when you have an offlane Batrider. 2) Hero counters: Banning Silencer when you have an Enigma. 3) Strategy counters: Banning Anti-Mage / Morphling when you have a strong wombo-combo lineup that is weak against split-push. The approach to these bans is considered proactive as it is centered around your own draft.

*Reactive* - Firstly, you can opt to ban heroes from a certain role which your opponent lacks. For example, if your opponent did not pick their position 4 support in the 1st phase, you can focus your 2nd phase bans on heroes such as Sand King and Nyx Assassin to further reduce their options. Another alternative would be to focus your bans on heroes that synergizes extremely well with your opponents 1st phase picks (i.e. banning away Silencer when your opponent has Batrider or Legion Commander). Also, if your opponent drafted heroes like Natures Prophet + Shadow Shaman in the 1st phase, the first thing that comes to mind is a possibility for a deathball push. As such, banning heroes like Pugna, Dragon Knight or Drow Ranger in the 2nd phase could be an option.

**2nd phase picks**

The 2nd phase is where it gets interesting. As mentioned, teams will try to avoid showing their cores unless they already know what they are up against (i.e. picking a carry upon knowing your opponents offlane, vice versa). As such, depending on how the draft unfolds, one team will be forced to show a core hero first. This is also why heroes such as Venomancer and Necrophos are so popular now. They are versatile cores that can be played on multiple roles / lanes and they are extremely strong and self-sustained laners which is really important in the current meta. Despite showing your core early on, the versatility of these heroes doesnt fully expose your game plan and will keep your opponents guessing.

*Proactive* - Picking heroes that synergizes with your lineup / strategy (i.e. Picking Visage / Weaver into a Drow Strat) or simply picking strong hero duos such as Dazzle-Huskar or Oracle-Death Prophet.

*Reactive* - This is similar to the proactive section of the 2nd phase bans. Instead of one team banning proactively, this would be the other team picking reactively. Here are more examples with the same 3 scenarios: 1) Lane Counter: Picking Oracle into Dark Seer. 2) Hero Counter: Picking Razor into Lifestealer. 3) Strategy Counter: Lets take a trip down memory lane back to TI2 where Puppey was able to draft the perfect counter to the strongest combo back then - Naga Sleep into Dark Seer Vacuum combo. Luminous: Puppey talked about the Naga Counter, its LightofHeaven with his BKB. (Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDaJes0T1Ig) to re-live the moment) (Disclaimer: the YouTube video does not belong to me. Credits to the owner of the video.)

**Final ban**

Most of the time (with few exceptions), teams should already know the missing role in the opponents draft. As such, the last ban would be solely to target the hero of that specific role/player. For example, if it is obvious that the opponent lacks a mid hero, the last ban can be one that counters your mid hero (i.e. Silencer against Puck) or simply just a classic hero of the player in question (i.e. Scccs Queen of Pain). Also, the last ban could be used to remove a hero that would complete your opponents lineup (i.e. Banning Medusa into a Drow lineup).

**Final pick**

The last pick is usually something that would complete your own draft (proactive) or counter the enemys draft (reactive). It is important to find the balance between having a favorable lane matchup and fitting the hero into your overall game plan. For example, NaVi likes to last pick Lina into Faceless Void. Not only is Lina one of Dendis best hero, it also synergizes well with FV. Another possible approach would be to spot a weakness in your opponents draft and pick a hero that exploits that weakness. For example, picking Broodmother into a lineup that is lacking AOE or a slippery hero like Morphling into a lineup that lacks lockdown. This is usually more effective when you have the ultimate last pick as your opponent is unable to counter that pick.

**Conclusion**

Some captains favor being proactive while others prefer reactive. However, it is never a good thing to be too extreme on either ends. What separates the excellent drafters from the good ones is the ability to balance between strategy and counter-picking, knowing exactly when to be proactive and when to be reactive even within a single draft itself. Getting a good draft going into the game increases the confidence of the team. I personally believe that the best Dota is played when a team is fearless yet collected; where players feel comfortable making plays in their own capacity while still following the game plan as dictated by the captain.

Drafting is not easy. In fact, it is insanely difficult. The level of intricacy going into every pick and ban is enormous. What I have presented here is a simplified way to look at drafting and hopefully upon reading, it will help you better understand the drafting phase when watching a competitive game in the future.

This is why Chinese Dota is dead|self.DotA2|~SanSheng A.K.A. Dog Bro, was too poor to even afford to buy a case of cigarettes. He could only spend 1 RMB (about 15 cents) to buy some bulk ones. People always teased him as "rubbish dog".

Now when he's streaming, the audiences always try to persuade him not to smoke that much. " Hey Dog bro stop smoking so much, you'd get cancer for that!". He'd say "Whatever. I'm hopeless on smoking." and then keep lighting another cigarette about every 15 minutes.



He said when sleeping by the road with Zippo, he boasted that "I'm gonna smoke Zhonghua(one of the best cigarettes in China) everyday when I get rich". Zippo said "Fuck you rubbish dog, we can only pick the cigarette butts. How the fuck can we have Zhonghua?" Sansheng smiled and said " At least let me have a thought about it."

Right before the finals of TI4, Sansheng smoked half of the cigarette and securities let him put it out, telling him that ESPN is live casting and no smoking is allowed. He didn't say anything, just forcefully smoked twice and finished the other half of the cigar. Hao asked him "why insist on that one cigar? We'll at least be the runner up, let's get some best cigars when we get back home." Sansheng responded "I'm reluctant to waste it. Years ago I spent 0.5 rmb just to buy 2 bulk Jiaozi(a brand of relatively quite cheap cigarettes), and now I'm having the nice American cigars. I may not be able to smoke it tomorrow."

When Sansheng was talking about this in his stream, you can hear his voice trembling.
"Fuck..." Dog bro said, then lighted another cigarette.



"While we were sleeping on the streets, all we wanted is to feed ourselves, and to be able to continue playing the game. Win honor for our country? I'm afraid I didn't think that far. All we wanted is to win. We win, we can pay our meals, that's all. My first official match was in Chongqing, we carried our quilts with us when we were going there. We planned to sleep in the net cafe, but we arrived too late, and didn't know the exact address of the net cafe, so we could only sleep on the street. It was raining, we had no choice to hide on the porches.  The next day when I got up, I found the quilt already soaking wet."

"At that time I was thinking, if I can ever get some prizes and get rich someday, I'll buy a house for my mom, and a car for my sister."

After winning TI4, someone asked Sansheng why he didn't look at the camera when people were taking pictures of them. He laughed and said, "the trophy is so dazzling that I can't even open my eyes." Mu, who's just besides him, was already choking with sobs.


In the year of 2014, 25 year old Wang "Sansheng" Zhaohui with team Newbee got the championships of the International 4.

 

During Nanyang Championships, interviewers asked "the chosen one" Maybe, "Meepo is a very hot pick recently outside China, w33 is also an outstanding meepo player. Will you consider practicing this hero too?"

Maybe: "No."

At the same time.
Kaka: Are we playing RPG tonight??? It's emergent!!!

An analysis of UI and map changes in Patch 7.00: how players ocular inefficiencies led to increased pick rates of heroes with more than two eyes|self.DotA2|~**TL:DR:** To compensate for their inabilities to adjust to UI and map changes in patch 7.00, players picked heroes with more-than-two-eyes more in the week following patch 7.00 release than the patch/week prior.

Hello everyone,

Over the course of my career as a DotA2 analyst, the cornerstone of my research has focused on why we pick our heroes.  Rather than go into well-established dogma as to the effectiveness of each hero patch-to-patch, or the esoteric arguments of situational need, my studies seek to explore a largely unaccounted for niche.  That is, *subconsciously*, what factors influence our hero selections?  Ive looked at hero attractiveness, hero personalities, hero teeth, genetically modified heroes, and all things in between.  Some have argued that this past research has little relevance, isnt practical, or is simply a waste of timeall points I soundly disagree with.  Be that as it may, the recent overhaul to DotA2 via patch 7.00 presents a wonderful opportunity to, perhaps, break bread with some of my critics. 

Patch 7.00 fundamentally changed DotA2, and if the response on community outlets such as this subreddit are any indication, players were not prepared for that much change.  While there were many large modifications, it is fair to say two stuck out by knocking players out of their comfort zones: user interface (UI) and map changes.  Ultimately, change to these once set-in-stone features, disoriented and confused many players.  Glancing around the screen for common indicators of a games progression, such as creep score, health bars, hero levels, and enemy inventories quickly became an uncomfortable task.  Many players complained of increased eye-movement necessary to glean all of this information, some of which they argued was now absent.  The updated map also warranted intensified scrutiny of the screennew paths, structures, Roshan location, and juke spots all needed to be ocularly assessed and filed away into memory.  Taken together, players eyes were under some serious strain, which begs the question: did this affect how we picked our heroes?

Consciously, we were aware that our two eyes were simply not getting the job done when it came to interpreting the new UI and map.  Also consciously, many complained to Valve.  However, subconsciously, **I hypothesize that players attempted to compensate for the inability of their eyes to take in these changes by picking heroes with more-than-two-eyes**.  Therefore, I propose that the pick rates of heroes with more-than-two-eyes will be increased in the week following patch 7.00s release.

For this pilot study, I first needed to establish a baseline of what a hero with more-than-two-eyes is.  To that end, only heroes with more-than-two-eyes present as they spawn into the game were considered.  This includes heroes that have more-than-two-eyes on their faces (Sandking), those with two heads attached to the same body (Ogre Magi), those comprised of multiple individuals (Techies), or those with mounts (two eyes for the rider, two eyes for the mount).   Excluded heroes for the purposes of this study include illusion generating (Phantom Lancer) and minion creating heroes (Beastmaster), as primary concern was on eyes present at the start of the match.  

To test my hypothesis, hero pick rate data was collected from dotabuff.com for the week following patch 7.00 release, as well as the week before using an internet archive tool. **An important note**: patch 7.00 pick rate data excludes Monkey King in order to fairly compare the remaining heroes.  Monkey Kings pick rate was obviously high due to his release, and I did not want that data affecting the rest of the heroes. In table 1 below, heroes that meet the above presented more-than-two-eye criteria are listed along with their pick rates for each week.  The difference between patch 7.00 and pre-patch are shown in the bottom row.  



Hero| Mirana| Luna| Ogre Magi| Alchemist| Sand King| Chaos Knight| Jakiro| Techies| Disruptor| KotL| Batrider| Broodmother
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
Type of eyes| Mount| Mount| Two heads| Mount/Two bodies| Many eyes| Mount| Two heads| Two bodies| Mount| Mount| Mount| Many eyes
Patch 7.00 pick rate| 20.89| 13.74| 11.75| 10.77| 8.94| 6.77| 5.39| 5.21| 5.09| 4.51| 3.24| 2.20
Pre-patch 7.00 pick rate| 20.09| 11.26| 10.96| 11.58| 8.55| 5.29| 4.75| 4.25| 5.51| 4.80| 2.96| 2.11
Difference| 0.80| 2.48| 0.79|-0.80 |0.39 |1.48 | 0.64|  0.96| -0.42| -0.29| 0.28| 0.09

As seen above, 9/12 more-than-two-eye heroes demonstrated increased pick rates the week after 7.00s release, providing strong evidence for an upward trend in more-than-two-eye hero pick rates.  Only 3 did not follow this trend, Alchemist, Disruptor, and Keeper of the Light.  These may be explained by players reluctance to pick elderly heroes likely having poor eyesight (Alchemist and KotL), and awareness that an eyepatch could obstruct vision (Disruptor).  

Statistically, I chose to test this phenomenon by calculating a Z score for the two population proportions. Table 2 below displays the total number of heroes with more-than-two-eyes picked in each week, and also the sum of all heroes picked each week (again, Monkey King not included for 7.00).  For 7.00, there is a slight increase in both categories, likely attributed to popularity of the new patch.  Overall when comparing the proportions of more-than-two-eye heroes played in each week, there is a significant increase in pick rates after patch 7.00.



Table 2| Patch 7.00| Pre-patch 7.00
---|---|----
More-than-two-eye hero picks| 6,992,239| 6,471,613
Sum of all hero picks| 70,976,730| 70,264,342
Proportion| 0.099| 0.092
Z Score| 129.7185| 
P value| <0.00001| Significant

Finally, as a proof of principle, the pick rates for a hero without any eyes, Faceless Void, were studied.  If players were subconsciously picking heroes with more-than-two-eyes to help understand changes to the map and UI, then they should also avoid a hero that, at best, offers no additional help, and at worse, is a detriment (blindness).  Table 3s data supports this hypothesis, as the pick rate for Faceless Void fell by a staggering 2% in the week of patch 7.00.



Table 3| Patch 7.00| Pre-patch 7.00| Difference
---|---|----|----
Faceless Void Pick Rate| 10.5| 12.53| -2.03

In summary, this study is the first to date to show how real updates and changes to a game (in the form of patch 7.00) can subconsciously affect how players choose their heroes.  **Statistically, in the week following the release of patch 7.00, heroes with more-than-two-eyes were picked at a higher rate than the previous week and patch.**  This suggests an effort by players to compensate for their inability to grasp changes to the UI and map by getting additional sets of eyeballs to help out.  Future work should focus on elements excluded from this study (illusions, minions), as well as following the data out over the next few weeks to see if more-than-two-eye hero pick rates fall as players become accustomed to the new patch.  

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to your comments.

The 2012 Na'vi Squad.|self.DotA2|~The DotA Chronicles, Page two.

Previous Page: https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6zp6b9/the_burning_antimage/

The 2012 Na'vi Squad and how they defined Esports.

"Natus Vincere: Can you feel it?"

When people talk about the great DotA teams of all time; they remember the perfect farming of the 2010 EHOME squad. The split push style of the 2013 Alliance team. The gems of players, adorning the already golden crown of team DK in 2014, the genius drafts of EG in 2015. But the team that gave me, personally the most excitement, and the most memories, was the 2012 Na'vi Squad.

1. XBOCT
2. Dendi
3. LightOfHeaven
4. Smile
5. Puppey

TI2 was when for me, Na'vi truly won the favor of the community, winning hearts, but not the tournament. But first, a bit of background. Natus Vincere were the winners of the inaugural International in 2011, only dropping a single game against EHOME in the final, taking it 3-1 in the Best of five thanks to a winner bracket advantage. After TI, Artstyle resigned from Na'vi, citing his lack of will to give over his TI winnings to the organisation and left Na'vi under a cloud sadly. Despite the issues, Puppey was made captain, and Ars-Art was recruited into the side. Na'vi won ESWC against the old enemy EHOME again, then went on to win the inaugural Defense against Quantic. Despite Artstyle's departure, Na'vi kept on steamrolling the opposition, and came into TI2 on a high. TI2 marked the first international at the famous Benaroya Hall in Seattle, which would become the stage for TI3 too before the eventual move to KeyArena.

Natus Vincere came in not as favourites however, despite the build up to the tournament. The general consensus was that the Chinese teams would reign supreme, LGD, DK and iG were the 3 big teams from China coming into TI, and the pre-tournament predictions seemed to hold true. Na'vi had a terrible day 1, Losing 2-0 to iG, only tying with coL and EHOME, before a 2-0 loss to Orange ended their day one with a 2-6 score, looking destined for the lower bracket. However, not for the first time, the Na'vi squad would turn around what looked
like a lost situation. A 2-0 win in the grudge match versus the Artstyle-Captained Darer squad, and a crushing of MTW put Na'vi at 6-6, needing a 2-0 against Hao and Mu's TongFu in the final set of games for the day. In the first game, this team created their first, truly memorable moment in the international. Everything was fine before the match, until they let TongFu pick Naga Siren. Naga Siren at the time, was considered the most overpowered hero in the game by many in Benaroya and many watching at home. The Song of the Siren having no castpoint was genuinely, absolutely broken. Mixed in with an enormous rip tide AOE, and illusions not doing limited tower damage, the hero was considered the best in the game, by a stretch. Na'vi however, picked a draft with PA and Puck, looking to win the game before the Naga could come online, and boss the entire game. After an even start to the match, Na'vi went in for Roshan without vision on TongFu. The sleep came out as Roshan was down to half life, with the entire of Natus Vincere trapped in the pit, it looked hopeless for the CIS Squad.

"Puppey will have to turn around for the biggest black hole of his life."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a16Wdkic3Q TongFu v Navi

And he did. A vacuum into a four man wall, and the black hole on top destroyed TongFu, and led to a five man wipe. It was sensational. It was unbelievable. It was Na'vi, and they had punched their ticket to the upper bracket.

Na'vi would play the legendary DK Squad, with rOtk and burNIng on it in the first game of the upper bracket. A poor laning decision by DK to go aggressive tri-lane in an attempt to keep XBOCT's Anti-Mage down led to the downfall of the DK squad in 25 minutes. In game two however, the DK lineup changed to the securing of burNIng's farm, his Morphling owning the game, alongside LongDD's Nature's Prophet, and Na'vi couldn't get the win quick enough, leading to DK winning late and taking the second game. As the game 3 draft came up,
and as the three bans came out from Na'vi and DK, there was no Naga. DK instantly locked her in. Naga had only been given away on the main stage once previously, by Zenith to coL, and TC's Naga Siren easily split pushed, and outfought the lineup of Zenith to win the game. Na'vi however, had experience of defeating the Naga in the groups against Darer and TongFu, but this was DK. DK raced into a lead, going agressive into the Natus Vincere jungle, to kill Puppey and LightOfHeaven as the sound of the horn echoed in the hall.
A Puppey signature jungle Lycan, and the hero of the International, Dendi on Rubick, Na'vi did have a comfortable lineup, but could they beat the DK.BurNIng Naga? It looked good. The boys from CIS took an early lead, before going on rOtk's offlane enigma top. They pounced on him, and with less than 50 health, he caught both Dendi and XBOCT in a black hole and took down both of them, leading to a Tier one tower being brought down, always a good thing against the Anti-Mage lineup of Na'vi. Puppey did sneak a Roshan, but
DK rotated to bring down the final tier one of Natus Vincere at the 14 minute mark. Small trades ensued, with BurNIng and XBOCT getting their farm up, until the game went quiet, both teams feeling comfortable to clear out the map and push out lanes. DK and BurNIng looked powerful, the Naga being massive with a Radiance and Heart in tow at 24 minutes, but somehow, Na'vi saw this as their own timing. With a Lycan aegis, they knocked down the DK tier 3 before there was a response. Until burNIng popped the Song of the Siren,
looking for the 3-4 Man Black hole, which would end this Na'vi resurgence. But something, was wrong. There was no grouping, there was no good hole, Na'vi were spread out perfectly, not caught by the song whatsoever. With the song down, Na'vi went for it, and with what felt like endless sustain, DK did all they could to hold their base, but as the word "Rampage!" filled the cheering hall of fans, it was over in a flash.

They would now face iG, after their defeat of EG in the winners bracket Semi final, and so began possibly the most famous series in the history of DotA. The crowd's cheers echoed as Na'vi walked onto the stage, arms aloft, cheering on the fan-favourites. But they came out of the booths quicker than anyone could have expected. iG, in a masterclass, destroyed the defending champions, with all tier 2 towers ripped apart by Zhou's Morphling by the 16 Minute mark, and with the score at 6-0, Na'vi called it. Were iG really that
good? They had just shredded the champions, in the only flawless game of the tournament. Na'vi needed something special, something miraculous to halt the steam train which was Invictus Gaming in game two.

"Oh, Oh, Oh No! Oh god... This could be painful."

Invictus Gaming got Naga and Darkseer. A combo never given away during the entire of the International until that point. A combination that at the time, meant Darkseer could vaccum people in - while they slept - to unleash a brutal combination. LD was right, this really could be painful. However, Na'vi looked like they had a plan, with the third pick of Juggernaut, a rarely seen hero at the time, alongside the staples of the Dendi Rubick, and crucially, the LightOfHeaven Enigma. The game looked like it started well for Na'vi, but the Naga was farming, and the towers weren't falling with a draft including Enchantress and Juggernaut.
The game was far too quiet for the liking of Na'vi, and after iG dived the Natus Vincere tier one tower to kill Dendi and Ars-Art, but as the Ravage and the Song were used, they came right back at iG, bringing down Ferrari and Zhou in the shadow of the tier two mid of iG. The game went back to being quiet, iG farming and getting their levels to complete the Ravage, Wall, Song combo. Na'vi took down towers while iG avoided the fights. As Na'vi set up to take the final outer tower of iG, they smoked up as five. Sneaking through the river, creeping behind the Natus Vincere lineup. YYF Surges Zhou into battle with his Song of
the Siren online, putting the entire of Na'vi under the spell of the Siren. The Darkseer pulled them into the centre of the fight into the dirt path, a place which would make a fitting grave for what looked like the entire of Na'vi. The ravage came out, but LightOfHeaven hit his Black King Bar in time, and performed a miracle. Catching four of iG in the hole, with the spinning Juggernaut on top, with Dendi's ravage, stolen from Faith's Tidehunter to finish off Invictus Gaming, wiping them off the map.

'The Play' had happened before our eyes. Not a play. The play had happened, a play that would come to define the competitive scene of DotA 2. The madness of it all. How anything can happen, how teams battling for millions to change their lives can come down to miraculous plays, and heart-wrenching mistakes. How players are created by their choices when they sit down to play the game. How nothing else matters when you're in it. Winners and Losers, The Haves and Have-nots, the players who will lift the aegis, and the
players who will have their heartstrings torn to shreds. From the managers, to the fans, to the players, everyone can feel every little bit of emotion in the game, and this is why I love DotA.

Na'vi would go on to take the game two and three, and defeat the undefeated LGD team to reach the Grand Final, but fell to the vengance-driven Invictus Gaming in the final 3-1 after an epic series. They may not have won the tournament. But the won the hearts of the people watching worldwide. Everybody knows the play, in all types of videogames, anyone who has watched Esports for a long time, they'll tell you what the play was. A play to define DotA. A moment to define Esports.

[META] Leaked documents reveal high profile community members send upvotes to off-shore accounts to avoid downvotes: The Peruvian Papers.|self.DotA2|~TL;DR: Rich people avoid downvotes by paying off people over-seas to do it for them. They probably laugh about it behind all your backs, too.

This special report strays from usual topics of analysis, but we believe this is something the /r/DotA2 community should be aware of.  An anonymous user closely involved with the inner-workings of this sub-reddit recently leaked a trove of data on user karma scores to myself and members of my analysis team.  This leak reveals rampant use of off-shore karma accounts linked to high profile members of the DotA2 community.  To protect their anonymity, our sources name has been altered, and they will be referred to only as Dannie K..  This report is the first installment of a large-scale investigation which we are terming the Peruvian Papers.
 
Nearly all of us are familiar with the karmic aspect of Reddit karma.  Some of your posts and comments get upvoted, some get ignored, and some are downvoted.  After burying our team under thousands of pages of karma reports, Dannie K. gave us only one clue:[ look into CIS users who use Christmas Pudge flairs \(aka Santa Pudge\)](https://imgur.com/4esHYTM.png).  This clue would ultimately expose a hidden world of karma-rich users who use off-shore karma safe-havens to avoid downvotes.  

We began pouring through the leaked files and indeed found a pattern of Pudge-Santa flaired users from the CIS region who had earned consistent negative karma scores.  Given that exclusively negative karma scores break the previously mentioned karmic balance, we sifted through the data to find an explanation for these imbalanced accounts.  What we found shocked us, and will force many to reconsider the notion of a perceived fairness in the Reddit voting system.  
 
Large chunks of positive karma were being sent to these CIS Santa-Pudges from off-shore accounts.  These boluses of upvotes remain hidden from users overall karma scores, but were found in the sub-reddit meta data.  Tracing the origins of these deposits revealed that they were coming from users with unnatural patterns of posts/comments that are consistently highly upvoted.  Current and former community members such as Nahaz, SirActionSlacks, Blitz, ESPORTSREP, and others were found to have wired positive karma to the Santa-Pudges shell-accounts.  
 
What this boils down to is a mutual agreement between two groups trying to avoid karmic imbalance.  High-profile community members whose posts are highly (and unnaturally) upvoted need a source of negative karma for balance.  Thus, Nahaz and others use offshore CIS region accounts (Santa-Pudge flairs) to receive a source of negative karma by sending excess positive karma overseas.   In turn, Santa-Pudges simply post whatever moronic drivel comes to mind, and collect downvotes in proxy for their well-to-do clients.  [See this chart for visual representation.](https://imgur.com/GeunkCh.png) 

We sincerely thank Dannie K. for providing this data, and note the bravery and moral fortitude they showed in doing so.  We hope the community recognizes the good this kind of whistle-blowing does, and look forward to discussions generated by these findings.  Thank you for reading.

Improving game play: Reporting cheaters in Dota 2|self.DotA2|~As you can see, more and more players are **cheating** in Dota2. This can be very frustrating to players because of imbalanced gameplay where one player can do the impossible. This is because cheaters are playing with illegal **scripts** and **hacks**(Yes you read it right, hacks). These hacks are changing/adding game files called **.lua** files which normally cannot be modified by a legitimate player. Some modifications with the config **.cfg** files are already giving unfair advantage too but that is not our focus this time.  
I know that a lot of players already know what the cheat is called but I would rather not mention it here since *innocent players* might develop interest into using cheats which is totally not fun.  
  
  
Some of the most popular and very impactful cheats in game are:  
  
 * Techies can automatically detonate the amount of needed bombs anywhere in the map when a hero is in effect range.  
 * Phantom assassin(because he is the most popular with it) and other heroes with critical ability can hit critical damage all the time by cancelling the attack animation until it is certain that the attack  will deal critical damage. This is done by listening to audio files. This is not humanly possible(Excuse me, I have tried to do it and did manage to hit all critical srikes, note that if you do so you will lose focus on many other aspects of the game. On the other hand, their cheat is faster than what a human can do, and will automatically follow the target if it is running while the cheater is trying to crit).  
 * Automatically disable, euls, hex, stun enemies, that become suddenly visible to you which prevents potential kills(when they blink or suddenly break from invisibility). This may include automatically killing heroes in death range together with other cheats.  
 * Automatically do combos of many different heroes including complex ones, can be either abilities only, items only, or mix of both and may be done in order or without any sequence. Popular ones are lina euls combo and meepo combos, axe combo, kunkka combo, necrophos combo, unfair brewmaster controlled by script. This may also include orb walking, stacking, controlling multiple units(macroing) favorable to chen and enchantress cheaters to do certain things.  
 * Armlet toggling with no error. You will be only killed when it is impossible to survive.  
 * Rubick automatically steal spells of choice like ravage, blackhole etc.  
 * Vision cheat, map range cheat, displaying enemy wards, displaying enemy courier's location.  
 * Anti-smoke of deceit, anti-gank, show if you can be seen by the opponents. May also display invisible units/heroes like riki and clinkz.  
 * Display opponent's items, skills, mana, and cooldown.  
 * Differentiate enemy hero from illusion.  
 * Show roshan timer, show runes, show creep spawn boxes, show next screep spawn(both lane and jungle).  
 * Automatically juke, escape, and chase; preventing enemy from juking, preventing escape.  
 * Global spell cheat(showing where opponents' skills were cast like invoker's sun strike, or do the opposite which automatically cast global spells to opponents even when in fog which most likely result into a kill).  
 * Automatically dodge skillshots like mirana's arrow and pudge's hook may optionally show its trajectory. Can do the opposite which is to cast accurate skillshots to opponents.  
 * Display amount of health the enemy will have left after casting all spells and showing the amount of hits before the opponent is killed.  
 * Instantly drop mana items, use soul ring, and then pick up items again.  
 * Instantly pick up dropped items by opponents(Effective only when the opponens is not scripting).  
 * Show blink range, automatically blink maximum distance.  
 * Indicate attack and skill range of heroes, units, and towers(both friendly and non friendly). This may also include creep aggro range  
 * Mark creeps when in last hit range. Alternatively, script may automatically last hit and deny with the option to or not to show the last hit marker.  
 * Let the bot play the game(player can afk but still accomplish things). You can tell which is which by their behavior. They can finish your low priority matches.  
  

That is just but a small list of what cheats these scripters/hackers are using that I saw in game. Surely, you do not want to play against players using those. In order to decrease the possibility to play with them in the future, and hopefully get them banned, we need to report these fraud.  
You can report them by opening their steam profile page, clicking report button then choose suspected cheater. There, input your description, including what they did, link(s) of the game they cheated, and evidence. If you do not know their profile if it was private or you just did not look up their profile, you can still see them by opening steam, clicking view tab, and then click players. You can see the players you recently played with there. The dotadev forums too can be used,I did report a few of them there and found that the same players were being reported. As long as their steam profile is reported, one can help make the dota 2 community better. Valve is taking action but for me I feel that they are slow because out of the 13 players I reported, only 2 of them were VAC banned.

TL;DR: Always report cheaters. This will improve the community and save the game from being exploited.~|article

An analysis of the new daily bonus hero pool: does rewarding players with a free mango affect their real-life fruit eating habits?|self.DotA2|~TL;DR: Icefrog manipulates helpless DotA2 players to eat their fruits. 

Hello everyone,


With the introduction of patch 7.07, much has been said about the changing nature of DotA2.  The game has not been static; there have been large changes to the core of the game in the last two major patches.  Some people welcome these changes, arguing in favor of keeping the game fresh, while others lament they no longer recognize the game they once loved.

Indeed, Icefrog has major influence on the direction of gameplay, but until 7.07, there has been little evidence to suggest that he is trying to also influence his player-bases real-life behavior.  The introduction of one major change to DotA2 in this patch may be a watershed moment in Icefrogs design strategy, as he shifts from solely updating the game, to slowly updating the players.  With the newly introduced feature of a rotating bonus hero pool, Icefrog presents players with a positive reward (mango) for making use of the feature (picking or randoming one of the available 10 heroes).  **Put simply, positive reinforcement is conditioning players to use the bonus pool: pick one of these 10 heroes and you get something of value in return.**  The player then considers the free mango a reward, and associates the fruit with a sense of gain.


The purpose of the following analysis will be to assess what effects the introduction of the bonus hero pool had on players real-life fruit consumption, and asks the following basic question:**did players who made use of the new bonus hero pool eat more fruit in the two weeks following the release of patch 7.07 compared to their baseline fruit consumption?**  To this end, a two part survey was designed and posted on both the DotA2 subreddit and [my Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/aDotA2Analyst) to garner participation.  The first part of the survey was posted before the release of 7.07, while the second, follow-up survey was sent two weeks after the release of 7.07 to those who participated in the first survey.  As a side note, only part one of the survey was posted on reddit and Twitter (part two was sent directly to those who completed part one), and while neither post gained much attention (less than ten upvotes on reddit, minimal likes on Twitter) it is interesting to note[ that nearly 90% of my responses came from reddit](https://imgur.com/a/KuJRK) (154 vs 21)suggesting this platforms ability to reach survey participants, even with minimal post interaction, is superior to Twitter.

In total, 175 users responded to part one of the survey.  Participants were asked to leave a unique ID (reddit or Twitter username) so their responses could be matched between the two parts.  A combination of users not responding to the follow-up survey, or not listing matching usernames between the two, led to only 64 complete responses available to accurately study (36.57% of responses in part one) , with reddit users being both more responsive, and better in leaving a matching username.  Therefore, these 64 respondents answers to both surveys were used to answer the question of whether or not their fruit consumption increased after taking advantage of the bonus hero pool.

Each survey was comprised of about ten questions which asked players about both their real life and DotA2 habits.  Ultimately, only one question from part one was relevant, while the other nine were simply there to distract respondents from identifying the purpose of this study.  That question was: How often do you eat fruits?  Available responses were: Once a day, 3 to 5 times a week, Once or twice a week, Two to three times a month, or I do not eat fruits.  The relevant follow-up questions in part two asked if players had used the new bonus hero pool (Yes or No), and also their opinion on it (Like it overall, Neutral, or Dont like it overall), in addition to how often they had eaten fruit in the past two weeks (Daily, 3 to 5 times a week, Once or twice a week, Only once or twice, or I did not eat fruit).  In order to denote change in fruit consumption, the above responses were converted to numerical ranks as seen in the table below (please note, tables may not appear properly on mobile):

Response from Part 1| Response from Part 2| Rank
---|---|----
I do not eat fruits| I did not eat fruits| 0
Two to three times a month| Only once or twice| 1
Once or twice a week| Once or twice a week| 2
Three to five times a week| Three to five times a week| 3
Daily| Daily| 4


A participants responses between two surveys could then be compared by finding the net change between the two ranked values in each survey.  For example, if a participant went from eating fruits once or twice a week (rank 2) to three to five times a week (rank 3) the net gain would be +1 (2-->3).  To test whether or not there was a net increase in the amount of fruit consumption across all 64 participants, I applied a Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test to the data, which showed no significant difference between fruit consumption before and after patch 7.07 (p=0.26).  

Roughly two-thirds of participants (42/64) stated that they had used the new bonus hero pool since the patch release.  Therefore, I repeated the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test using only answers from those 42 participants, and those data suggested that there was a significant change (increase) in the amount of fruit consumption (p=0.04).  As a further proof of principle, I next only considered the data from those 42 participants who stated they liked, or were neutral to the bonus hero pool.  The logic to exclude those who did not like the change was based on the idea that those participants would not likely view the mango as a reward, and therefore were less likely to associate real-life fruit as a positive.  Of the 42, just above 60% (26/42) either liked or were neutral to the bonus hero pool.  The full data set for the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test applied to these 26 participants can be seen below (table may not load properly on mobile):


 Rank from Part 1| Rank from Part 2
---|----
2| 4| text
2| 3| text
3| 3| text
4| 4| text
1| 3| text
2| 4| text
1| 3| text

3| 4| text
2| 3| text
3| 3| text
1| 1| text
1| 2| text
1| 3| text
2| 3| text


These results are of particular interest, as the [Z-value \(-3.4623\) yields a more highly significant corresponding p value \(0.00054\)](https://imgur.com/a/AZ40I) when only this subset of 26 participants who liked or were neutral to the bonus pool change were considered.  The mean of ranks between participants in part one versus part two also reflect a significant increase in average rank (part one=2.04, part two=2.96).   **Taken together, these results strongly suggest that those who took advantage of the new bonus hero pool had an increase in fruit consumption during the two weeks post patch 7.07 release, compared to their baseline fruit consumption pre-7.07.**


Indeed this pilot study has a number of limitations that should be addressed.  The sample size was not particularly large, especially when considering smaller subsets of data as in the text above.  Further, this study only assessed one time-point after setting a baseline, and additional data points would need to be taken over time to better understand trends in fruit eating behavior.  To statistically test the data, a ranking system akin to a Likert scale was applied to rank fruit eating consumption rates.  The Likert scale is not a perfect fit for these data, nor is it easy to test paired Likert data for significance.  There is debate in the [literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8582561) over the appropriateness of using a t-test (or other methods) versus the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test applied here.  A sign test was not used, as I preferred a way to incorporate degree of change between surveys: a simple + change does not fully capture the magnitude of going from rank 1-->4.  Even with its faults, I believe the signed-rank test can be an appropriate test for this study due to its conservative nature, with caveats of course.  

Overall, this study has presented the first evidence to date that Icefrogs patches to DotA2 can change players real life behavior.  This first of its kind paired study followed participants fruit eating habits over a two week course post-7.07 (now you get a bonus mango picking a bonus hero) and compared it to baseline consumption pre-7.07 (no bonus mangoes).  **The total cohort (n=64) did not exhibit a statistically significant increase in fruit consumption.  However, sub-cohorts of only those who had tried picking a bonus hero (n=42), and of those 42, those who liked or were neutral to the change (n=26), revealed statistically significant increases in fruit consumption.**  Thus, I propose the incorporation of a bonus mango into the game has led players to change their fruit eating habits, potentially leading to more healthy lifestyles.  Future patches should be studied in detail to assess for additional efforts by Icefrog to influence players real-life behavior.  Thank you for reading, and I look forward to your comments.

[Ars] The International 2016: the greatest event not just in Dota 2 but in all of e-sports|arstechnica.com||article esports
PH match fixing scandal turns from bad to worse; Arrow Gaming implicated|self.DotA2|~**The match-fixing scandal**    


Around five days ago, screenshots of conversations between Michael Vincent Vallejos and Jonathan Radores made rounds on Social Media. The images portray the two talking about the then upcoming [MSI-Mineski](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/4485-starladder-season-10/1182-round-robin-season/4487-south-east-asia/matches/52319-mineski-dota2-vs-msi-evogt-tric) match, a non-bearing game (as both teams have no more chance to advance) in the Starladder 10 SEA qualifiers. Vallejos is the owner of the one of the largest and arguably the most successful Philippine Dota 2 trading group named MyDota2Community, while Radores was a former pro player. The latter was involved in a [scamming incident](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/news/27395-julz-involved-in-scamming-incident-xctn-swaps-players) some six months ago, wherein he used the Steam account of Julius Julz De Leon to complete a deal involving Dota 2 items and cash.       


Among the earlier images were these conversation pictures between Vallejos and Radores, where the two talked about what supposedly will happen during the game. MSI captain JyC is supposedly having a mispick, or a bad draft, and they will also supposedly let Mineski pick Tinker. Another picture shows that JyC was asking PHP 40,000 (892~~ USD) for that game. Mineski was indeed able to get the Tinker while MSI went with a quad-melee lineup. Interestingly, MSI was actually dominating until they were ratted by the Lycan and Tinker late into the game.       


All the images were sent and/or uploaded using anonymous Facebook accounts. While the majority reacted violently regarding the matter, a number of reasonable individuals also questioned the integrity of these images. Among those, are of course, the two involved organizations in Mineski and MSI.      


Those doubts were to be quelled, however, as evidence started to pile up. [GosuGamers reported suspicious betting activities](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/news/28802-msi-and-mineski-accused-in-matchfixing-scandal) on that match, as well as the [Mineski-Immunity](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/4485-starladder-season-10/1182-round-robin-season/4487-south-east-asia/matches/52349-team-immunity-dota2-vs-mineski-dota2) match. New screenshots also resurfaced, and a video of someone skimming through Radores Facebook account was also shown. Radores claims (and for a change, it definitely appears that this was the case here) that his account was hacked, but he never questioned the content of the messages on his inbox.  
  

Somewhere between those happenings, both MSI and Mineski retracted their statement of full trust to their team (particularly MSI), and they switched into an investigative stand. They also placed the alleged involved members (the whole team for MSI, three members for Mineski) into preventive suspension, and that these players will not be allowed to join any online or offline tournaments until further notice.     


Around this time, this editor was able to verify that PHP 40,000 (892~~ USD) was indeed paid to MSI for them to throw their game against Mineski, and that Mineski threw their game against Immunity. Those were confirmed through several concerned individuals who sent uncensored screenshots to him, and these people were told first-hand that these things had taken place.     


Between all the circulating screenshots regarding the matter, there were a total of three games that were questioned - all of which are non-bearing games Starladder 10 SEA qualifier games. The matches are [Mineski-MSI](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/4485-starladder-season-10/1182-round-robin-season/4487-south-east-asia/matches/52319-mineski-dota2-vs-msi-evogt-tric) (25 Sept), [MSI-Awake](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/4485-starladder-season-10/1182-round-robin-season/4487-south-east-asia/matches/52362-msi-evogt-tric-vs-awake) (26 Sept) and [Mineski-Immunity](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/4485-starladder-season-10/1182-round-robin-season/4487-south-east-asia/matches/52349-team-immunity-dota2-vs-mineski-dota2) (27 Sept).   


**The confession and the aftermath**   


Nearly two days ago, the eight players in question approached Dexter Ancheta, who was acting as the neutral party between MSI and Mineski managements The players have admitted their involvement on the match-fixing incident. Upon forwarding their apology letter, all of them also effectively resigned from their respective teams.       
  

Trading and betting site Dota2Lounge also investigated the issue after they got wind of it on their [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/dota2loungebets/comments/2j3ft8/322_philippines_dota_revealed/). Not that any more evidence is needed after the earlier screenshots and the letter of apology, the betting history of the players supported the issue. Three MSI players betting history showed that they have placed a bet against their own team ([1](http://i.imgur.com/rwUMsHS.png) ,[2](http://i.imgur.com/cQRgmbO.png) ,[3](http://i.imgur.com/wWl8KW9.png)), and one Mineski players was [caught](http://i.imgur.com/DGYzUsF.png) doing the same.     


Vallejos betting history was also checked, and it indeed showed him betting on the fixed matches. There were three of them, but interestingly, he only had bets on two matches from those previously mentioned (This may imply that he was unaware of the MSI-Awake match-fixing). The issue has branched further anew, and its not about the [poaching and revenge issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2j7b5k/philippine_dota_2_it_is_real_and_not_only_2/).      


**Enter Malaysian team and TI4 SEA qualifier winner, Arrow Gaming.**      


Vallejos has placed large bets using multiple accounts on Arrow Gaming ([1](http://i.imgur.com/yPEGZUB.png), [2](http://i.imgur.com/KT917LO.png), [3](http://i.imgur.com/JqZudZl.png), [4](http://i.imgur.com/3nGIHBa.png), [5](http://i.imgur.com/LbXnzZr.png), [6](http://i.imgur.com/hfDFCOA.png)) on their [Synergy League Group stage match against Australian team Cant Say Wips](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/4937-synergy-league/1295-sea-groups/4940-group-a/matches/56085-can-t-say-wips-vs-arrow-gaming) last 13 October, the same day the initial screenshots of this issue first surfaced. While CSW has been on a streak heading into the match, Arrow was still the favorite. Synergy league has a forgiving format, with the top four teams of the eight-team group advancing into the next stage.     


That match was further investigated, and it has shown a number of new accounts which has high bets on this match and the several fixed matches that was mentioned earlier ([1](http://i.imgur.com/TpoeuwK.png) ,[2](http://i.imgur.com/gCkd9YS.png) ,[3](http://i.imgur.com/vqS7TZV.png) ,[4](http://i.imgur.com/4KsMoGk.png) ,[5](http://i.imgur.com/Gh0a4P5.png) ,[6](http://i.imgur.com/gbh1a03.png)). However, the most telling of the bets were the ones made on the accounts of [ddzs girlfriend](http://i.imgur.com/T53eXMu.png), as well as Lances girlfriend ([1](http://i.imgur.com/TxJklcj.png), [2](http://i.imgur.com/3kztFVU.png)). Something which may or may not be related is the latter [betting for Immunity against Mineski](http://i.imgur.com/yNLnmp2.png).    


There was a screenshot of a conversation between Vallejos and Radores, where the former said [he has many other teams by their throat](http://imgur.com/dlA3Fu0), implying that they are also under his control. However, investigation regarding the bets shows nothing of the sort, or at least nothing related to this case. First Departure, who has been experiencing a slump, expressed their feelings about the matter through their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/1stDeparture).     


The involved Philippine players, aside from their still imposed Mineski ban, wa also banned by TNC ESports, a local tournament organizer. They also lost their slot on The Summit 2s Asian qualifiers. Arrow Gaming, on the other hand, may follow similar treatment if these proof are found as conclusive. They are currently taking part in multiple tournaments, which includes Synergy League, MSI Beat It and The Summit 2.  D2L is most likely going to take a stand to not cover any games in the near future of the involved teams.   


These bet screenshots were provided by Dota2Lounge. Asked whether they think that the publics easy access to betting high value items was suspect of this incident or if they think it would have happened otherwise, D2L admin Honey has this to say:     


>Tough question. (The answer is) Yes and no. I think it is a factor that lead to the idea of creating this drama. But at the same time, people with huge power and bad intentions will always find a way to gain, regardless of morals or thought of others. So, I think this was somewhat inevitable regardless of D2L or not. 


While these findings would surely discourage any other teams who might be planning on undertaking such a treacherous action, things like this may all we be inevitable given the continuous rise of eSports, the exponential increase of tournaments and matches and the relative ease of achieving it. Honey gives a reassuring statement to deter people who has malignant intentions.     


>We're constantly keeping an eye on what's happening with bets, like suspicious bets, huge payouts, and whatnot. At the same time, upsets are a fairly common occurrence. However, when drama like this happens, we are more than willing to get to the bottom of it and provide as much information that is needed.


Dota2Lounge, by far the largest Dota 2 betting site in terms of the number of bets made, introduced value betting last 22 May of this year. This increased the actual amount of what people can bet while still maintaining the four-item bet limit, a big change from its old system of straight up counting the waged items (which can be a common, an uncommon, a rare or a key). The highest-value which can be used to bet right now is a Standard Scythe of Vyse, which would amount to a value of more or less $240 when four of this is wagered in a match.     


D2L Disclaimer: Dota2lounge has not given any opinion or conclusions regarding the matter, but are rather just presenting facts derived from their own investigation.

"To be honest, so far ESL organization is a full failure: hotel where wi-fi is shit, internet in the practice zone is lagging, not to mention that we are playing with temperature +10-15. Outside. 
So many talks about what we should do but elementary things are not done, which they should do. During the seed tourney teams have heard EVERY word of each other. This is with studio has 2 halls and they could separate teams from same matches. They wake us up at 7, bring (to practice zone) at 8, to wait before 10 for them to fix something they should have fixed yesterday.
Terrible unprofessionalism.

An analysis of the grade levels at which DotA2 heroes speak and the correlation between simple language and increased pick rate.|self.DotA2|~Hello everyone,

TL;DR: Keep it simple (for the), stupid.

Speaking in everyday life, and more so in professional settings, it is critical to get your ideas across to the audience.  Generally, it is best to keep the point you are trying to make simple so that it can be easily understood.  You don't want to confuse the other party with circuitous logic or by using complex and convoluted words that can leave the listener questioning exactly what it was they just heard.  In other words, stay on message, and keep that message simple.  A good example of this was this past election in the United States.  One of the reasons for the Republican candidate's popularity, and ultimately his election, was his use of simple messages and slogans.  A [recent study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1603/1603.05739.pdf) looked at the "grade level" at which multiple candidates' speeches were made, based on vocabulary and syntax.  The President-elect consistently spoke at a seventh grade level, while his opponents scored more like high schoolers (grades 8-10).  Simplicity, in this case, seemed to be better.  **In this study, I will apply the same "grade level" predicting tools to DotA2 heroes' voice lines, to determine if their popularity is linked to how basic their spoken words are.**

To this end, I carried out the following methods.  The entire list of a hero's spoken voice lines was collected and then submitted to the online[ Lexicon-based Reading Difficulty Prediction tool REAP](http://reap.cs.cmu.edu/demo/readability2012/index.php) (Reader-Specific Lexical Practice for Improved Reading Comprehension) from Carnegie-Mellon.  The tool would then assign a predicted "grade level" to the hero's speech based on how complex it is.  This was repeated for all heroes, and then grade levels and hero popularity were compared.  For this study, all-time number of picks per hero was used as the metric for popularity, so caveats should be made for recently added heroes, such as Underlord.  

Chart One| All Heroes| Strength Heroes| Intelligence Heroes| Agility Heroes
---|---|----|----|----
Mean Grade| 3.098| 3.351| 3.125| 2.800
Median Grade | 3| 3| 3| 3
Mode Grade| 3| 3| 3| 3


Chart one above summarizes some overall numbers from this analysis.  When looking across the board at all heroes, the average reading difficulty is third grade; this also holds true when looking at median and mode.  Right off the bat, it is clear that DotA2 heroes are speaking at a basic level, or something that we can all easily latch on to without much thought.  Teasing the data a little further, I separated heroes out into their respective class; Strength, Intelligence, or Agility.  Rather unexpectedly, Strength heroes appeared to speak at the highest level, not Intelligence heroes.  Although the three groups are clustered relatively close overall.

Now, back to the question at hand. **Is there a link between hero popularity and their language complexity?** See [graph one here](http://imgur.com/a/XShsI), where I plotted out the individual grade level for each hero.  The most popular heroes are on the left, and they decrease in popularity (number of times picked) as you go down the X-axis.  While there is no observable trend throughout the entire plot, it was clear that some of the most popular heroes scored the lowest grade level, one.  These heroes included the three top picked heroes, Pudge (by far the most picked), Phantom Assassin, and Sniper. 

To further look into this phenomenon, I decided to crunch some numbers.  In chart two below, I calculated the average number of times heroes in each grade group were picked. Grades 5 and above were combined due to the small number of heroes found in higher grades. Interestingly, there is a trend for higher grade levels to be picked less on average, and furthermore, grade one heroes are by far the most often picked group.  **This suggests there is some correlation between the complexity of a heroes voice lines, and how often it is played.**

Chart Two |  Grade 1 Heroes |  Grade 2 Heroes |  Grade 3 Heroes |  Grade 4 Heroes | Grade 5+ Heroes 
-------|---------|--------|--------|--------|----
Average number of times picked|  129,830,043|  112,825,047|  110,340,338|  106,191,182| 104,396,512

So what does this all mean?  I believe it gets back to what was mentioned at the start.  People crave simplicity and brevity when listening to others.  You want someone to pay attention?  Keep your message simple.  This principle seems to apply to DotA2 as well; we are picking heroes who speak an "easier" language.  Indeed, the three most popular heroes in the game speak at the level of a first grader, and as a group, these first grade heroes are picked more often than any other.  To put it simply, we pick what we like, and that includes a hero with a simple message.  Thank you for reading, and I look forward to your comments. 

**Author's Note:**

Some of you may have already noticed that [Io](http://imgur.com/a/nSuq0) and [Phoenix](http://imgur.com/a/tHJPl) speak at a grade level of 10, which I assume is due to the vastly superior intelligence of the computer algorithm being able to make sense of their languages, and conclude that these two heroes were speaking at a fairly high level.~|article
Complete list of dispels, undispellable buffs, magic immunity and dispels, strong dispels, etc.|self.DotA2|~TL;DR: http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel

I was looking for some kind of overview of how purges work. Some buffs could be dispelled, others couldn't. BKB removes some things, Juggernaut's spin others, diffusal blade removed some other stuff. Then there's things like Press the Attack and Apothic Shield which seems to remove just about everything... except they don't.

The ingame descriptions would only hint at "some buffs and some debuffs" to be removed but there were no consistency, and it wouldn't differentiate between the different kinds of spells. The wiki had some markers of "purgeable" abilities, but no overview; and the article about purges had a list but I could tell it was incomplete and it even had some misinformation. Exploring old DotA forums I found some post about diffusal blade interactions but it too was outdated. There were some info about triggered buffs and hardcoded buffs, but with Dota 2 not being wc3 that was mostly a moot point, there are several disparities when it comes to purges, nothing could be taken at a face value.

All in all, there were no complete, up to date overview of dispels. So I made one. 

Armed with the lobby system, cheats, a spreadsheet, some music, and a complete lack of anything resembling a social life, I went through each hero and item ability in the game and tested them vs. the different types of dispels. A few days and some 400*6 abilities later this is the result:

http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel

Now I'm no web designer, I tried to patch the info up with some collapsible tables and color coded cells to make it digestable but there's only so much you can do to hide the fact it's a giant list of a fuckton of spells. It's still very much a work in progress. On the other hand, it's on the wiki so anyone can improve it I guess.

Some disclaimers: I couldn't bother testing each and every dispel, the ones listed as "normal dispels" seemed to work exactly the same so I just took a couple from those to test with (Diffusal Blade and Euls). There used to be more differences between say manta and diffusal blade but from what I hear Valve has been patching those up.

Also, when it comes to dispels there are quite a lot of disparities/bugs between DotA and Dota 2. For instance, AA's Ice Blast is dispellable with Diffusal Blade or Manta in DotA, but not in Dota 2. And sometimes a skill is implemented differently, Shadow Fiend's damage reduction is a buff applied in an aoe in DotA that can be purged, but in Dota 2 it is a temporary aura with SF as the carrier which can not be dispelled.

This list should not be taken as a source of how dispels *should* work, but rather as a source of information of how dispels currently behave in Dota 2.

A 5.5k player's perspective on how to gain MMR.|self.DotA2|~Hi all. When ranked mm first came out I calibrated at 3.7k. I'm now 5.5k solo, though I've been hovering in and out of the leaderboards for the last week. I thought I might share some of my thoughts on gaining mmr that might be helpful/new to many of you. Everything here refers to solo queue, though most of it's also applicable to playing with friends.

1. MMR is a reflection of someone's overall skill level. However, given how complex of a game dota is, it's a relatively coarse measurement. Some people might say MMR doesn't mean anything, and they would be wrong. It is, by definition (ie, you gain mmr when you win and you lose mmr when you lose), a measurement of how capable you are at winning games.

2. As a reflection of your skill level, you can't increase your mmr in the long term (ie, ignoring short term fluctuations due to randomness) without actually becoming better at winning games. This sentence is a little vague, and some ways of making the sentence precise are false, but essentially the philosophy behind this, is that in order to increase your mmr you must either A) Become a better player, or B) Make your team play better.

3. I will first consider option (A) above - ie, getting better at dota. Now, there are tons of guides applicable to all sorts of skill ranges that discuss this in varying levels of detail, so what I'm going to focus on aren't the details. I'm going to consider the big picture, which is.

4. So how do you get better at ANYTHING? Suppose you want to learn to play Chopin's Ballade in G minor. This is a very difficult piece of music for the piano, and is about 8-10 pages long (iirc). If you want to get better at playing this, you could begin by sightreading it and trying to play the entire thing extremely slowly, which could take you as much as 20-30 minutes depending on how much you stumble. And then maybe you could do it again, and again, and again. Eventually you'll get better at the piece, but this would be an extremely inefficient way of learning the piece. Why? Because your brain doesn't have enough working memory to store the entire playthrough of the piece, along with all the little details and bits that you stumbled on, so if you stumbled on a part near the beginning, by the time you've reached the end 20 minutes later, you've probably forgotten about that stumble near the beginning, and it becomes difficult to use the memory of that stumbling to get better at playing that part in future playthroughs. Instead, what pretty much every piano student does, is to divide the piece into parts, and practice each part thoroughly before moving on to the next part. The parts may vary in length between only a few measures to an entire page, with the most difficult parts being the shortest in length (so you can play them as many times as possible in a reasonable practice session). The same philosophy holds in dota. It's really difficult to just become a better dota player without focusing on the areas you need to improve on. However, instead of dividing up dota into aspects like last hitting, map awareness, etc. I think it's just as reasonable to divide it into heroes. If you want to get better at dota, what I would advocate, is picking a small list of heroes (maybe 2-4 heroes) that you just focus on getting better at, and play them all 10-20 times each. This takes us to the next step.

5. SELF-ASSESSMENT... is hard, especially with such a complex game as dota. In fact, assessing how well you're doing, what you need to improve on, is difficult no matter what you're trying to learn. This is why people hire teachers/go to class. Now, while I think hiring a high-mmr player to coach you will definitely help you get better, I understand many dota players are poor and don't want to use what little cash they have this way (buying hats is obviously a much better use of your money o.0). Honestly, I can't tell you how to best analyze your own play. There are so many things to consider for that to write them here would make this post literally unreadable. However, I can say that honestly the key to getting better, is to *NEVER* go into a game hoping to win. Winning is great, but ultimately it is a side effect to playing well, and your goal going into every game is to *play well*. You should constantly be thinking about what *your* best next move is. Sometimes you will need to coordinate with your team, but every time you try to coordinate you should know that there's a chance they don't cooperate, in which case you should have a backup plan for what *you* should do if they don't cooperate. If you think you should gank the enemy carry but you need the help of your mid, you can ask him to help you, but if he says no or doesn't respond, going in solo would be stupid, so have a backup plan! (which could even be to just farm).

6. Why shouldn't you go into a game hoping to win? Because it's too easy to spend anywhere from 10 seconds to a few minutes dwelling on your allies mistakes (every time they happen) and pondering your own misfortune at being teamed up with these idiots instead of thinking about what you should be doing *right now*. For me, often when I hit a record mmr I become terrified of losing it, and as a result the next time I play a game and someone on my team (or even me) makes a mistake I might spend 30s arguing with them if it was their mistake or defending myself if it was my mistake, during which I just go into autopilot and stop thinking about how to best spend my time. I can't count the number of times this has caused me to lose focus, not watch the map as closely, and get ganked, exacerbating the problem. If you don't focus on winning, but instead on playing well recognizing the fact that there's roughly a 50% chance of you losing this game, then it becomes easier to just note the mistakes that were made, move on, and maintain your focus. Plus, this way, it's easier to look back on every game and feel good about the lessons you've learned that game. Whether you won or lost is irrelevant. If you're learning from mistakes then you're becoming a better player, and your mmr will naturally increase in the long term as a result. To this end, if you don't have a tough skin, don't be afraid to mute people who flame you. Personally in the loading screen of every game, I make sure I unmute everyone. Then, once the game starts, as soon as someone flames me I tell them if they keep flaming me in a nonconstructive manner I'm going to mute them, and I follow through with the promise. Yes dota is a team game and communication is important to winning, but in the end your goal should be to focus on your own play and play well, and if your teammates are making that difficult for you then muting them is the obvious solution (and may make you end up winning the game anyway thanks to your better play).

7. The next goal to have when going into a game is to use the data you get from the game to revise the model of the game that you have in your head. I can't count the number of times I've gotten doomsayers on your team saying "omg that AM is so farmed its gg", or "gg no gank spectre". Then, when the teamfights roll in their AM or specter gets hexed and blown up or somehow get kited or don't do enough damage and you win. If you find yourself saying something like that and then still end up winning the game, you should really think about at the end of the game why you were wrong. Honestly, there could be a thousand reasons. Generally this comes in two flavors. Firstly, maybe your team actually had good ways to deal with the enemy no matter how farmed they get, in which case identifying the factors that let your team deal with the enemy carry should be very valuable in making the model of dota you have in your head more accurate. Secondly, maybe your enemy carry made a mistake. Now this is much harder to identify, and unless you're a pro a lot of things you might consider mistakes actually aren't mistakes, and vice versa. Either way, even if he actually made a mistake, you should think - why did he make this mistake? What was he thinking? Is this a mistake that is often made at your mmr? For example, it's very common in mmrs below 4k to get absolute freefarm for the first 15 minutes and to think that you can just go ham on the enemy as a 1100 hp luna with treads drums midas dominator, without realizing that 1100 hp isn't actually very much and in a teamfight without a bkb you can easily get disabled and focused down before you can even press R (in fact it's an interesting aspect of dota that given two teams with exactly the same hero compositions and exactly the same items/levels, that teamfights will often be stomps in one way or the other - ie, good initiations and vision advantages via high grounds/wards is incredibly important). Anyway, if they made a mistake that is often made, then that's something you can exploit in the future when playing against a farmed <whatever>, and something you should note not to do when playing as a farmed <whatever>. In fact, if you understand why he made the mistake, you can even try to bait out the mistake by creating similar conditions in the future. For example, if 3v3 fight breaks out somewhere on the map (especially at a tower), often the other 4 heroes might watch the fight and try to decide if they should tp to help or keep farming. In that situation, the enemy carry might take an extra second to react to you trying to gank him with the 2 heroes on your team not in that fight and as a result die due to not backing up in time. Was that a mistake? Yes! Did you get lucky that he was slow to escape? Yes! But the point was that you made your own luck by timing the gank to coincide with a fight that caused him to look away from his hero.

8. Of course, the above point relies on having *accurate* data. You can't improve your theory/model of how dota works without accurate data, which is sometimes difficult to collect in game, since things often happen so fast. However, thankfully there is such a thing as the amazing downloadable replay. If you're really serious about getting better at dota, then watching your replays is an absolute necessity. Knowing what to look for in a replay is difficult and I can't really write everything down, but a few things to consider are: How did this fight start? Were we looking for a fight? Should we have been looking for a fight? If we won/lost, did I think we were going to win/lose at the beginning of the fight? How does this fit with my theory of dota? Here, the last question is especially important, as often in mmrs below 4k, the vast majority of fights are actually just a cacophony of fuckups. Everyone misses their spells or uses them on the wrong targets, people run when they should be chasing or chase when they should be running, so it's incredibly important to understand what mistakes were made (especially by you), and to understand if the fight *should* have been a win or a loss. Of course, even most <5k players won't be able to actually answer these questions correctly, but at least thinking about the question allows you to have a basepoint from which you can adjust your answers/theory of dota in light of more data from future games and similar fights. 

9. I'm getting a bit tired now and so I'll end with this last point, which is - how do you make your team play better? (ie, (B) from point 2) A lot of people are emotional when they play dota, and the variation in the quality of someone's play from game to game in part can be attributed to their state of mind. People enjoy the feeling of being a part of a cooperative team who's got each others backs, so if you can somehow instill that feeling in your teammates, you're actually improving your ability to win the game without actually being any better at dota yourself (this is the second way of gaining mmr!) There are a number of ways to do this. Essentially, you just want to be serious, but friendly. You want to limit your communication to things that are useful to your teammates, such as missing calls, pinging runes, noting which enemy heros are carrying wards, where they placed them...etc. You should *never* flame allies. It will only make them play worse. You can point out mistakes your allies made only if you are *positive* it was a mistake, and if you think they are likely to make the same mistakes again in the same game, but you want to be as *specific* as possible, and never phrase it in an aggressive tone. Give your supports farm. A 2k networth support at 30 minutes is actually worthless. If you're a core hero feel free to tell your supports to take a lane when you're off ganking or when you're strong enough to jungle. This applies to other cores too. Sometimes after I start a tp to a lane to farm the incoming creep wave, a teammate will still tp there after me. That's obviously a waste of time for us, so I would generally say something like "can I have this please", and if he still tries to compete for the last hits, I'll just move into the jungle or do something else.

10. Lastly, here's a trick I often use : At the beginning of the game, if I sense a bad atmosphere for whatever reason, I will find a reason to commend some player on my team (and actually commend them, and announce that you're commending them for <whatever>). The reason should only have to do with their attitude, not their skill, and ideally you should do this as early as possible. Everyone likes to be commended, so the person you commended will probably like you more, hence improving the team dynamics between you two, but more importantly, the people who *weren't* commended are now aware that you actually commend people, and as a result may subconsciously change their behavior in a way to also deserve a commend from you. For example, last night when I noticed that my game was on page 22 and hence I was probably playing with a bunch of 4k players, after our solo support said depressingly "great, I'm solo support again...", and proceeded to buy courier and wards, I instantly commended him and announced "commended teal for his attitude". That was honestly the best game I've ever had with a bunch of 4k strangers (he also continued to buy support items in a timely manner for the rest of the game!). Even if 3 of your teammates are already flaming each other right out of the gate, you can even commend the person who didn't say anything for "keeping a cool head" or something.

TLDR:

1. Focus on your own play. Never go into a game hoping to win. Always go into a game trying to play well and learn from mistakes.
2. Keep a model/theory of dota in your head. Constantly think about how your experiences in games fits with that model, and adjust it accordingly. Watch replays.
3. Happy teammates = better teammates. You can win games solely off of making your teammates feel good. Be friendly, but serious. Never flame. Make constructive criticism if you think it will help. Commend people for their attitude.~|article
I'm the guy who wrote those articles in PC Gamer, and I'm starting up a Dota 2 blog|self.DotA2|~That's the long and short of it. I like writing about Dota 2 and I plan to do more of it. You can find the blog, and the (silly) first post, here:

[Three Lane Highway](http://3lane.tumblr.com/)

The plan is to write one or two things a week. 

Thanks, /r/dota2! I read you every day and you seem nice.~|article
I am DDZ ! I am NOT 322 !|self.DotA2|~Hello everyone, I am ddz from ArrowGaming. Yesterday, I have been receiving many PMs from friends asking me about the accusation PacificRen throw at me and Lance at Reddit.

First, I would like to stress that I have never bet against my own team or have any intention to do so. All the competition games I have played so far, I have tried my very best to win them. 

This is my bet history (can be verified by D2L staff)

* BetHistory1 http://prntscr.com/4xh8xh
* BetHistory2 http://prntscr.com/4xh94i
* BetHistory3 http://prntscr.com/4xh9ar
* BetHistory4 http://prntscr.com/4xh9hi
* BetHistory5 http://prntscr.com/4xh9pe
* BetHistory6 http://prntscr.com/4xh9xm
* BetHistory7 http://prntscr.com/4xhaea (Arrow vs CSW game where I lost Arcana)

As for my gf's bet against my team, I totally have no idea about it. After I inquire her about this, she told me she was just helping her friend to bet. This is the conversation she had with her friend. http://prntscr.com/4xppas whereby her friend asked her to help bet. D2L has already investigated this and checked her trade history. I am in no way associated with her choice of betting or profit from it.

From the replay of Arrow vs CSW itself,it is evident that 5 of us got disconnected during the draft phase. Then during the early game phase, 5 of us disconnected again. The internet connection was really unstable that time and my PC was lagging badly during war, which is the reason why my performance wasn't so good that game.

**PacificRen claims:**
*Vallejos has placed large bets using multiple accounts on Arrow Gaming (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) on their Synergy League Group stage match against Australian team Cant Say Wips last 13 October, the same day the initial screenshots of this issue first surfaced. While CSW has been on a streak heading into the match, Arrow was still the favorite. Synergy league has a forgiving format, with the top four teams of the eight-team group advancing into the next stage.
That match was further investigated, and it has shown a number of new accounts which has high bets on this match and the several fixed matches that was mentioned earlier (1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,6).*

I just want to ask, does PacificRen has any hard evidence proving Vallejos is related to me? Has anyone checked his trade history? Are the 6 accounts belong to me? Everything was purely speculation and assumption that he knows me and I am profiting from his huge bets. Honestly, I have never heard of his name. In fact, I strongly deny my involvement in this.

The reason why people are betting against us is probably because rumor was spreading fast to everyone few hours before the game that my PC and Lance's PC were lagging. 

* Evidence1 http://prntscr.com/4xk2jv (Lance chat with gf before match)
* Evidence2 http://prntscr.com/4xfn4e (My chat with a friend before match)

As for Lances girlfriend, all the time she has always been betting on/against the team independently. http://prntscr.com/4xhi6a as you can see, she bet against our team on 2/7/2014 as she feels Titan was a stronger team than our team during that time. I think it was pretty obvious before TI, Titan was a better team. There was no one talking about this. This is her decision and Lance honestly has no control over her. Also, her bets were relatively moderate http://prntscr.com/4xk2wz . Her friend also did suggest to her to bet on team CSW, http://prntscr.com/4xk4mr along with another friend who asked her to help him place bets along with her own bets on team CSW http://prntscr.com/4xkban , http://prntscr.com/4xkbhj. She also did ask Lance about his teams condition and made her own decision to bet on which team: http://prntscr.com/4xk2jv

Another question I would like to raise, there are no rules stating players gf isnt allowed to bet. Alright, if you are saying the girlfriends are closely related to the players and there might be a conflict of interest/insider info leaked out. 

**What about people who are active in e-Sports and well-known in the scene? Are they allowed to bet?**

Everyone knows you are quite well-known in the SEA scene with close relationship with all the professional players. This is evident from your position where you were a senior Dota2 editor in GGnet, writer for Pacific.eSports and close-friends with other well-known Dota2 players in the scene. Does this mean you shouldnt be betting too right? Like I know you are good friends with all the PH Professional Dota2 players, etc. We can also ask ourselves did you ever bet against your friends and won. You also knew something right? 

Evidence 1 - http://prntscr.com/4xq5uf (taken from your bet history)
(You were betting against Mineski your countryman, do you have insider info they will lose that day? 2 arcanas were bet that day.)

I think its quite unfair to point all the fingers at us just because the guy who mastermind the 322 scandal Vallejos had huge bets on my team when all of them had never heard of his name before. Also I would like to stress that I have no control over my girlfriend. She can bet on me or against me, its entirely up to her. Like I said, PacificRen is quite well-known in the PH Dota scene and the guy or 'judge' HANDLING this investigation. Yet, he himself is betting against a team he should be favoring, should he be suspected of matchfixing too?

I try to be as honest as possible and sometimes, my pc lags or internet lags, I just tell my friends the truth when they ask me. Then, I have no control what they do with this information. Its entirely out of my control.

Personally, my team's issue is totally different from the matchfixing between MSI and Mineski. For that case, there was clear evidence with supporting chat messages that Vallejos had direct contact with their players. For our case, we have no idea who this guy is and I think it's unfair for PacificRen to implicate and associate our case with theirs.

The main question for our situation is the line drawn between the players and the person who are betting against them. Whether it's the girlfriend/family members/close friends, there should be a clear rule stating they are not allowed to bet. This question has never been raised before and after the finding of this association, everyone just point the fingers at us claiming we matchfixing. This is totally unfair to us.

That's all from me. You are free to judge.

"This week, I spoke with Victor Goossens, the co-CEO of Team Liquid, the group that won TI7 and collected a prize of $10,862,683. Not every team operates like Liquid, which is a pro organization with investor funding and e-sports teams represented in League of Legends and Counter-Strike. It covers the expenses of its five Dota players and provides them with training facilities, all the PC hardware they could ever want, and support services like a mental coach. Oh, and an annual salary that ranges between $100,000 and $200,000. At the conclusion of TI, the $10 million was split eight ways between the organization, the five players, and the dedicated manager and coach. Goossens tells me that winning TI was the biggest day in Team Liquid history, which Im inclined to read was as important economically as competitively. How does a team like Liquid survive without winning TI?"~|article esports

Okay so who the heck are all these new names appearing in Chinese Dota following the reshuffle? Let me tell you.|self.DotA2|~Almost every major Chinese team is now featuring at least one player that is likely completely unheard of for most fans. Here's some quick information (players are presented in order of their team positions):

**Invictus Gaming:**  
*qd,Ferarri_430, Xxs, Boboka, rong*  
  
IG has promoted it's academy team, IG Vitality, to the main squad, whilst retaining 430. These players were previously apart of Team DK.S and where acquired by IG to form IG.V when Team DK closed it's doors in late 2015. qd also played under the ID black.z. Prior to being recruited by Team DK these players had no prior professional experience and were coached by Burning. Under the banner of DK.S they enjoyed limited success for such a short period of time playing, notably winning the Chinese open qualifier for the Frankfurt major and defeating FanTuan and IG in the group stages.

**Invictus Gaming Vitality:**  
*Yuno, Op, InJuly, dogf1ght, super*  

This team undoubtedly has more recognisable names than the main IG squad. Super and Yuno both drop down from the main team and are joined by Op, InJuly from FanTuan and dogf1ghts from Vici Gaming Potential.

The names super and InJuly probably ring a few bells from the Chinese qualifers for TI4 where DT^Club made their run upsetting notably TongFu, HGT and CDEC but also New Element (with Shiki) and Orenda (with Zyf). These players (Air, InJuly, XDD, Super, Xiaotuji (aka Rabbit), Prettyhaw) have all done the rounds many, many times notably coming together on Dream Time (DT^Club) and Rising stars, but also splitting up onto various t2 Chinese teams. I could go through their history here but it's not much of a story so much as it is Chinese T2 club pass the parcel. The point is they've been around for a long time, just as long as many of the big names in Chinese Dota 2.

Yuno is the Chinese 8000 MATCH MAKING POINTS player, being the first to reach 8K on their servers and being recruited by Yaphets (aka PIS) when he rebooted the Immortal Magneto team last year. He followed Yaphets to form a new team, FanTuan, with ZSMJ when he left HGT following the Frankfurt Major qualifiers. After the team failed to qualify for the Winter Major, he was recruited into Invictus Gaming to replace Ferarri_430 who was on a break following IG's poor performance in the same event.

Dogf1ghts was noticed when standing in for T2 Chinese teams like CNB.cn and LAI gaming (another incarnation of DT Club featuring Xz who would play offlane for CDEC in their 2nd place finish at TI5). Following this he was recruited to join Vici Gaming Potential.

I think Op is brand new to the scene. IG didn't give the players real names in their announcement which made it harder to find information on this guy. If he played for other teams or is on the MMR leaderboard, it's under a different ID.


**LGD Gaming**  
*Agressif, Maybe, xiao8, September, MMY*  

Likely the only really unfamiliar name here is September, with both Agressif and Maybe breaking into the pro scene from LGD's CDEC initiative. September joins LGD from CDEC.Avenger - one of their academy teams. CDEC.A notably won the first Chinese open qualifier for the Shanghai major defeating EHOME.KING 2-0 in the final. In the main qualifier this team finished first in their group defeating Wings and Newbee.Y 2-0 and trading with Newbee and CDEC.Y (former CIS game minus Black^). In the next stage they were defeated by IG.V (now IG) and Newbee dropping out of the qualifier.

**Vici Gaming:**  
*Burning, CTY, rOtK, HYM, jdh*  
  
One of the more 'star studded' teams with veterans Burning and rOtK. CTY got his start in the original Dota 2 roster for Vici Gaming back in 2012 after coming up through the 'VG Esports Academy'. Alongside him on this team were Fy and Fenrir as well as Sydm aka Mikasa who was the only member of the team with competitive experience and would go on to make a big name for himself as a coach. After the team failed to qualify for TI3 it fractured with CTY disappearing from the competitive scene until he reemerged on Team DK's rebuilding squad after their TI4 team went their separate ways. From there he was 'loaned' to EHOME which turned out to be a permanent move.  
  
Both HYM and jdh have played on various T2 Chinese teams. HYM registered with HyperGloryTeam in September last year in the 3 role, however he will now be playing support. jdh was one of the original members of Speed Gaming's Chinese squad. From here he played for Wings Gaming with other members of this team after they were released by their organisation. jdh's next move was to join EHOME.KING - one of their two academy teams - where he also played under the ID of hydsb and notably played with former MVP Pheonix TI5 carry kphoenii who joined EHOME.KING following TI5.

**Vici Gaming Reborn:**  
*Zyf, NoNo, Yang, Fy, DDC*
  
VG's academy team 'Vici Gaming Potential' has rebranded to Vici Gaming Reborn. Zyf aka YJ aka END has a story that goes back to post TI3 WPC Ace Dota 2 League Season 1. As a part of this team, two amateur teams were formed and coached by ACE - the Chinese Esports regulatory body. Zyf played on WPC-A which was picked up by TongFu as an academy team - one of the first of it's kind in China - and was rebranded TongFu WanZhou. This team would go on to lose every single match it played in the league. This was the same tournament where the new DK squad (Burning, Mushi, Ice3, MMY!, Lanm) went 14-0 on the tail end of the 6.78 patch and featured the famous Bo7 comeback in the DK-IG finals with the legendary 3 hour break. I'm not 100% sure on the details, but I believe Zyf was actually cut from the team about half way through the league and before it was sponsored by TongFu. Following this he disappeared for a little while, but then entered WPC Ace Dota 2 League Season 2 which featured only a single amateur team this time around. Orenda won this competition and Zyf was on it in the offlane role. Perhaps his big break was after TI4 when Vici Gaming bought and dismantled CIS Game keeping Black for itself and selling June to IG. The remainder of this team was rebranded LV Gaming in collaboration with LGD who added Lin aka AllBeautyMustDie and longtime LGD veteran, now discarded, DDC to the squad. Zyf was the 5th member of this team and played carry. This team would be aquired and developed into the new roster for EHOME where Zyf would achieve Top 6 at TI5. Following this he was sold to Vici Gaming who then acquired Burning resigning the talented youngstar to their academy team.

Yang was first noticed by the western audience when he joined the original incarnation of Vici Gaming Potential in early 2015. In the clubs announcement of the team they state that he previously played for Dream Gaming, and was a 'Sina Cup Supernova Champion' from which I can only deduce meant that he was on one of the two teams that qualified to the main event from the 128 team open qualifiers group stage. It seems likely that he played for Ogura Yui as there isn't much information out there about this team, although he could have been on New Element (which was also the team that gave Agressif and Shiki their start prior to CDEC's formation). Most of the player names for the open qualifier teams are in Chinese characters which makes it hard for me to track down who he was playing with.

Like September, NoNo played for CDEC.A. As far as I know this was the beginning of his career. The only mention I could find of him was on the Chinese MMR leader boards where he places inside the top 20 with ~~7100 MMR.


**Newbee**, (*Hao, Mu, xz, Kaka, ChuaN* )  **EHOME** (*Lanm, Old Chicken, Eleven, Ice3, Fenrir*) and **CDEC** (*Rabbit, Super, Yao, Garder, Q*), whilst exciting for their fans don't really contain any unrecognisable names.

An analysis of heroes' speech patterns: what personality data extracted from heroes' own words can tell us about them.|self.DotA2|~**TL;DR: Skeptical heroes who like art and the greater good are best.** 

Hey Everyone,

**Introduction:**  In past analyses I have focused on the outwardly observable aspects of heroes and how those might affect pick and/or win rates.  The most direct example of [which is seen here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2l2nln/an_analysis_of_facial_attractiveness_in_dota2_are/) where the facial attractiveness of each hero was compared to pick rates.  However, looks, as they say, are not everything.  When Faceless Void respawns, are you drawn to his absent-eyed expression, or his cultural refinement, as evidenced by mastery of simile (Like the sun, I rise again.)?   It is reasonable to assume that some subset of the DotA2 community considers personality just as, if not more important than appearance.  Therefore, the purpose of this study was to extract personality data from each hero and study these data in relation to both win and pick rates.  This presented a challenge--when studying attractiveness, the obvious source of data was hero faces; how to collect personality information is less clear.  

**Methods:** As it is currently not feasible for heroes to take online personality tests, I decided to study personality based on verbal communications.  While what we say to others does not fully represent who we are, it is the most accessible, usable data for DotA2 heroes.  Therefore, every voice line a hero uses in game was collected from the [DotA2 Wiki](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Sniper_responses) and submitted to [IBMs Watson Personality Insight online tool](https://watson-pi-demo.mybluemix.net/), which is described as [a]service [which] uses linguistic analytics to extract a spectrum of cognitive and social characteristics from the text data that a person generates through blogs, tweets, forum posts, and more. The output from this tool gave both quantitative assessments of each heros scores in Big 5 Personality categories, but also general descriptions of personality traits based on those scores.  Of note, Io and Phoenix were unable to analyzed by this tool due to their inability to produce words.

**Results:** For the full album of all text-based personality reports [please follow this link](http://imgur.com/a/QHAcD).  You will see that each hero has multiple paragraphs describing their characteristics.  In addition to this data, I also recorded all of the percentage based quantitative scores, an example seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/uDsEYWn.png).  For this initial pilot study of personalities, I decided not to try to analyze everything, but instead to pick select interesting points of data from multiple points: **1)** the quantitative personality data, **2)** the first line of the text report, which gives a simple personality explanation for each hero, and **3)** the traits listed in the additional sections of text and.  The data below is organized in this manner.

**Results 1: Quantitative personality data.**  Many traits were reported in this data set, but I will focus on two: the fiery and hedonism scores.  First, I selected heroes that can be described as fiery and compared their fiery scores to that the rest of the hero pool.  The results are summarized below, and indicate that overall, fire heroes score nearly 5% less in the fiery trait than other heroes.  	


Fire Hero| "Fiery" Score
---|---|----
Batrider| 28%
Clinkz| 32%
Doom| 31%
Dragon Knight| 28%
Ember Spirit| 25%
Huskar| 34%
Jakiro| 32%
Lina| 23%
Ogre Magi| 48%
**Average fiery score of fire heroes**| 31.22%
**Average fiery score of all other heroes**| 36.07%

It is possible that fire-related heroes are already fiery enough in outward appearance or abilities and thus dont need as fiery of a personality as others who compensate for their lack of outward fire with inward fire.   Of note, Ogre Magi is an outlier at a 48% fiery score compared to his other fire heroes, which I attribute to the presence of two heads and personalities.  Jakiros two heads do not result in a higher score because one is ice based.

In respect to hedonism scores, I took 54 heroes with the highest, and 54 heroes with the lowest hedonism percentages and compared the pick rates of the two groups.  Overall, I found the group with lower scores were picked at a higher rate (9.81%) than their counterparts with higher hedonism scores (8.60%).  This trend towards picking heroes that are less focused on self-pleasure will be seen again further in this analysis, and thus suggests players are more interested in picking heroes who focus on more than themselves.

**Results 2: First line of text report.**  You can appreciate that there are several different characteristics describing heroes in the first line, yet many heroes were assigned the same traits.  Two that stood out in particular were shrewd and skeptical.  I noticed that not a single hero was described as both shrewd and skeptical, leading one to believe there is some stark contrast between heroes described as shrewd vs skeptical.  Below, I compared the two groups' win rates:



Personality type| Number of heroes| Matches played| Matches won| Winning percentage
---|---|----|----|----
Shrewd| 44| 3,331,208,172 | 1,652,387,621 | 50.40%
Skeptical| 57| 4,642,159,771 | 2,273,441,372 | 51.03%

I attribute the slightly higher winning percentage of skeptical heroes to one of two things: either the apparent advantage that being doubtful has over cleverness.  Being skeptical of surroundings in DotA2 leads to questioning, which leads to smarter team play, which may be more of a benefit than over-confidence from being shrewd.  That, or statistical chance.  

**Results 3: Additional sections of text report.**  There is a lot to sort through in these paragraphs, however I chose to focus on two areas.  First, I studied 22 heroes that were described as unconcerned with art.  As seen below, these 22 had a 1.2% lower winning percentage than all other heroes, leading to the conclusion that a lack of appreciation for art correlates with lower hero success.

Personality type| Number of heroes| Matches played| Matches won| Winning percentage
---|---|----|----|----
Heroes unconcerned with art| 22| 1,335,050,650  | 643,329,781 | 48.20%
All other heroes| 86| 7,295,769,497  |3,604,102,078  | 49.40%

Additionally, I sought to study any differences between top 10 win/pick rate heroes versus bottom 10 win/pick rate heroes.  Overall, I found that in both of the top 10 groups, there were significantly more heroes described as preferring activities with a purpose greater than personal enjoyment than the bottom 10s.  Thus I conclude that heroes who put the greater good above themselves are both more desirable to pick, and are more suited to win. Data summarized below:








Table| Bottom 10 win rate| Top 10 win rate| Bottom 10 pick rate | Top 10 pick rate
---|---|----|----|----
**Heroes preferring greater purpose**| 1| 6| 1| 7
^(**Bottom 10 win rate:** Io, Oracle, Earth Spirit, Shadow Demon, Morphling, Broodmother, Lone Druid, Puck, Anti-mage, Enchantress)  
^(**Top 10 win rate:** Abaddon, Omniknight, Necrophos, Zeus, Wraith King, Warlock, Lich, Spectre, Centaur Warrunner, Ursa)
^(**Bottom 10 pick rate:** Oracle, Winter Wyvern, Chen, Visage, Elder Titan, Earth Spirit, Io, Phoenix, Beastmaster, Shadow Demon)
^(**Top 10 pick rate**: Pudge, Sniper, Phantom Assassin, Juggernaut, Invoker, Axe, Riki, Mirana, Bloodseeker, Drow Ranger)

The presence of Io and Phoenix in the bottom 10 groups is notableheroes without obvious personalities are likely less relatable, and thus picked less.

**Conclusions:** Overall, this pilot study just scratched the surface of available personality data. Additional studies for a more in-depth look are encouraged (if anyone would like the raw data PM me and I can send it along!) However, it is clear that certain traits have an effect on both hero pick and win rates.  Thank you for reading, and I look forward to your comments.

Why Valve must take the situation in hand on the cosmetics controversy and why this will never happen.|self.DotA2|~**PREAMBLE**: First of all i want to clarify that i tend to be pungent and sarcastic but this will serve to point out what is truly important to me. I hope you will focus on the validity of the arguments and will contribute to the discussion constructively.
Also i hope to receive enough material from your comments, in order to make a report as much as possible complete which can summarizes the different points of view of the community.

Criticism is always appreciated and incouraged but please keep the discussion serious and constructive.

Also English is not my native language but i tried to write as clearly as possible, have mercy!

**SHORT STORY**: As I think we all know, Valve has (not so) recently succumbed to various temptations, releasing, for those whom the lore and aesthetic features that characterizes Dota from every other game counts, questionable Sets who break the lore and the aesthetic of the game/character in various ways.

**CONTROVERSIAL SETS**: 

**[Alpine Ursa Set] (http://www.pcgamesn.com/sites/default/files/Alpine%20Ursa.jpg)**: A fiery ursine tribe warrior is cosplaying a cowboy. Maybe it wanted to result a german yodeler but it still looks like a cowboy fit to me. 
Does not respect: Colour scheme (Pink neon shirt), Silhouette (Cowboy hat), Lore (Cowboys are related to far west, not dota nor ursine tribes nor Ursa past, present or future).


**[Dread of the Gleaming Seal PA Set] (http://www.dota2.com/store/itemdetails/20306)**: no longer has a one handed blade but a two handed scythe.
Does not respect Silhouette and Pose.

How Valve made that set legit, as CyborgMatt stated in a recent article: *"Due to the nature of shape of the Scythe used in the Alliance branded Loda set for PA we have some new animations for idle, attacking and loadout for the Dread of the Gleaming Seal set."*

**Nyx Assassin**:  Some users stated that the Alpha Predator Set seems to be problematic on low details graphics because it seems that Spiked Carapace is always active.

**[NaVi Qop Set](http://www.dota2.com/store/itemdetails/20213)**: no longer has a dagger but a mace (her first ability is dagger based), no more a crown but a helmet. Does not respect her Silhouette.
This set was controversial especially because NaVi designers were starting to work on more controversial sets, like the [AM one] (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=153775758) or the [Dazzledemon one] (http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=181636596).

**[Gifts of the Shadowcat Drow Set] (http://www.dota2.com/store/itemdetails/20316)**: a deadly ranger is now cosplaying a cute Cat.
Does not respect: Colour scheme (Pink details instead of different shades of blue), Silhouette (Cat ears are for cats or human cosplayers, not for drow rangers) and Lore (*Lithe and stealthy, icy hot, she moves like mist in silence. That whispering you hear is her frozen arrows finding an enemy's heart. Stealth, silence, subtlety.*) Does that description collide with a cute purring pinky cat?
If I were drow ranger, grew up with humans but always stranger to them and more likely drows, I would not have braided my hairs in a such feminine manner, nor I would have used pink laces to do so, nor I would have put on myself animal remains to result cute, but to result scary. I am still wondering where can I find a pinky shadowcat.

**COMMUNITY ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE RECENT CHANGES**:

* Valve gave the community the Guidelines and those have to be respected in order to preserve the identification of the heroes in game

http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/workshop/Dota2CharacterArtGuide.pdf

* Every set must be compatible with the lore in order to preserve the unique nature and coherence of every hero

http://www.dota2.com/workshop/requirements

* *"The aesthetics of Dota 2 are build from a set of principles that help keep each hero immediately and uniquely identifiable. It is important that the set remain **artistically consistent with the original design**." (Valve)*

* Dota must preserve his nature and his design without become the next TF2 or LoL in order to preserve is own life.

* The release of Cat-Drow Ranger is now launching a new LoL-like trend which tends to stereotype the characters ignoring their personalities.
Designs like [this one] (https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/q71/1012764_761305060552352_1218924063_n.jpg) who transform the aggressive and proud Lina into a cute sailor moon or even a foxfire Ahri version, are now taking place


**COMMUNITY CONTRA ARGUMENTS**:

* The point about QoP's mace being bad because of her "dagger based skill" is a stretch. Almost every tidehunter set changes his anchor but he still uses ANCHOR SMASH. Same goes for Axe.

* the workshop is such a pain to navigate and vote in that I personally don't bother

* If you dont like it dont buy it

* Without changing the colors and the shape we cant have original and distinctive sets

* Sponsored items help Esport and Pro players/teams, so it is legit to be more accommodative with that

* The majority of the community voted for it

* Cat ears make drow more unique and special

* I dont care about cosmetics as the game is f2p

* I love ursa cowboy set, there is nothing wrong with it

* Make a chinese themed set for every hero is a good compromise to expand the market of dota 2 in the east

* Dota 2 is not a RPG game, I dont care about the lore

* The only problem with the items is the loophole allowing almost anything bundled with a ticket or affiliated with an entity into the game.


**PERSONAL TOUGHTS**:

As most of you understood, I do not wish a deconstructuralization of the characters in a pure commercial way. This is one of the main reason that made Dota 2 a special game, so original that doesnt need to push on stereotypes like LoL.

The way we took (not so) recently is demeaning all this.

I know they are only cosmetics but if you guys reflect a bit, you will agreed with me that we got more people interested in this than players interested in the game. And this is making our game experience even worst.
I also left LoL because i really felt it childish and visually boring (big boobs and cute designs for every female character who transform them in a continuous sexual recall) and i really dont wanna leave dota for the same reason.

**Minor changes of base models**

I remember the **portrait change** of Lina and WR or even Mirana, to push some huge boobs into the screen. Is this not sad for you? Are you really fine with transforming even WR? I mean, she was special, different, sometimes less is better.

I would also clarify that I am in any way a fkn feminist as someone of you stated. I dont wanna put a burqa on QoP, I love her! And i love the naive blonde CM or the fiery Lina as much as I love other particular characters that are not so much feminine such as PA or Spectre. Those ones are the most interesting and particular to me. And I think that diversity is a  valor that must be preserved. This is my only point with that sexualization thing. It is ok to have sexualized chars and it is good to also have something different. Same goes with male characters. We have AM and we have Waifustealer. We HAD Pudge. We will lose Lifestealer a day? I really hope not.


**Idea for the Workshop**: an initial screening from Valve to decide what respects the guidelines and what not. So we can prevent the tons of garbage that is now present and we can also prevent bad trends.
But more important: we can make the workshop **easier to navigate**. There is no reason to keep a spoon for Sven. If we decrease the amount of superfluous material, more users will be glad to vote.

**My personal Idea of distinctive set**:

[DK Father of Dragons] (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=165683781) 

[QoP Wicked Succubus] (http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4zun0xlE8pk/UZbt_Z0B5sI/AAAAAAAAAXw/V3EqKahYbhA/s1600/ingame.jpg)

No need to break anything to be original and distinctive.

I want also to say that this post brought mainly cosmetics examples BUT it is way to put your attention on a fact: that the philosophy behind the game is changing and the minor changes to some base models are a sign of that new trend. This way i predict that in the future the game will be made easier for novices, removing certain mechanics who made it more difficoult. I am talking about absurd, but *1984 from Orwell* was absurd too at his time. 

**CONCLUSION AND QUESTIONS:**
Why is the sexualization and the stereotyping AND the lore-	incoherence the ONLY way to make Dota 2 remunerative? Is this really the only way? Are you ok or even happy with that changes? Where do those changes will lead us in the near future?

Thanks for reading!

An analysis of teeth in DotA2: do visible chompers influence pick rate?|self.DotA2|~Hey everyone,

Lets clear the air and talk about the elephant in the room.  Im not talking about Cthulhuphant (you remember that thing from HoN, right?  Another bastardized creation from the people that brought you Beardulon, or The Learnatoriumbut I digress).  If youre anything like me, you know that choosing a hero has its fair share of challenges.  Youll look at what your teammates have already picked and scan the board for something yourself.  That one could be good, but what about him?  Maybe if we have her supportwait, this one is even better.  **But oh God look at his teeth.**

Teeth.  We all have them.  Or most people do, at least one or two if not the full set.  Humans have become reasonably accustomed to teeth; smiles somehow became a social norm.  But I think deep down in all of us there is a fear of seeing anothers teeth.  More often than not, baring teeth in the animal kingdom is a warning to induce fear.  This fear still lingers in our DNA, a gift from our ancestors and previous branches on the evolutionary tree.  **Which begs the question; are we wary of picking heroes who have their teeth showing in hero portraits?**

Table 1| Strength| Agility| Intelligence| Total
---|---|----|----|----
**All heroes with exposed teeth**| 17| 11| 17| 45
**Dire heroes with exposed teeth**| 10| 9| 12| 31


To begin to look at this question, lets look at what kind of hero shows their teeth in the first place.  From the table above, we can see that out of all 110 heroes 45 have exposed teeth.  Of those 45, 31 are Dire.  In regards to hero class, both 17 Strength and Intelligence heroes show teeth, while only 11 Agility heroes do the same.  In each class, the Dire dominates dental displaying numbers: 10/17 Strength, 9/11 Agility, and 12/17 Intelligence heroes come from the north side of the map.  Therefore, I conclude that **heroes that are evil (from the Dire) are more likely to bare their teeth in hero portraits.**

Now lets jump to the crux of the issue and look at the two big questions. 1) Are heroes showing teeth less likely to be picked than those that do not?  And 2) which group is more likely to win?  The table below tells the tale.  **On average, heroes that do not have exposed teeth are picked at a 5% higher rate on than their counterparts.**  These data promisingly hint that fear of teeth play a part on the picking screen, although further data collection and analysis will be needed to draw any conclusions.  That being said, heroes with chompers out have a slightly higher win rate, although not significantly higher by any means (< 1%).  



Table 2| Heroes with exposed teeth| Heroes without exposed teeth
---|---|----
**Total number of heroes**| 44*| 64*
**Total number of times played**| 2,379,414,307| 3,637,702,842
**Average number of times played**| 54,077,597.89| 56,839,106.91 (+5.10% higher)
**Average win rate**| 49.10%| 48.45%

^Data ^taken ^from ^all-time ^statistics ^on ^Dotabuff.com.  ^*Winter ^Wyvern ^and ^Oracle ^excluded ^from ^exposed ^and ^without ^exposed ^teeth ^respectively ^due ^to ^recent ^introduction.

In summary, the data presented here suggest **bared teeth may be an important aspect of the hero portrait which influence players picks.**  Further independent and in-depth studies will be needed to validate this hypothesis.  Thank you for reading and I look forward to your personal anecdotes and opinions.

TL;DR: You might be afraid of teeth.

Burning: New iG has vibrant environment, good chemistry. I intend to get married next year. (Translated)|self.DotA2|~By Burning, , original article by ImbaTV 
http://www.imbatv.cn/special/xinsheng/11/

TI6 qualifier was my last match on VG squad, we lost, and I was lost. I finally recovered from that and did full coverage of TI6 along side Rotk. Looking back, it was a rough time but it was ok after all. I was a bit lost and disappointed: after so many years since TI2, it was my first time not making it to Seattle. The failure prompted me to play carry for another year, a position Im used to, because I was not contempt of loosing playing a position Im not that familiar with. 

After so many years of relationship with Rotk, I feel hes still a great captain. He will arrange the detail of each position from a draft and strategic point, making it easy for us to play through the games. Maybe he isnt the best in the core mechanics of Dota, compared to other top offlaners in China in terms of hero pool, mechanics, and game sense. In our training and daily life, Rotk unites the whole team in his ways. For example when we lost a game, we would get mad at the heat of the moment, which lead communication failure and even bad argument. Rotk would only talk about the issue itself, with his own way of wording, making us wish to improve together. 

After TI6, Rotk was planning to retire, and the only team member remaining on the VG squad was HYM. I wasnt too excited to play on such squad. When Fenrir left ehome, he convinced Rotk to play another year, making a new team. But I think their style might not be the one I would fit in. At the time, there were not many teams left, so I came to IG when I got their offer. 

The new iG squad is 2 veteran + 3 new stars. Regarding our chemistry, we are at a good position. Maybe its because we only formed not long ago and many problems havent surfaced yet. If it was like the old times, a team with too many veterans would have many problems, such as lack of passion and strive. Right now we have passion to say the least. We still have many things remains to be fixed: our strategy is lacking, our in-game response is still bad, we need to continue working and accumulate our experience through matches. 

My play style has been shifting now. I used to play to the extremes of fighting or farming. After my support experience in this half-year, I feel my read on the game and my balance on fighting and farming have improved. Our mid player op (Chinese username: marine) is a farming mid, I would get fighting carries like Naix to create farming space for him, letting him to be that infinite fat Carry in late game. On one hand our roles are determined by the patch, on the other hand they are also determined by our individual capability: Op is a extremely good mid. 

As the oldest player in the team, I still might be the iconic player in others eyes, while xxs and op are truly shining in our games. As a veteran, I would pass on the experience to them. I would watch replays through their player perspective and tell them what should and shouldnt be done, helping them accumulate experience in various situations in the games. 

My teammates all have distinct personalities. Op (Marine), this guys talks a LOT, and hes funny. He cant rest for a day, just being the best lubricant of team chemistry. The only thing he needs to work on is his hero pool. Our offlaner XXS: a very young, very strong player. He has his unique understanding of game, prompt initiation, good mechanics and attention to details. Its a pleasure playing with him. Our position 4 support Boboka: Hes quiet, almost a complete opposite to OP. But he is strong and understand the game to a great depth, overall a very down-to-earth player. Our position 5 support Q, the TI5 2nd place support, our drafter. When I draft, I get lost sometimes, forget many things, and easily distracted by my teammates suggestions. Q considers almost every aspect of drafting. He also discuss with us during drafting, filtering out our gibberish, this is golden for a drafter. Our team manager ZaiZai, he was the manager for TI6 champ Wings. His success has a reason: he managed our training to almost perfect. 

I understand Hao & Mus retirement completely. Nowadays, players need to balance training, match, and streaming, including the daily pubs to maintain their form. You only have so much time, and the pressure from the fans would finally get to you. There used to be a time, forums and comments are mostly encouragement or pure discussion of the game. Now its just people flame for the sake of flaming. If a player played badly, maybe he would be flamed till he quits. Im now used to all these jazz and no longer concerns the pure flames. But some of the newer players might still be affected by the flaming, which would subsequently affect their competition. You get tired from mind to body at some point. I took a break as well, but I still cant rest completely and competed in DAC. 

Regarding the incident of Puppey, Ive got to know a thing or two. I am not close to Puppey so I wouldnt make too many comments. But if the allegations are true, it must be accumulated over time. The more titles and fame you get, the more arrogant you get, then you would do such things, making yourself violent. Ive heard EHOME has professional psychologist for counseling. I think as E-sports continues to develop, psychological counseling is necessary and helpful in the long run. 

Our next tournament is Nanyang, then Major. We will try our best. We are gelling as a team fast after the shuffle. If we would be playing the Major qualifier tomorrow, we should be able to win. But other teams would improve in the mean time. Right now in the scene there are many small tournaments, and they are replacing our scrims. We are in the mind set to use these small tournaments to practice and round up our strategy. I feel the pressure is mostly on the big tournaments such as the Major. I predict the strong teams in Chinese scene will include LGD: their recent performance is good and they have some stacked line-up. EHOME: Their performance has ups and downs, they win brilliantly yet they loose in the most strange manner, but when a big tournament comes up, you can always put your bet in them to get results; Wings, Theyve been taking a break and their games right now are probably attempts to develop new strats. Its common for them to loose, but they sure have the power in them. In terms of strong teams in foreign regions, EG as they just won MDL. Basically they are regarded as the No.1 in raw talent. But as of now, many teams are recovering from the reshuffle. Some new teams still need time to develop their strategy and experiment. You cant judge their success from the current results, time will tell. 

Since Oct 2008, it has been 9 years, Ive accumulated some fans. Someone asked my why I get liked by many people, yet I dont have the answer. Maybe its because of my honesty. After playing for so many years, one will always get some fans and fame. The fame doesnt cause me trouble in my daily life. The occasional encounters with random fans on the street only cost a minutes, saying Hi, taking pictures, and its done. Fans are rational. At first when I got many fans, I didnt become arrogant, instead I put much pressure on myself to meet the fans expectation. For example in 2011, we had many wins in 2010, then for the first half of 2011, we didnt have anything. I felt immense pressure, through out the year even after we started wining in the later half of the year. Now Im playing with a calm heart, long as I dont leave any regret. Maybe Wings would face these pressures that burdening their heart, but its just a process in progressing. 

Regarding the picture where Wings standing behind me in WPC, its not like we were teaching them. I remember I was testing my machine at the time, and they were just back there. All their results came from their hard work. The championship run by Wings proves their power. I think outside influence such as brackets and sort only accounts for 20% of your chance to winning, the rest 80% is on yourself. Wings is the truly deserving Champion. 

Q&A 
Q: Who is the better poker player in Doudizhu (A chinese poker, translate to fight the landlord), you or Rotk?

A: Its unquestionable, for people who watch our stream, I rekt him. 

Q: Who is the better drinker, you or Sylar?

A: 50/50. 

Q: Do you know why your nick name Xu di lei (di lei: land mine) come from (Burnings Chinese name is Xu zhi lei, zhi lei -> di lei is a small word play by substituting the mid character with another character to construct new words, in this case land mine also pictures burning lying rolling over the ground when drunk)? 

A: I heard theres this one time after I drink, I was rolling all over the ground, maybe there was something like that once. But Sylar did that too, sometimes he rolls, sometims I roll. 

Q: When are you planning to get married?

A: Maybe next year. 

Q: Anything funny to share in the iG team? 

A: Op really talks a LOT. He bluffs a lot after winning, then Q and I would fight him (in dota). OP is mechanically strong, but this young guy sometimes does things makes us old folks baffle. He would pretend his hero to be the illusion to hit tower and feed; Selling arcane boots when he actually want to dissemble arcane boots for bloodstone; If I want to make apology to the fans I usually use OPs weibo account to post; XXS is the pillar of our team, when we were playing great we call him fork brother (X in chinese also can be pronounced as the word for fork), when we underperform we call him forklift. These nicknames are all made up by OP. Q is another interesting guy, hes bit fat so hes determined to loose weight. He would run for half an hour after our scrims, then order a huge dinner to compensate his efforts. 

Q: What does the 10 yuan per bottle means in your practice room?

A: I BOUGHT THOSE WATER, THEN THEY ALL TAKE LIKE WHATEVER, SO I HAVE TO WRITE THIS DOWN. 

Q: What would you do after retire?

A: Probably will stay in the scene, maybe get Rotk to cast together. 

Q: Any words for the fans?

A: Thank everyone for their care  and support, I hope you can turn your attention to my games, visit my stream if you have time. 

Q: Any words for the flamers?

A: If flaming me can make you happy, its not bad.

Dota 2 27th March Patch  Content Analysis|cyborgmatt.com||article
In defense of Viper and his wings.|self.DotA2|~As most people can notice, Viper's wings appear to be facing the wrong direction, as they sweep forward, rather than backwards. As we all know it to be, all wings; birds, bats, insects, etc. face backwards. This allows them to easily maneuver in the air, and allows for simple, effective lift. This is also seen in Dota, where Jakiro, Winter Wyvern, Batrider, and such all have the characteristic back-swept wings. Viper easily sticks out as some awkward mistake, amongst the other fliers.

But here's the thing, the design of Viper's unique wings could easily be the result of evolutionary adaptation. What we know of Viper is that he is a Netherdrake. The species was sealed off for millions of years in the luminous subterranean caverns of the Nether Reaches. Caves are likely to curve at random points, taper off, and contain various rock formations. They also may have low, wide ceilings, as well as tall, thin passages.

Various noted advantages of a forward-swept wing involve better maneuverability in various circumstances. The two main points are allowing for a much higher angle of attack, and being more controllable at low or supersonic speeds. With forward wings, craft are able to easily maintain 65 angles without stalling. A second significant advantage is that the shape of the wings reduces drag by moving air towards the center of the unit. The forward wings also shift the center of gravity, allowing huge G shifts in short periods of time.

So how does this help a Netherdrake such as Viper? The various maneuverability bonuses are incredibly useful when flying about a cave. Standard wings require much more space to pull off evasive maneuvers, such as loops, rolls, and various turns. This also assists in projecting his toxins, which are incredibly potent for hunting prey.  Able to change directions very easily, he can force prey, and indeed any potential predator into a disastrous trajectory, avoidable only with forward-swept wings. 

More clues exist when examining Viper's head and facial structure. Viper's jaw is structured in such a way that his lower jaw projects outwards past his upper jaw. Upon slamming his jaw shut, it is more likely to catch upon the underside of the object. As a result, he is easily able to chase a prey in ascent, and grasp it in his mouth. Also look at his eye orientation. His head slants back, and on each side are a pairs of eyes. One pair is forward facing, while the other is angled on the side somewhat upwards. Using the pair in conjunction, Viper is able to watch the air above him, while also observing the terrain in front of him. All of these points lead to Viper being a low-flying hunter, which approaches prey from below.

Also note the claws adorning the front of Viper's wings. Viper, with his flat body shape, can easily approach a foe from below and rip at their wings with such claws. Such a design would be unfeasible on a standard wing. One must also consider that Viper lacks any lower limbs. Creatures such as Jakiro and Winter Wyvern are capable of walking when not in flight. As flight is Viper's sole mode of locomotion, the reduced drag created by the forward-swept wings reduces the amount of energy needed to maintain flight.

All of these characteristics are thus potentially very useful in the environment the Netherdrakes evolved in. The unique wing shape is further supported in his lore. It is said their cave was sealed away from the outside for millions of years. This would isolate the Netherdrakes from any other external species, allowing this unique trait to arise in Viper's population. He is a specialized hunter, shaped by millions of years of evolution into a top subterranean killer. 

______________________

tl;dr: Viper's wings are specially formed to give him an edge in aerial combat, despite how strange they may look. 

P.S. Valve, please go back and touch-up Viper's model, evolution really is not an excuse for low-quality modelling. The textures, of course, should be updated as well. Thanks.~|article

6.82 Comeback mechanic is awesome, but for whom?|self.DotA2|~Some things i'm noticing after the patch, and the ensuing storm on this sub:

* It's silly to say that you "earned a comeback" through "better play & decision-making" when there is a comeback mechanic specifically designed to allow you to have a chance to get back in the game no matter what happens. 

* This caters to the bad players that didn't know *what they did in the early game had consequences later.*  Is it fair for them to not give a shit about early game just because "cumback mechanic"? The bounty change just perpetuates what bad players did before, which was not care that *misplays/feeding could possibly lead to a struggle in the late game.*

* You don't deserve a comeback just because you kill off a carry who's been feeding off your mistakes throughout the game

* There's an ugly trend on this sub where people pat themselves on the back, after feeding the enemy a large advantage and then thinking they **deserve cumback** because of one kill on a streaking player. 

* Current trench mentality: "They made one mistake and I'm finally able to kill them them! That should make up for all the other mistakes I made all game!"


I'll brave the downvotes, but I feel there's an influx of new players and vocal-majority trench players passing off this mechanic that caters to them as them "deserving these new cumback wins."
