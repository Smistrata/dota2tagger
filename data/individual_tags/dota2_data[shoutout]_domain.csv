The Manila Major: A thank you to the community|self.DotA2|~Hello everyone,

After months of planning, designing, building and tinkering, The Manila Major has reached its conclusion.

We've had 8 days filled with amazing moments. The close calls, incredible comebacks, flawless executions and flat out brawls showed us that Dota 2 is in a very good place right now.

We were fortunate enough to have an incredible crowd here in the Mall of Asia Arena, as well as some very vocal fans online that pointed out the things we could improve on.

Thank you Valve for trusting us to host an event worthy of your expectations. We had a blast here in Manila and we hope everyone enjoyed The Manila Major as much as we did making it.~|shout esports

Valve Event advertising - THANKS GABE|self.DotA2|~First of all thank you Gabe. 
Thank you for keeping the advertising out of Valve sponsored events.  I know that must have been a hard decision.  In my mind I can see the decision polarize your team but my god it is THE BEST way to go. 

You have no idea how great it is to be able to watch TI6 without constant advertisements.  To be able to switch streams without twitch advertisements.  To be able to watch highlights on YouTube without watching a 30 second commercial. 

To not have to hear the casters say Purge what are the Monster Energy statistics on that game 

Thank you for not charging for this  for not making Valve events a Pay-Per-View | MAIN EVENT.  
And thank you for giving us hats to pay for the privilege of having an advertisement free event  wow.
You may not hear it enough from fans but this means the world to me.  Corporate sponsors distract and cheapen sporting events.  
Thank you Valve
Thank you Gabe

Came from /r/all - Never watched or played DOTA2 before - That was some Olympics-level entertainment...|self.DotA2|~I've heard about dota2 and LoL but I've never played either.  I'm 30 years old and haven't played a serious game since WoW's Lich King expansion.  
The most hardcore game I play these days is Clash Royale on iOS lol

Anyway, I stumbled into that championship tonight via front page and this video linked on the side was INCREDIBLY helpful: [First Timer's Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_L4Q_FRcyY)

Even though I only discovered the video to help me understand what I was watching mid-way through game 2, I had a **blast** watching and will definitely watch more in the future.

COOL STUFF!
idk \\\_()_/ 

*Big takeaways (maybe y'all will find these fun?)*:  
- Twitch chat is God awful.  
- I think people hate Void? Whatever that is? OP? idk  
- I basically just spent the whole time watching health bars at the top of the screen, rather than the action in the middle.  It was giving me seizures and I didn't understand the chaos anyway lol  
- THE FANS ARE NUTS!  
- Lastly, you have something like 100+ characters? wtf is wrong with all of you that you subject yourselves to this kind of chaos?  I can't imagine trying to learn the ins and outs to be prepared to fight against them all.  

**tl;dr**: Came from /r/all, watched a good newbies guide to watching dota2, had shittons of fun.

*Edit*: Dang and I wake up to 2.4k upDOTAs, front page of your sub, and a ton of return love.  Thanks, y'all!~|shout esports

Appreciation post for Kaci Aitchison|self.DotA2|~I personally believe such a post should be here, because Kaci Aitchison has been absolutely fantastic to watch over the past few TI's. I'll try touching on some of the things she has been doing for the viewers and fans, alike. 


From being an unknown backstage host without any prior knowledge of the game,  due to which she got trolled by all the casters (especially Iceiceice) in her first gig, to being one of the most hyped up, cheerful and pleasent personalities of the International talent, Kaci has definitely left a mark on the Dota2 community. 


By no means am I implying that the other talent has not been outstanding, but this TI I realized  that she has been a DotA outsider who gave up a great chunk of herself to assimilate into this community, all the while being excellent at the way she has handled her interactions with pro players, the crowd and the fans.


I can't begin to imagine how tough backstage hosting would have been at this year's International, given she has been pregnant for more than a few weeks and she literally used that fact to make people laugh numerous times, which is a wonderful and heartwarming thing.

Kaci, if you ever read this, I really wanted to give a shout out to all your contributions and how terrific you have been over the years, and I believe the DotA community feels the same way. I wish you the best of health in the coming years, and hope I somehow get a chance to meet you in person. You are an absolutely wonderful personality to watch :).~|shout esports
The Boston Major: A thank you to the community|self.DotA2|~Hello everyone,

After an incredible six day journey, The Boston Major has come to an end. We witnessed epic teamfights, outstanding solo plays, insane team coordinations and almost sacrificed ODPixel and our hearts on the altar of the 3rd game of the Grand Final.

Post-Manila, the expectations for the next Major were sky-high and the pressure to deliver higher than ever. There were some missteps along the way, but we learned a lot in the process and we're grateful for the support and feedback we have received during the event.

So thank you Boston for having us and thank you Valve for trusting us again.

We hope everyone enjoyed the show and we'll see you again in April 2017 in beautiful Kyiv (Kiev).~|shout esports

Dota 2 has the best sound design of any video game ever made|self.DotA2|~I want to bake a cake and give gifts to the sound engineers who work on Dota. Can someone help me find out who they are? Do they still work at Valve? If so, I could just send gifts to the Valve office addressed to "Aural Geniuses" and I'm sure they'd figure it out...

Listen to some of hlgf's amazing Dota 2 sound effect remixes while I rave. [Witch Doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZYgqBp1gI), [Cogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEX0s6weKA0), [Enchantress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80pBvl_gPI4) 

&nbsp;

As a fogie way too old for this subreddit, I have played thousands of video games. I cannot name a single game that comes remotely close to Dota's calibre of sound design. It is in a class of its own.

Almost every interaction has a unique, distinguishable, and memorable sound effect. You can listen to a teamfight like a radio and identify every hero involved. You can use the clear sounds of enemy spells to mentally mark them as on cooldown. You can use the clear sound of your ally Io's spells to identify when they are attempting to relocate-grief you into the enemy fountain, allowing you to quickly -disablehelp.

Other games have homogenous sound effects for movement, attacks, spells. In Dota the scant few homogenous sound effects are *jarring* when they occur because the user expects uniqueness. For example: Have you ever flinched when your ally Dazzle walked by, thinking it was an enemy Pudge? The jingle of the chains is the same. That we even notice this "bug" is a testament to the value of Dota's sound.

When Iron Talon was first released on the test client, it went through three iterations of its sound effect before going live. Items like Buriza which previously had no unique on-hit sound effect have had them added in. What game company *does* that?

The product director who set the principle of requiring unique and melodious sound effects for each interaction is a genius. Who is responsible for this glory? Is it Icefrog himself?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I will now proceed to list sound effects which you will subvocalize whether you like it or not.


* Clarity Potion
* Unstable Concoction
* Darkness
* Omni's hammer autoattack sound (hint from Icefrog to only play him as a carry)
* Sniper's memetic voice
* Tower autoattack
* A melee creep scraping its shortsword on your 1k MMR flesh
* Sanity's Eclipse
* Refraction blocking a damage instance
* Bristleback procing 322 simultaneous Quillspray instances due to a damage loop bug
* Mango
* Mask of Madness
* Timbersaw whiffing Timberchain ^"They're ^gonna ^get ^me"
* Requiem of Souls
* Axe's Culling Blade (*We've recently taken action against one or more players you've previously reported for bad conduct. You have received an additional report submission to use. Thanks for your help in making the Dota 2 community a friendlier place.*)
* The "Three, Two, One" Respawn Hymn
* Meep Mop

20 Billion Trees? Maybe this is about raising awareness|self.DotA2|~According to [this](http://time.com/4019277/trees-humans-deforestation/) article, we cut down about 15 billion trees every year (someone already posted it 1-2 days ago). There are somewhat 400 billion trees on our planet according to recent estimates.

Maybe not intended, but looking at this from an environmental perspective, the current tree challenge actually shows how much 20 billion is. It's a huge number! And yet, we as humans almost are able to cut down 15 billion trees a year. That's a huge ass pile of trees.

So, while enjoying the virtual deforestation, maybe spend a few minutes a day and try to think about how you could actually lower the number of trees cut per year.

Maybe you want to support financially, helping out great projects that support reafforestation or help save certain regions on this planet from overexploitation or even illegal depletion.

Maybe you want to support this cause by looking at your everyday consumption of paper-based things like packaging, printing paper, etc.

Maybe you want to contribute by simply raising awareness. 

**Here is my challenge for you**: as a species with common interest in survival and conservation of wildlife, respectively nature itself: help to cut down less than 15 billion trees per year.

Save the trees, save lives!

Make the world great again!

The Kiev Major - A thank you to the community|self.DotA2|~Hello everyone,


The Kiev Major has concluded, with yet another trophy is in the bag for OG. Anybody start to see a pattern here?


Going into the event, we knew that this was going to be the most challenging one that we've done on this scale, mainly due to the fact that, for the first time, our production team was going to be split between Kiev and Bucharest.


And while some of the things that we were expecting to go wrong actually didn't, the technical side ended up rougher around the edges than we would have liked.


That said, one of the things that **did** go according to plan were the Mischiefs at the Major segments. The concept behind them was to have enough content so we wouldn't have any breaks whatsoever during the main event.


Which is why the Kiev Major has become the first in history with no breaks during the main event. That's over **60 hours** of broadcast over just **four days**.


Speaking of which... what the hell was up with those series? Best of 3s for all their money's worth right from the group stage, 60+ minutes games... seriously?!?


After day two, the callouts in the production room devolved into "*Yo, let's get ready with the cameras, they're pushing high ground! / What's the in-game timer? / 28:15 / GTFO of this channel, call me again when we're at around the 55 minute mark*". 


And sure enough, 30 minutes later we were getting ready for the end of the game. Nostradamus would have been proud.


Not that we complain. If long broadcast days are the price we have to pay for series like Secret or EG vs SG e-sports and this Grand Final, so be it. We can take the heat.


So thank you for being patient with us, for the support and the dedication to follow the event all the way through the late hours of the night, both in the arena and online.


You're the reason we do what we do.~|shout esports

Torte De Lini Appreciation Thread|self.DotA2|~The highly anticipated In-Client Hero Build system is almost upon us and it is a feature that we have been sorely missing as a community for a long time. 

In the dark and harrowing times where making Hero Builds for the current patch was hard and tedious we had one particular individual who has led us through the years. A shining beacon of knowledge in the guide tabs, a man who has dedicated so much of his time in order to bring us up to date hero builds every patch as the seasons have come and gone. Yes, I am referring to the one and only /u/TorteDeLini.

Torte has been making hero builds for years that have helped guide players item choices and to formulate how a hero is played with his helpful notes on the items and skills. He has even participated at the recent TI7 and was in charge of the Newcomers Stream that helped to foster new interest in our game and community.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank /u/TorteDeLini for his reliability and his dedication in making hero builds every single major patch for the past few years. He has done so much for our new players and even experienced ones alike and now with the coming update to the Hero Build system we will probably see a rise in many different builds once more.

Ive read the patch notes and I really love the changes that are coming and I am also excited for the professional Dota matches that are to follow.

The future looks bright for this community! Even brighter than KoTLs Blinding Light

An icefrog apriciation thread|self.DotA2|~I only started playing dota about a year and half ago, but in the last few days i went digging into the history of dota, and i would like to thank icefrog a TON.

When pendragon and guinsoo left DotA-allstars to work on LoL, Icefrog stayed, and managed the game with Neichus, and a bit later alone for about 5 years, even thought he couldve PROBABLY gone to work on LoL. After pendragon closed the Original dotaallstars site down, icefrog created a new site (playdota) for the people playing dota, so he can continue taking ideas and feedback from the community. There were a LOT of attemps to get icefrog to stop working on dota so LoL would have a monopoly, but he didnt give up on the game.

All in all, i would like to thank and appriciate icefrog for all the dedication he has given dota and dota 2 in the last decade, and cannot wait for his future work! This game, and the work put into it, definetly deserves to be where it is right now!~|shout

Daily reminder that Dota 2 still is the commercial game with the most fair monetisation model in the world.|self.DotA2|~There is literally no other f2p game at the moment which doesn't sell any kind of ingame advantage. Dota is the only game that can be played at any level with 0 money investment. Even Path Of Exile which I consider very fair has the option of buying extra stash tabs with real money.

Nowadays it's normal even for buy to play / pay to play games to have microtransactions, many of them can have effect on gameplay.

I had only vaguely heard of Epicenter leading up to its start, and it has far exceeded my expectations and actually become one of my favorite tournaments of the year so far.

Keep up the great work!~|shout esports

TI5 - Anyone else notice the lack of commercials? I think it has gone unrecognized, and IMO i am happy they are not around.|self.DotA2|~For everyone complaining about valve and just taking our money. I am sure they could have a great opportunity to put out mad amounts of commercials and in between sponsors. But they haven't. The content is all there and they are just talking about dota. I am sure this is a luxury of having a major tournament put on by a massive corp. 

Please note: This is nothing against tournaments that do have commercials or "words from our sponsors" moments. Since they most likely require the revenue to put on the event. And it most likely isn't feasible to put on an event without support from sponsors. 

Just a thought. So in a way, props to valve. ~|shout
Dear people of Manila|self.DotA2|~I traveled from Adelaide South Australia and have spent the last 10 days in Manila attending the major for the last 6 of those days. You have been so welcoming so nice and so fucking hype it's unbelievable.

 I had people stop me in the street and ask if I was here for DOTA and when I said yes they would talk to me about favorite heroes, mmr and best teams. When done talking about DOTA you would then tell me all the cool tourist things to do and where to eat.

So from the bottom of my heart thanks for 10 of my best days I hope you get another major next year because I'll definitely come back.~|shout esports

Fear Appreciation Thread|self.DotA2|~It seems fairly clear the Old Man of DotA is retiring after the 'Legacy' tweet. 1x Aegis, 2x 3rd, will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest players of all time for consistency and dedication. Show some love for the living legend. 

Edit: ~~~~May take the thread down soon, as Charlie has tweeted 'Just fucking wait'. May just be that EG the Org disbanded and Zai/Fear left due to the team no longer having that name. Shall wait and see.~~~~

Yeah I think it's real, as no personalities or Fear himself have said anything otherwise. GL Fear BibleThump

Thank you to Valve and the Make-A-Wish foundation|self.DotA2|~Hello /r/dota2.  I'm a 17 year old Dota enthusiast from central Missouri, USA.

In November 2013, I was diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma on my left hip. For those of you who don't know, that's cancer. That completely freaked out my family and I and we did not know how to react. That was the start of  25 doses of radiation, seven multiple day hospital stays for chemotherapy and two major surgeries. As of a month ago, I'm officially done with treatment and now waiting for my hair and eyebrows to grow back.  

It's taken a long time but it has been a lot easier with all the support from my friends, family and people I don't know who have heard my story and wanted to help. People brought me gifts, provided meals for my family, and donated items like a new laptop to keep me from being bored in the hospital. My oncologist, being the great guy that he is, referred me to the Make-A-Wish Foundation and I applied for a wish. The Wish Granters (yes that's what they're called) granted me my wish to go to the International.

It was great that Valve helped out by donating passes for my brother and I to go to all 4 days of the tournament in KeyArena. I wanted to post this to publicly thank Valve and the Make-A-Wish Foundation for giving our family a great way to celebrate the end of my treatment and hopefully my cancer. If you see me at TI4, (I'm the bald kid with no eyebrows) come say hi.

**tl:dr** I had cancer, Valve and Make-A-Wish let me go to TI4 for free.

**EDIT:** I would really like to thank xCesme for giving me a Dagon for Nyx Assassin. What a nice gesture.~|shout

His 80-30 record as Magnus is easily best all-time on the hero (Dendi, 71-34).

N0tail's 103 different heroes played in competitive Dota 2 is 2nd only to Fear (104) and tied with Kuro.

This Summit feels like a love letter to the community.|self.DotA2|~I just wanted to write about how impressed I've been by this tournament. Even as a European who has only been able to watch about half of the streams live, I feel like I've seen about three EU hubs' worth of dank memes and quality Dota.


The chemistry of the panelists has been incredible. From Jack to Lacoste, from Charlie to Grandgrant, from the Salt Lord to the Swindlemelonzz celebrity phone-in special, everyone's been great value. It's always a joy to see a more relaxed atmosphere in which people we know from so many  professional events hanging out.


And the skits - Jesus Christ. Hotbid, everyone, take a bow.


The whole thing just feels like a collection of incredibly smart, passionate and talented individuals - not least the players - coming together to celebrate the game and the people who play it.


I guess you could also say that the Summits of past years have been the same. But in the context of the game's mooted decline, much discussed on here lately, and BTS beginning to branch out into other, newer e-sports scenes, it seems all the more poignant.


For what it's worth, I've always felt like reports of the death of Dota 2 have been greatly exaggerated. I'm surprised by the strength of opinions that seem to run hot on this subreddit. It seems like every other thread has a string of upvoted posts declaring Valve a greedy and lazy developer, uninterested in the game beyond its ability to render them profit. 


Conversely, in every *other* other thread the prevailing opinion will be that they're the best custodian Dota could have hoped for, in contrast to companies such as Blizzard and Riot, who would have been *even more* greedy, lazy and profit-obsessed. 


Surely the answer lies somewhere in the middle. Valve have done a lot of good things for the game. They've carried it a long way. In the pub scene, Dota is still a joy to play. Even after 6.88, widely hailed at the time as the best that game's ever been, improvements have been made. Shrines, backpacks, talents and even Monkey King have all added something new and exciting to the mix, even if it took a while to get them to a place where they were considered strictly enhancements.


In the professional scene, people who accuse Valve of smothering the scene with too many majors and an over-reliance a small number of production companies are quick to forget the dire days of the Shanghai major. In a lot of ways that choice was made for Valve by the failures of Perfect World to hold up their end of the 'CS:GO model'.


But it's clear they've made some mistakes along the way. When we moved from the old client to Reborn, quite a lot of features fell by the wayside. Third party compendiums, crowd-funded prize pools and creator-friendly workshop policies are just some of the problems that Valve seem to have pushed to one side and forgotten about. 


I imagine that because freelancers and third party orgs aren't strolling into Volvo headquarters in Bellevue every weekday, their problems don't seem as immediate to Valve employees as the things they talk to each other about. But that doesn't mean those problems can be safely ignored.


I'm neither smart nor clued-in enough to know all the ins-and-outs of what's going on. But third parties have clearly been alienated by some of the decisions Valve have made and the breakdown in communication that has followed.


Yet in spite of this BTS go ahead and put together what, for my money at least, is one of the greatest events in the history of professional Dota.


I guess I'm writing this because I desperately want Valve to wake up and realise the value that these people are contributing to the scene surrounding the game - and how much they deserve to be rewarded, and encouraged to continue. 


Workshop artists, casters, broadcasters, observers, tournament organisers, hell, even Slacks - beyond the core of the game, which is obviously fundamental, it's the people around it and the work that they do that grows a scene and sustains it. 


It's almost like Valve has the perfect gf/bf: supportive, dedicated, funny... but because they're so damn busy all the time they've lost sight of what's important, and how much they're getting out of the relationship. I'm not sure they realise how damaging it would be to let all this slip through their hands.


Or maybe this is all way off. It's late, I've had three glasses of wine, and the heat is making it feel like six. All I know is that I've never felt about a game quite the way I feel about Dota, and watching this tournament makes me feel like there's a group of incredibly awesome people who feel the same way. Valve shouldn't take that for granted.

TL;DR: Kappa Keepo 123~|shout esports
KuroKy appreciation Thread|self.DotA2|~before puppey got exposed , a lot of people were flaming kuro

after the leaked messages from puppey , more people flamed kky for trying to convince people that puppey is the issue , no one listen to him , in the leaked messages i saw 1437 dick sucking puppey so much even tho he knew puppey was wrong

puppey even said "gonna beat that little faggot if i see him" 

but kuro never flamed anyone , after rtz and envy flamed him he didnt come to twitter to smack talk or talk shit about rtz , only praised rtz  ,envy called him stupid on twitter now envy said that he regrets trash talking kuro. 

 he started his own team from the bottom , and turned that team to a tier1 team even tho some of the players were new to the pro scene

i think kuro is one the nicest guys in the scene and i hope everyone had attitude like him , he's been in the scene for a very long time (almost as long as puppey) and he deserve to get appreciation 

thank you kuro even tho if you never see this

The Bucharest Major at its end - A thank you to the community|self.DotA2|~Hello everybody,

While we are still loading up the production PCs and rolling up cables like the aspiring pros we are, we wanted to take a moment to thank the community, the talent, the teams and everybody else involved that helped make The Bucharest Major come to life. 

For this event, our first Major since the inception of the DPC, we wanted to go back to the basics. The focus of the event would be on starting the matches on time and moving seamlessly through the different series. While this may mean we had to make some compromises, the results speak for themselves. 

The Bucharest Major wasnt perfect by any means. There are lots of things we still need to work on, but the fact that we had almost NO technical pauses for the entire event and that we finished ahead of schedule rather than behind it on most days gives us a sense of accomplishment. 

We did try some new things. For a substantial part of our crew this was their first esports tournament. And we believe all things considered, they performed exceptionally. 

We worked with new talent that had never crossed our studios carpeted no-shoes-allowed floors. It is in part because we were so impressed with their skill and professionalism that we wanted the BO5 finale to include all of them. 

Thank you to the new friends we made and the original friends that always had our back. Heres looking at you Redeye. And thank you to the friends that made us laugh, but did so in a professional manner while the cameras were rolling. I mean of course, Slacks and Maly. 

We are also grateful to our friends at Imba for not only being our co-organizers but also for transmitting our work to an audience that is hungry for quality games and quality production. We cant forget how much help we received from partners and sponsors Twitch, Telekom Romania, HyperX, Red Bull, SecretLab and Omen by HP.

And of course thank you to the teams who trusted us to uphold a certain standard of competition and hospitality. We hope we didnt disappoint. 

Lastly, thank you to the Dota community. While you may be a diverse, outspoken bunch, we know that whatever comes out of your mouths and keyboards is first spurned by a love of the game and not maliciousness of spirit. We hope our Bucharest Major helped you love Dota a tiny bit more than you did before it. 

That is or should be the real objective of any organizer. 

And while I have you here... check out the [PGL Bucharest Major Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZtjBRS_cwg). :)

Dear Artour B.,|self.DotA2|~Hey man, what an outstanding performance this TI. Arguably a top performer throughout the group stages and one game that was hard fought. Despite all the criticisum you've received and will yet to, you are still an inspiration not to hundreds, or thousands, but hundreds of thousands. Such myself, an older (28) and later comer to Dota(2) and the competive scene. 

Like many greats, winning did not come easy. It takes failing to be a champion, and many can tell you the failure can only fuel the fire. Your time will come, and i'm sure of it as long as you continue to keep your head up. You inspire many such as myself to continually learn the game and enjoy its entirety. 

Your streams were great too, not only from your playmaking but from the music and vibe as well, as I enjoy the same genre. Hope you get back on again some day. If youre ever back in the IE (BTS) hit me up! Drinks on me.

Whatever you choose to do, please continue to inspire the many people you do and chase your dreams. Wherever you are i'll always root for you to bring it all home one day. Best of luck to you and your future endeavors.

EPICENTER XL: you did it, Reddit!|self.DotA2|~It's probably a bit late for this as you've already covered each and every aspect of the event we've just hosted. Nevertheless I still want to say a few words.

This has been by far the most difficult event in my esports life. We faced all possible kind of issues along those insane 10 days and I am extremaly grateful to all the teams and all the talents for their patience and understanding. 

Paul has taught us a lot about the small production bits that help make the show more enjoyable to watch. Kyle proved himself as a great panelist. Cap rocked it in his shorts while barely able to walk. Bulldog turned out to be not just a meme master, but a Major Finals caster able to work in front of an almost 10k live audience speaking a completely different language. Grant and Breaky, Pidgeon and Bkop, Nomad and Mofarah, they all brought something new to the Major scene (oh my word) and I really wish we will see them more in the next season. GoDz and ODPixel, who seem to be around since forever, yet never cease to amaze us. I salute all of you, gentlemen!

This year we've tried to do the things differently and not all of them worked the way we expected. And our team is grateful for all the feedback you provided. It will help us improve our next events and make them even more EPIC! Tank you all!~|shoutout esports

A thank you letter to the community from the guy that made the Sven & Dazzle comic|self.DotA2|~Hi people, I'm the dude that made the [Sven and Dazzle](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6fmkg6/experienced_player_gives_helpful_advice_to/?st=j3o7y02a&sh=ef8eab44) comic. 

I just want to thank you all for the reception. I've been making comics for a short while but oh my god were you guys nice. Seriously, it was amazing. You made me feel like a super star. You made that simple comic the 4th highest post in r/dota2! 

I got so many replies and PMs. I took allot of time to answer as much as I could, at least upvote every single comment. You people really like to present yourselves as a pure salt mine but that wasn't my experience. 

The number of compliments and nice things you said was insane. I was sure to keep making comics but now I'm more pumped than ever. 

I just wanna thank you for everything, to everyone that commented and the silent majority, for enjoying my content and telling me to do more. 

You made such a commotion that I even got to talk to the creator of Extra Fabulous Comics (my fav. webcomic artist)! 

You're all 6k in my eyes. 

Cheers

PS I want this to be a pure thank you letter but there's an update on my stuff in the comments, since I know people have been asking about it

Dota's Lore in a Nutshell|self.DotA2|~So a super long time ago Elder Titan made EG.Universe and everything came into existence.  It was super chill because all of the forces of the universe existed together as one being that sort of composed everything.  Then one of the four fundamental forces decided to be a total asshole and split everything up.  This was KotL, KotL is actually the ultimate evil and bad guy of the Dota EG.Universe.  The Fundamentals got split up into four different beings.  First was KotL who decided to celebrate his freedom by going on a rampage and slaughtering Night Stalker's people.  He also is a huge pervert but gets away with it by pretending to be an alzheimers patient.  Chaos Knight was another Fundamental who dedicated his life to chasing down the batshit crazy KotL; yeah CK is actually the good guy trying to track down the insane madman.  Enigma was another Fundamental who decided to start fucking with people and grow in power while the last Fundamental, Wisp, just sorta wandered off one day.

Meanwhile a bunch of vague shit happened and our world was made by Earthshaker.  How did he do it?  Nobody knows except for ET and he's out of the meta so nobody is gonna ask him anyway.  Even Earthshaker doesn't really remember how it worked.  Tiny was born when the world was made, he was a little pebble who just sorta rolled around on the ground slowly growing up.  The world existed in peace and harmony except not really because a lot of crazy, unimportant shit happened like Lycan's dad getting shanked and Axe going hard as a motherfucker on literally everything.

Then shit got crazy and the Moon split in half.  Yeah apparently there were two Gods or something living in the moon?  Or something?  They didn't like eachother and fought endlessly,  I dunno, but the moon kinda exploded and all the pieces of the moon fell onto the planet.  The two gods or whatever were the ancients, one that was Dire and one that was Radiant.  When the pieces all fell to earth they became the Ancients that people defend.  Getting too close to one of the shards makes you go bananas and convince yourself that you're in an endless war just like the two gods in the moon were and you turn into a creep.

Slark snatched a magic chalice from under Naga's nose and Naga got exiled because of it while Kunkka got the Gem of True Sight from the evil Kraken god Maelrawn.  Kunkka ran away but Maelrawn sent Tidehunter after the Kunk-ster and Tidehunter blew up his ship.  Kunkka is probably a ghost now but who fucking knows, anyway the two are at eachother's throats forever now.

Rubick and Invoker knew eachother, or maybe not, but Rubick knew OF Invoker, or something.  Invoker used to be called the Arsenal Magus and everyone thought he was top shit so a bunch of cultists did some selective breeding eugenics to try and make another Invoker, only they ended up making Silencer instead who told them to shut the fuck up.  Invoker also knew Undying back when he was alive, but Undying is now a zombie who serves the Dead God, which sent its army to kill all of Antimage's people.  Antimage somehow blamed this on magic instead of zombies, even though Antimage is the biggest hypocrite in all of Dota since he uses fucking Blink as his main tool.

Some Goddess somewhere named Nyctasha had a really fucking bad dream about Faceless Void and it came to life as Bane and killed her, Outworld Devourer came to earth to warn us about some REALLY BAD SHIT that's coming from outside the galaxy but nobody seems to listen, Tusk and Bristleback had fisticuffs in a bar, and a bunch of other wacky shit took place.

Now people are basically fighting eachother because they were driven crazy by the ancients and transformed into creep armies to try and kill eachother, while the heroes are just people who have enough Purity of Will to not go batshit crazy.

But none of this fucking matters, because it's a videogame.  And no, I'm not saying that to be a smartass.  It's literally a videogame.  The Dota universe takes place in a computer program, with the inhabitants unaware that they're just programs.  The only one who knows is Leshrac, who figured it out by peering into the heart of creation and discovering that everything he's doing is nothing more than participating in a game called Defense of the Ancients.  And it really, really, really makes him sad.~|shout esports

Thanks for the early patch release|self.DotA2|~Hey valve, 

I tried sending you an email, not sure if it went to the right place, so here is a message about your early release of the new patch. 

To a lot of people, releasing a patch one day or even an hour early is just a nice thing that makes their day slightly better and gets them off the edge of their toilet and back into their gaming computer for a fun night. For me, this patch release was different. My mother suffered an aneurysm into a stage 5 bleed on October 30th. She hung on until about 8AM on October 31st after I spent the whole night with my family literally watching her die. 

Still in shock, I finally got home and crashed after being the last bastion of wakefulness my family had, keeping things organized and held down so when they woke up, she would be peacefully breathing and they would be somewhat rested. 

When I finally got to my computer to sit down and chat with my best friend, who refused to play dota til the new patch came out, I said "please play some dota with me. I need to take an emotional and mental break from this. I don't give a shit new patch or not, lets just play." So I opened up my Dota client and, while I was gone, it had downloaded and installed the patch. I was shocked to see two new heroes to play and some neat new items to fiddle with (I had read the patch notes before so I kinda new they were coming just not that day.)

It didn't fill the void I now have, it didn't stop the crying but what it did do is give me a very pleasant surprise, one day early and on the day I watched my mother pass away, to distract me for a few hours. I know most people probably won't care and I don't really care if you upvote or don't, I just want someone at valve to know that them releasing the patch one day early made a positive impact in someones life, no matter how small in the grand scheme of that day it was. 

Thanks.

Can we all really appreciate Icefrog and Valve for the current patch?|self.DotA2|~I personally found TI5 matches really boring due to the small hero pool in the meta and the farming heavy strategies.

This patch has been incredible. We've seen everything from 5 man deathball to 10 man team wipes, thrilling base races, unbelievable comebacks, slippery rat strategies, tense extended roshan fights, huge number of viable heroes in the meta, more blood shed in a match than the entirety of game of thrones--sometimes with whole team fights starting and ending before the creeps have spawned, matches that flip back and forth throughout, games that showcase and reward both individual skill and teamwork--allowing both cores and supports to shine, nail biting jukes and blink-and-you-miss-it surprise kills, it has been wonderful to both watch and play dota.

Dota will keep changing and getting better, but right now, we're in a super sweet spot, and I couldn't be more excited for TI6.

We give you a lot of crap Volvo, but we really do love what you've done with this game. Sometimes it's difficult to hear the lone voice of praise amidst the Tsunami of criticism, but I hope you see this, and know that all of us really appreciate your passion and dedication to Dota, and to us.~|shout
Can we have Moonduck organizing more tournaments/events?|self.DotA2|First Midas Mode, and now CD 4.0. Both have been fucking awesome! The light-heartedness of these tournaments make it really enjoyable to watch and I sincerely hope we get to see more from them.|shoutout esports
Midas Mode is exactly the type of show I hoped to see when Moonduck announced founding of the studio|self.DotA2|~When the announcement came in 2015, I couldn't have been more excited about who is involved in Moonduck and what their "mission statement" as a studio was. Then, when they announced Midas Mode earlier this year, I thought "yes! finally, this is it!" and I'm glad to see I was right.

While Elimination Mode was really fun to watch and a (very clear) glimpse into what the studio is about, Midas Mode just knocks it out of the park. The idea and realisation of the game mode aside, everything else around it has been absolutely on point as well. The people, the dynamics between them, and the overall vibe coming out of that. Even the "we barely know what we're doing, but let's go!" approach to production.

The whole thing is just oozing charm and genuine personality. I love it. (also Trent has become my favourite dota-Canadian next to Arteezy)

It's so awesome to see the result of Moonduck's hard work over the last two years. And with Captain's Draft becoming an actual LAN (and Minor) in its fourth iteration, I can't wait to see what's next for them.~|shoutout esports
SyndereN really is the perfect english dota caster|self.DotA2|~He has a good english voice, he can play-by-play, he's super knowledgeble in analysis, he not biased to any teams, he never trashtalks or says stuff like "this draft is so bad, i dont know how team x is gonna win" minute 1, he always takes it as both teams are not bad and really are trying to play/draft their best.

He says that he still wants to try play competitive but imo he is THE BEST caster of the scene and I think the community would miss him dearly if he stopped casting for some time.

He reminds me a lot about Anders from CS:GO, who is also danish. 

God this country is producing good english casters.~|shout esports

* We wanted a client pop-up when the game got an update. We got it.

* We wanted parties of 5 to be able to select captain in ranked captains mode. We got it.

* We wanted bans in ranked all pick. We got it.

* Many bugs that have popped up over the course of the last few weeks such as CM aura not working. Fixed(mostly).

It's super motivating for us to see so many positive comments from an audience I'm a part of. As a long time DotA fan I always felt like our music would fit events like these perfectly so I'm super happy a lot of people feel the same way, and the artists on the label are all very stoked to see their music being such a great fit for an event like this as well. 

&nbsp;

Also happy to be able to sponsor / support an event with a format like this, I always loved The Summit as a concept cause it's casual and personal which makes it great to watch and also makes for exciting games.

&nbsp;

In case anyone's wondering, you can use [this link](http://chillhop.com/summitbeats) to find our music on any platform (YouTube / Spotify / Vinyl etc etc). Thanks again and hopefully we can support more of these events as I honestly feel like these Summits are my favorite kind of tournament being so casual / personal, and we're honored to be a part of it.

SG Esports Appreciation Post|self.DotA2|Let's show them some love. It's not easy going against so many Tier  1 teams. Hats off to the pioneers of South American Dota. It took SEA teams a long time to get the recognition they deserve and now it's South America's turn. |shout esports

I want to say this was an amazing tournament, well done ESl.|self.DotA2|I thoroughly enjoyed this tournament, it had high quality entertainment, higher quality games, an entertaining host and an amazing story for Wings gaming!|shout esports
Volvo is #1 for listening to community feedback|self.DotA2|~I was reading through ongamer's run through of the recent patch, and in addition to the quick fixing of Crystal Maiden's Immortal, they also seemed to deal with:

- The Daily Hero challenge now uses a 22 hour timer instead of the previous 24 hours.

- The team/player section will now display a tick on the players who you have stamped into your Compendium via the player card system.

- The armoury icon for the Storm Spirit hat made by Anuxi has been updated to match the new Storm Spirit model.

Thank you PGL for the uninterrupted flow of matches!|self.DotA2|~One of the few tournaments that is holding the matches as per, or even before the scheduled start without any delays and issues. This is greatly helpful to me as a working guy to maintain my schedule and plan the matches I want to see accordingly. It boggles my mind how so many tournaments still don't respect the value of time. Thank you PGL!!

And thanks for having it on twitch :)~|shoutout esports
Congratulations to the winners of The Summit 3|self.DotA2|~... TI4?

Well played to both teams.

Secret take it 3-1 against EG.~|shout esports
Props to Mercedes for the new advert|self.DotA2|~I think most agree that the Mercedes advert for ESL Hamburg was... well... a bit "out of place" and didn't really understand it's target audience. (*It sparked some top notch memes though!*)

This time around however, Mercedes listened to the criticism and created something more fitting, which I admire.


Although no one likes advertisement, it's a vital part of any entertainment business today and the E-sports scene needs big sponsors to keep growing. 

_Therefore, I want to thank Mercedes for taking E-sports seriously!_

Something I've always appreciated about Blitz's casting.|self.DotA2|When something bad happens to a team Blitz always finds a way to describe it without criticizing players too much.  If someone misses a skill shot, Blitz will say "Kunkka guesses wrong on the torrent", where other casters might just say "Kunkka misses the torrent".  It's minor but when these add up it helps make Blitz seem more impartial and more respectful.  So thanks Blitz and Synd (who is also good about this), it's refreshing to hear.|shout esports
Props to Sonneiko, only 8k+ on leaderboards that only picks supports.|self.DotA2|Went through all the dotabuff pages of people 8K+ Sonnieko seemed to be the only one that picks support only, would be awesome if we could convince him to stream. Or maybe valve should make it so we could follow players in game so whenever they play a game we could watch (if the player wanted to be public that is).|shout esports
PimpmuckL's obs is just so good|self.DotA2|Thank you very much.|shout esports
Can we take a moment an honour the production team, that there are no boring breaks and flawless transitions?|self.DotA2|~TI5 was the only one I didn't watch, so I don't know how it went last year. But let's be honest. When was the last time we saw a huge tournament that goes serveral days and has no boring downtimes, breaks, commercials, graphical placeholders that say "Upcoming match X vs Y in 30 minutes" with a looping melody in the background and so on. 

And the variety in presentation each day. Muppets, commenting from outside, Kaci of course (she's awesome as every year). AR stuff. A draft panel, a pre/after match panel, commentators, Purge, MrActionsSwags.

That is some high level production right there compared to other big esport tournaments. They don't even need to raise the bar next year. Just do the same stuff and I will still be amazed.~|shout esports

Huge shoutout to the TI5 Hub! Thanks for a crazy week of DoTA and awesomeness!|self.DotA2|~In light of the conclusion of the final qualifier, we should definitely thank everyone involved in the hub. The crazy hours, the mafia games, the late night chats with people. The schedule made it harder this year, but I had an awesome time with the stream and all the shenanigans that ensued.

Edit: snagged this timely screenshot http://imgur.com/vpXGcKC

If next year allows sing and BDN to show up, imagine them playing mafia holy fucking shit.~|shout esports

Shoutout to the team behind the Player Profile videos|self.DotA2|Honestly, the quality on them is top-notch, and makes you empathize with every single player, no matter the team. The time and work really shows in them, and I'm glad they are a part of the TI streams. Cheers whoever filmed/edited/planned them!|shout esports
A message to Bulldog and his plebs.|self.DotA2|~I am just a Scottish boy that enjoys playing the Dotes and sticks on a stream from time to time for little to no viewers. Last Friday when Bulldog ended his stream he decided to host me.

My channel was held captive by his plebs! I had a great time and there was some good laughs. My GF didn't really know what was going on but found it funny being singled out by twitch chat and logged on to join in.

So this is just a big Thank You Bulldog for making my night. <3

Artours one of the nicest guys around|self.DotA2|~EG had a huge line of fans waiting for the pictures, they took pictures with everyone for an hour and then when the time was over they started to leave the venue. Artour was the only one who stayed back a few minutes to do all the signings for everyone who asked him.   
  
Reddit loves to hate him but the guy is one of the most humble people around~|shout esports
