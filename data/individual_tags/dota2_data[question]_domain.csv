Anyone here doesn't really play dota that much but follows the pro scene like it's football?|self.DotA2|~I've been playing less and less as time went by and nowadays I play only party with a friend every several weeks top. 
still I follow tournaments, results, gossips & dramas and for me that's what dota is all about.

I wondered if there are other less active players like me that follows dota dearly.

To the people complaining that Envy is asking for donations to buy stuff for his team. I have a question.|self.DotA2|~What's wrong about that?

He's using his own fucking donation money (which he has been collecting long before this) to cover the cost for his new team now, perhaps until they actually gets sponsors and tournament prize winnings.

He could have easily kept quiet and funneled the current donations he is receiving to his team and nobody would care. The only difference now is that he's actually transparent enough to announce where the money is headed towards, and there's a problem? 

He's already asking for donations anyway, why is attaching a reason to it so bad? Would people rather he keep quiet about how he's spending the donation money? Or are people upset that he's using donation money instead of his and his teammates's money to cover cost for equipment? If that's the case what's the difference between using his own money, and money that he got through donations which is also his own money?

I'm just really perplexed why people are complaining~|question esports

It's lie a legit mystery to me how slacks is about to get 5k. I'm not flaming; I'm actually just curious. He obviously deserves it because he won enough games. But how did he do it?|self.DotA2|~He's about to get 5k. Period. He earned it. It's obviously not random. The question is rather how he gets it. 

For example, right now he's playing Disputer. He didn't ward at all early game, even though the enemy has a roaming bounty hunter (so his mid is fucked). He pulled about 4 camps in lane early game and somehow got 2 cs from doing it 4 times (like how is that even possible?). It's He let his carry die in lane and then proceeded to passive aggressively flame him for a bit. Then he went bot and feed the enemy Slark. He rushed soul ring and used it twice by minute 12. His skill bill was maxing Q, then W, then E. (He didn't have any points in E when he used his Ulti first time). He uses zero hotkeys for items. He literally clicks on the item portrait. His item build was to rush Ghost vs tide, WW, slark, bounty. Whenever he farms a lane of creeps he tends to only get 1 or 2 cs out of the wave. 

I honestly think it's cause he spams Omniknight and people don't want to be salty in front of dota celeb.

Will we ever get angelic heroes?|self.DotA2|~I just realized we have so many demons in our roster, but no angels in sight. We've got the likes of Doom, Terrorblade, Shadow Fiend, Shadow Demon, Queen of Pain, maybe even Lion (in a way) and Warlock's Golems. Then we have purgatory-ish characters like Razor and Visage. For the underworld, we have Underlord. Then we have "evil" forces of nature like Chaos Knight and Enigma.

But we don't have angels at all. We have thematically holy characters, like Omniknight and Chen, some light-based characters like Phoenix and Keeper of the Light, and we have Skywrath Mage who looks like an angel but is actually a flying chicken who wouldn't shut up even at 3 in the morning, just like actual roosters minus the completely airborne part.

So yeah, when will we get angels for heroes?~|question

Why do Prowlers HAVE to stomp?|self.DotA2|~All other creeps, except for the dinosaurs, do not cast their abilities unless there are a total of 3 heroes or summons in their aggro range. Centaurs, Hellbears, Dragons, they're all chill creeps. They don't fuck your clarities or reduce your amor by 5 million and poes you for half your life. 

You can make the argument that only scrubs get rooted, as you can easily dodge the stomp by kiting them, and you'd be right. What fucking gets me is that you can accidentally walk too close to them on your way somewhere else and the bastards would root you just for the hell of it. 

What do you guys think? Change their rules to be the same as other creeps? Add an RNG factor so they sometimes stomp, sometimes not? Downvote this post and comment git gud?~|question

Is this an intended game mechanic? (Legion Commander vs Meepo)|self.DotA2|~Was playing as LC and saw a Meepo (let's call him M1) about to die.  So I boost over to the nearest Meepo (M2) I could find to squeeze in a duel.

M1 dies while M2 was being duelled, meaning *all* Meepos died while one of them was being duelled.  But I got no damage or "Winner" message.

For every other hero the mechanic is "if killed while in a duel, damage goes to other hero".   Given that all versions of Meepo are treated as a full hero (even in terms of EXP earned), it seems counter-intuitive to make this lone exception for duels.
 
Surely this is just a (fairly major) bug?? ~|question

What should you expect from Virtus Pro?|self.DotA2|~I've made some research on vp and i want to share with you guys what i found out. 

**They don't value (or valued) CM nearly as much as other T1 teams**

Pretty much every top tier 5 position in their last 50 games has cm as one of their 3 most [picked heroes](https://1drv.ms/x/s!ArCBdVoOzsc7mUhzy6fNUjymXwQA) . A lot of people consider VP a very aggressive team and at the same time people considered the meta "aggressive" . One of the reasons people attributed to the higher tempo was crystal maiden yet vp was able to consistently achieve good results ignoring the hero. I'm not sure I can really explain why they don't like it . The best i can give you guys is that most of the time since solo dies a lot and goes for very deep wards/plays it makes more sense to give him a hero that has big skills and needs 0 items. Warlock and Disruptor are heroes that have very high impact and range allowing him to be relevant even with 10 deaths. Quite different from cm. 

**They are probably the kings of courrier sniping**

There's no website that allows you to get the data on courrier sniping (at least that i'm aware of) . Even then when you think about it currently it's hard not to think about vp. I asked @noxville about it and he made his own [research](http://imgur.com/a/0c633) .

**While everyone praises no[o]ne and Ramzes lil and 9pasha are way more targeted by bans**

Dark seer, Wisp and Magnus are by FAR the biggest heroes targeted by other teams. When you have allies as skilled as virtus pro  the ability to enhance their performance can be overwhelming to other teams and this is why i feel like most t1 teams usually have an io player (and amazing cores). While magnus is heritage from the old magnus patch dark seer is still fairly often a first [phase ban against VP](https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/teams/1883502/counters?date=3month). Another fairly often ban target is ursa. During the kiev majors the no[o]ne ursa mid was a very strong tool in their good run during the tournament and a lot of people still go for the ban. It's a good pick because one of [ramze's 3 most picked heroes](https://1drv.ms/x/s!ArCBdVoOzsc7mUhzy6fNUjymXwQA) include ursa giving a lot of versatility to the team since not many teams have mid and carry players that can swap their heroes besides juggernaut.   

**Even though VP has amazing results in the last months Solo has the lowest gpm of every t1 5 support and one of the highest death avgs**

A lot of people comment on it. The way solo plays is very bold. He will go for aggresive wards and moves and a lot of times he doesn't care about dying (at least it seems like it ) . The fact he has so many high skilled players in his team (and thus, greedy players) works very well with that type of support player. If he was too careful or scared someone will be eventually a target of key spells, timings and smoke ganks. This stat backs up my view on why vp doesn't really like cm all that much. The hero has no way to compensate for a lot of deaths and doesn't scale only with levels (like disruptor/warlock). That's not really the case for rubick but if you pay attention to the [stats](https://1drv.ms/x/s!ArCBdVoOzsc7mUhzy6fNUjymXwQA) most of the time solo has way less deaths on rubick than other heroes. 

*Avg deaths on Disruptor:* **5** 

*Avg deaths on Warlock:* **4** 

*Avg deaths on Rubick:* **3** 

**They are actually dota hipsters**

With the exception of [newbee](https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/teams/1375614/picks?date=3month) [vp](https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/teams/1883502/picks?date=3month) is one of the only teams in the world that ban so much treant . Part of it is because vp don't play the hero so much but also because they value some heroes highly that other t1 teams do [eg](https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/teams/39/picks?date=3month) [liquid] (https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/teams/2163/picks?date=3month) [secret] (https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/teams/1838315/picks?date=3month) [IG] (https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/teams/5/picks?date=3month). None of these teams pick a lot of either Ursa, Jugger, troll or svenand they have in them pushing power, roshan taking and are melee heroes that get kited. Treant works very well against them because he can scout roshan, heal towers and root everyone (even through bkb). 

I know a lot of the stuff here can seem "simple" and that was my intent with the research and video. I want to dip most people that don't play a lot of dota or don't understand competitive in what every t1 team is about.


**I made a [video about the info here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsAk49iXalw), this is my first [crowdfund](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/i-want-bowie-to-make-content-for-ti7-in-seatle-games) "rewards" video . I plan to make 2-3 extra videos about the invited teams and as of now the teams with more votes are OG/Liquid . Hope you guys enjoy it**~|question esports
Why are they making highground push harder and harder?|self.DotA2|~Since 7.00 highground is getting insane.

-towers adopted Timbersaw's armor strategy

-5 tactical mini fountains to wash away the salt from the defending team

-random civilian buildings have been replaced with bulkier fountains and statues that try too hard to be unique and funny, meaning creeps get stuck while reading the memes

-t4 started drinking ancient's jizz so they regen like the ancient

-many heroes became so talented that they can force the ancient to revive them faster

What is next?Inhibitors barracks respawn after 5 minutes?Turrets on base walls?

Edit:What the actual fuck is "TI4" argument???Did TI4 happen just before 7.00?Am I going crazy?Or better yet was highground ez since TI4 meaning frog waited 2 years to fix it?I am comparing it to 6.88 and Boston Major ffs...~|question

Announcer Packs rotting in the workshop...|self.DotA2|~Ok, so I am puzzled. Among the 30 which are visible, there are a couple announcer packs submitted to the workshop, which are actually quite entertaining. Some have been sitting there for years - collecting virtual dust, and were not added to the game.

Does Valve just not care to use anything which does not already have a massive following from other games/TV shows, etc? The announcer packs which are accepted/available to purchase are nearly all voices from heroes in Dota 2, other games, and TV shows.

I ask this because I am a professional opera singer/actor/narrator. I am considering creating a pack for Dota 2 because I love the game... however, I am not going to spend dozens or hundreds of hours writing/recording/editing/mastering 400-600 audio files plus create a spreadsheet... if it's not even going to have a chance of making it into the game because it's not already a recognizable/copyrighted/licensed voice from an existing piece of media.

Does anyone have anything useful to say regarding this? Would love to create something fun and entertaining for the game, but don't want to just waste my time if it's got a huge chance of just rotting in the Workshop without Valve listening to/looking at it.

*EDIT*

The announcer pack I want to create is: Two dragons - brothers, both redneck/southern, and using all kinds of "tasteful" body/toilet humor. Samples of my work while playing around with the idea are in the YouTube audio clip linked here:

Is this an exploit?|self.DotA2|~**UPDATE: I think the most likely explanation is a bug in dotabuff's assist gold reporting. Since this got so much attention, I've emailed dotabuff support asking them to chime in. (If anyone remembers the dotabuff admin's reddit username, PM them this thread!)**

===

Please check my arithmetic, but I believe at least one member of this 5-stack could be using some sort of gold exploit. The stack had a 44-winstreak victory shout, which seemed highly unusual. 

Here is an example game:
http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1290564153

Click the Dotabuff+ "Kills" tab, and look at the Timbersaw player's Kill and Assist gold.


  | # | Gold earned
---|---|----
Kills | 18 | 5709
Assists | 14 | 10215

Timbersaw earned over 10k gold for receiving 14 assists.

* Maximum assist gold occurs when only 1 hero is present, and is computed by **40 + (7  Dying Hero's Level) + (0.05  Dying Hero's Net Worth  Net Worth Difference)**

* In this game, Dire led gold advantage the entire game, so there is no rubberband term in assist gold payout.

* The highest level radiant player was level 19. 

Thus, the theoretical maximum amount of gold for an assist is 40 + (7  Dying Hero's Level)  = 40 + (7 * 19) = 173. 

&nbsp;

For the sake of argument, pretend Timbersaw assisted against a level 19 hero for all 14 of his assists. Then his gold would be 173 * 14 = **2422**. But his actual assist gold is **10215**.

&nbsp;

It appears that in this game, this player received many times more assist gold than he should have. There are many other example games in the player's game history which show the same pattern of an inflated assist gold value.

Moreover, at least one of the players in this stack was VAC banned, according to this [VAC ban checker](http://www.vacbanned.com/engine/check). The player is:
http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198069064596

These five players seem to play almost exclusively together.

&nbsp;

**Did I make an arithmetic error? Is there a bug with dotabuff's assist gold reporting? Is there some sort of new exploit related to assist gold?**~|question

I don't think it makes sense to launch a Battle Pass amid the holidays (Christmas Eve and New Years Eve), so maybe it could/should wait until mid January, but we are really eager to play again as a team in a "competitive" enviroment. So please Valve,

1. Announce it, so people can make plans accordingly (comitting to playing saturdays at a specific schedule).
2. Don't take to long either! :D~|question
Team Unknown mid player intentionally throwing? [maybe match fixing?]|self.DotA2|~Anyone watching this game between Team Unknown and Pain Gaming for The Summit AM can see that the mid player ("sad boy") for unknown is not taking the game seriously, at all. For starters his item progression was brown boots -> brown boots -> ghost scepter as a mid shadow fiend, and then he's doing really obviously throwy stuff like TP'ing in to the middle of 5 players only to insta die, and cancelling his requiem in spots where it would be really good to let it go off. 

It really ruins pro dota when players don't take matches seriously. I was an unknown fan after watching them play during the frankfurt major qualifiers but this is putting a sour taste in my mouth. 

I really wonder if there is some sort of match fixing going on given how big of favourites they were going in to this match - obviously there isn't enough evidence to say that for sure but I think it's worth looking into.

Not to take anything away from how Pain gaming are playing - they're obviously playing very well. And the rest of Team Unknown also seem to be trying really hard to win. It's just their mid player that seems to be trying his hardest to lose the game for the team.

Rubick stealing the reworked PA dagger|self.DotA2|~So I just played a game as Rubick and whenever I stole PA's dagger I noticed that when I threw it (to start with just at her) I wasn't doing any damage. 

I thought maybe it was some interaction with her evasion, or maybe my damage was so low relative to her health and reduction I wasn't seeing much damage from the dagger. I then tried it on a creep and it does 0 damage. It still applies the slow, and I would guess any orb effects (though I didn't have any so I can't confirm) but the damage portion of the spell simply does not copy over.

This has to be a bug, right?~|question

Why is there no longer hero skill descriptions during the picking phase?|self.DotA2|You hover over your hero's skills and nothing pops up any more. It was helpful to read skill descriptions while you were waiting for everyone to pick their hero but it's no longer there and you have to go to the hero page to read any of the descriptions. |question
Attack Speed vs Damage - What Should I get?|self.DotA2|~Tl;dr: All things being equal, you want exactly 100 more damage than increased attack speed (IAS) in order to maximize right click DPS. This means the sword icon (attack damage) and hand icon (total attack speed) in the UI should be equal (Thanks /u/GodsFaithInHumanity).

I have always wondered about the relationship between increased attack speed (IAS) and damage. I would occasionally go through the math for a specific case to figure out if I want damage or increased attack speed in order  to maximize raw auto-attack DPS. 

I got tired of doing this so I finally did some number crunching and made an interesting discovery, *you want exactly 100 more damage than increased attack speed in order to maximize raw right-click DPS*. Obviously there are many other factor to consider when deciding which item to buy, but this is a great piece of information to take into account.

So for example, if you have 300 damage and 150 IAS, a point of IAS is more valuable than a point of damage. If you have 300 damage and 200 IAS, its a wash, a point of IAS is equal to a point of damage. If you have 300 damage and 250 IAS, then damage is better. 

Just how much better is it? Consider a level 25 Dragon Knight with Armlet, BKB, Daedalus, and BOTs. Taking into account his likely talents, we get 326 damage and 116 IAS with Armlet on, so obviously we want to bump up that IAS. The 55 IAS from a 2k gold Hyperstone would increase DPS by 105, whereas 46 Damage from 2.4k gold Demon Edge would only increase DPS by 58. That is 19 gold per DPS vs 41 gold per DPS. Over twice the value! Pretty significant if you ask me.

Considering how cheap AS is compared to damage, and how often your damage can greatly surpass your AS, I think AS is often the way to go to maximize damage, especially for strength or int carries who dont get AS from their primary attribute. So basically - buy more Mjollnirs.


*Math:*

APS = attacks per second

DPS = damage per second

IAS = Increased attack speed

D = Attack damage

BAT = base attack time



1.)	DPS = APS * D

2.)	APS = ((100 + IAS) .01)/BAT

3.)	Thus, DPS = (D + (.01)IAS*D)/BAT

EDIT: Attack speed reduces attack point animation by the same factor, so it does matter even for 1 attack. It can easily be the difference between getting the attack off or not, getting two vs one, three vs two, etc... It just isn't true to say you have to stand there and right for a few seconds for attack speed to matter.

Also, if it wasn't clear in the post, obviously your hero's spells need to be considered first. And what the item does is vital too. This is just one small piece of the puzzle. More of an "all things being equal" consideration.

EDIT2: I changed attack speed to increased attack speed (IAS) in the post. So you want damage and total attack speed, which is 100 + IAS, to be the same.~|question
I had a 2:50:00 game end suddenly, with neither ancient dying and both teams with active players. Why did this game end?|self.DotA2|~https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/3857451448

Some people abandoned throughout the game, and the techies team stalled for a bit to try and March of the Valkyries down mid and sneak attack mines from the trees. At the end, only Sniper and Riki on radiant and Techies and Death Prophet on dire were still playing.

I'm really confused about why this game ended, any insight or knowledge?

edit: [Here is the screen caps of the combat log at the very end.](https://imgur.com/a/sUFcvnM) Just after the ancient starts to explode, there's red text at the top that says "The game server is attempting to send match results to the game coordinator..."~|question

What happened to weather effects?|self.DotA2|~They look just so much worse than they used to.

Now it feels like nothing more than a purple filter with some sparkles thrown around the place. [You can see the difference very clearly here](http://i.imgur.com/g4bdtMD.jpg), this is a comparison between the source 1 moonbeam and the current one. Here are also some screenshots of the old source 2 moonbeam I've found on my hard drive: http://i.imgur.com/JmudgNO.png http://i.imgur.com/2D9jsE1.png http://i.imgur.com/JWWGSKa.png

Friends got assessed with abandons for babysitting our open throne against a Wisp backdoor threat. What to do in these situations?|self.DotA2|~Here's the match on dotabuff: http://dotabuff.com/matches/806090496

The other team had a very hard-hitting Weaver and Legion + Wisp that could easily backdoor our ancient if we didn't have at least a couple guys to defend. The unfortunate part was that we had mega creeps so the lanes were constantly pushed in our favour so they wouldn't be in range of their creeps dying for EXP (we didn't find out until after the game that AFK abandon is determined by 5 minutes without EXP, since we never afk-abandon games and we hadn't encountered this problem before). 

I doubt there's a way to 'appeal' to have an abandon revoked but I just wanted to bring attention to the fact that someone who is playing to win and not AFK can be inaccurately assessed an abandon under the current system. Kind of shitty to find out that after 86 minutes of a stressful game it didn't even count as a win for them. ~|question

Doesn't that feel like a great disadvantage, considering it's always the other way around in every other tournament?

Make it at least so that you don't have to play right after you lost a series for elimination, since im sure  it can affect the result/mentality. ~|question esports

Gabe Newell just gave a presentation at my university, and he touched on Dota 2 a few times. I recorded part of it, and I was wondering if there would be any interest in me posting it.|self.DotA2|~Hey guys,

So Gabe Newell just came down to the University of Texas at Austin where I attend and [gave a talk](http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2013/01/28/gabe-newell-on-productivity-economics-political-institutions-and-the-future-of-corporations-29th-january-university-of-texas/) concerning the economics and direction of Valve and where he thinks that they, their games, and their entire industry is going. He spent a little time talking about a few things Dota 2 releated, such as his reflections on Na'vi (specifically Dendi), its future in eSports, and even an explanation for why they instituted the privacy settings in response to Dotabuff's DBR.

It would take me a little while to edit, so I just want to see if people would like to hear about it so I know whether or not to go through the trouble.

**EDIT:** Here's a photo I took from my seat 10 feet away from him: http://imgur.com/z2UAdLm

**EDIT 2:** I'm getting a lot of messages in my inbox saying this was a stupid thread and a blatant karma-whoring attempt, so let me explain: Since most of the presentation was about Valve's corporate economics and Gabe's reflections on the future of gaming, Dota 2 was NOT the main focus of the talk (even though it did come up). Because of that, I was afraid I might be breaking the subreddit rules by not being relevant -- hence why I posted this. As for the karma-whoring, this is a self-post on a throwaway account for that very reason. Sorry for making this more difficult than it had to be. I'll start working on it.

**EDIT 3:** I contacted the people in charge to ask if it would be alright for me to post what I had recorded to Reddit, and they weren't exactly... encouraging. In order to avoid potential legal repercussions to myself, I'm currently working with them to figure something out, and I think you will all be pleased with the solution in the end. Don't worry: OP will deliver.

A teammate paused for a second, you instantly unpause.

We discuss who will go where pre-match. SF says he will go mid, we all agree. You then proceed to rush down mid, refusing to leave.

You don't even ping. Not one little speck of help.

Now, may I ask why you are playing a TEAM RELIANT game in RANKED MODE and playing completely solo? Go play WoW if you want to just grind creeps all game and play solo, I mean what the fuck. We need your help in a teamfight and your sitting in the jungle at level 12 30 minutes in.

Nothing tilts a team more than asking a tidehunter to ravage, just to watch him waste his ravage on a cm 8 levels below him. Yeah, I'm sure that 100 gold was worth more than wiping the team and getting a huge push.

Are there many Older Dota 2 players out there (40+)|self.DotA2|~I would like to hear of other older players and how they got into playing Dota and how they find it now as opposed to when they started? i dont talk dota with anyone in RL, to my own generation dota is a mystery. shock is the common reaction i get if i talk about my age in game so i rarely do so.

me, I have always played games, in the 2000's i played mostly CS, then CS source, got a beta key for Dota in 2012 and been hooked since then. 

my 20yr old daughter thinks its cool that i play dota, my wife is not so approving i suspect, sometimes i play a bit too much and i know it pisses her off, but thats hardly suprising in a marrige, no one is perfect. 

I have started to notice that my mechanical skills are deteriorating and i definately have difficult seeing whats what in big team fights with all the particles and stuff filling the screen. 

As a dota player i spam a lot of CM (i'll soon get to my 1000th game as CM), i am not great in roles other than support becuase i fixate on enemy heros, so i am a very limited player in my opinion, but i dont have the inclination to change that. playing how i play is just too much fun for me.

/edit

I'M a bit staggered by the number of responses, i was going to reply to most of them but I wanted to play a game of dota and I reckoned ye would understand.~|question

Why does Monkey's ult go through aegis anyway?|self.DotA2|~Every hero that had this perk got stripped of it(Death Prophet, Lycan, Terrorblade, Razor etc.), even those having much higher cooldown, because it was considered imbalanced. 

Why add a new hero that gets this specific pro even though it doesn't make sense comparing to other spells that stopped going through aegis.

It's almost as if a certain company was trying to sell specific items of certain quality by making a hero much stronger by intention.

Newbee Young match fix? 22.07.16|self.DotA2|~Ok, so I''ll lead with this, I don't have any proof, only suspicions.

**I came across some weird odds when betting on Pinnacle. They seemed to good to be true, and they probably were. These two games were played today 22.07.16 in VPGame PRO League**

* Game 1. Newbee.Y vs Braveheart.Z 

Newbee.Y is an established team, ranked 30 globally. Braveheart.Z is ranked 100+ and barely played a single professional game, Newbee.Y should be huge favourites.  Other books list Newbee.Y @1.40~~ vs Braveheart.Z @3.00~~. On Pinnacle odds start at Newbee.Y @3.00 vs Braveheart.Z @1.40 . Up untill match start, the odds continue to shift in favour of Braveheart.Z ending somewhere around **Braveheart.Z @1.10 Newbee.Y @7.00+**

* Game 2. Newbee.Y(again, coincidence?) vs FTD.C

FTD.C  are listed as small favourites on the other books. Roughly FTD.C @1.5~~ vs Newbee.Y @2.5~~. 
The teams have almost the exact same global rank.On pinnacle odds start at Newbee.Y @ 3.5 vs FTD.C @1.3, but again the odds rapidily change in the last hour before game start. Odds at close are **FTD.C @1.1 vs Newbee.Y @8+**



**Odds never change like this in pro matches, which is suspicious on it's own. That they only change on Pinnacle, and remains the same on every other book is even more weird. The only reason the odds changed like this is because someone has made huge bets on these teams, and continued doing so, even when given terrible odds. It's extremely unlikely that someone would do this without fishy insider information**

So what were the results of the games? Without surprise, Newbee.Y lost both. They didn't obviously throw, but played passive in both games and made no attempt to defend when Braveheart.Z and FTD.C pushed highground.

If anyone have anything to add to this, please do so. I have a really weird feeling about these games

* ***PS. Pinnacle seems to be suspicious of the situation as well, the bets on game 2 have yet to be settled, hours after the game ended. I really don't think it's a coincidence, they probably noticed a lot of abnormal betting patterns***

*Update 23.07.16*
Woke up this morning and logged in to Pinnacle. In the message box I received the following message regarding match 2:

* *"[E Sports] [Dota 2 - VPGame Proleague] [Match] Newbee Youth vs FTD Club C. Your bet with ticket-ID: 616564741, 616582363 has been refunded. All bets taken have been refunded due to the following reason: [Abnormal and suspicious betting activity has been detected for this event. All wagers from all customers have been cancelled. This action is taken very rarely and is for the protection of all our customers.] ."*

Sounds like a pretty good confiramtion to me, and I'm really happy that Pinnacle did this. It proves that they care about e-sports and most of all their customers. Of course I wish they would do the same thing with game 1, but I understand that's probably a lot harder since the bets on game 1 were settled immediatly after match end

I'm trying to make a basic guide of mechanics for new Dota 2 players, and it's kinda difficult to categorize on a table to point what you should learn first, and progress after that.

Will DireTide or a Halloween event be making a comeback this year?|self.DotA2|~I personally loved diretide, I thought it was a great minigame/gamemode. I'm just wondering have valve released or announced any plans to bring back Diretide this year or another Halloween event. 

imo these events are great, Diretide, Greeviling, hell Compendium Matchmaking (if you can call it an event) wasn't that bad, especially with the free smeevil treat you got if you played it on its first few days of release before the player cards etc were unlocked. 
Even if valve don't bring back Diretide, I'm sure another form of a Halloween gamemode would be just as big of a hit. Don't forget the fact that you guys can use this opportunity to spam out more "limited edition" cosmetics too!

TL:DR Volvo bring back Diretide or a halloween variant, it was great. ~|question

I went from average 110 fps on a single area to average 40 fps ( without march ) just by spamming Tinker's March nonstop for 3 minutes on practice. Why does the performance get so much worse the longer the game goes?|self.DotA2|~https://i1.someimage.com/mEyxaRX.jpg

https://i1.someimage.com/RWJWA0m.jpg

This is reproducible very easily and fast just by enabling free spells and spamming a particle heavy spell.

If I create a new game the fps becomes normal again, but the more marchs are casted inside a single game, the worse the average fps gets even outside those areas.

There is something wrong with some of the particles management on this game and this is per spell / hat basis I think. Maybe there are even hats or spells that aren't released when each game ends ( processing use ).

Does anyone else have this problem?|question
Why do ppl leave in All Random?|self.DotA2|~I don't really get this: lately, more ppl seem to insta leave in all random, if they get a hero they don't want to play.

1) There is repick - I'm not sure why ppl don't use that option. Yes, you lose gold - so what? It still is worth a shot. Maybe you get lucky and can play a hero you already know.

2) You can swap. Often other players aren't happy with their heroes either, so simply communicate and try to find someone who wants to swap.

3) If no one wants to swap, simply give it a try. There is always a good chance enemy team doesn't know how to play their heroes either.

4) If you are not up for this, why even select fucking ALL RANDOM?

~|question
'Courier Deliver Items' and 'Deliver Items from Stash' have a pass range, but if I shift-queue it, the courier walks up to 0 range to the hero - why?|self.DotA2|~So basically when I use hotkeys to deliver items, the courier can pass the items to me from a range of ~~400 (dunno exactly, definitely higher than 0 range), but if I shift-queue "Deliver Items" -> "Return to Base", the courier still passes items to me from being ~~400 range away, but after that it continues to walk up to 0 range of my hero before it actually returns. The same happens if I press "Deliver items", hold shift and right-click courier back to base.

Why does the courier behave like that? Bug? Intention? Am I just doing it wrong?~|question

How am I supposed to avoid this kind of griefing? (Allied Tiny tossing me to cliff and tossing me to cancel my TP)|self.DotA2|~I just played with a stack who obviously planned this out because it involved Tiny going Helm of the Dominator and Force Staff before any other real items. Early on, Tiny dominated a creep, force staffed it onto a cliff, and then tossed me to the creep. As soon as I started the channel Tiny tossed me (he force staffed himself onto the cliff) and interrupted it. They also warded the camp next to the cliff so I couldn't nuke it for xp. Tiny stayed there until I got an abandon. (Of course, the other guy in his stack proceeded to spam "JAJA REPORT KOTL AFK" in all chat.)

What am I supposed to do against this kind of thing? Disable Help doesn't work against Toss.

What was your biggest misconception as a noob?|self.DotA2|~I thought that Viper was the "evolved" version of Venomancer. Tiny grew bigger ? Veno turned into Viper. It made sense, like, for a couple of games.

Shouldn't the "Reddit's MMR" thing at the side say "(party rating)" instead of solo rating?|self.DotA2|It would make more sense coz we're a party of reddit people aren't we. I couldn't figure out what the number meant to begin with , I thought they took our combined mmr from dotabuff somehow. But if it said "party MMR" instead of solo I think it would have made more sense. What do you think|question
I just started Dota2|self.DotA2|Hey guys! I just started playing Dota. I came over from LoL, and its pretty different, but the characters in it are really cool. But I have a very big problem with it. None of the characters I actually enjoy (Medusa, Naga Siren, Crystal Maiden) are available to me in multiplayer. I was told coming over every hero was unlocked, so the first game I played multiplayer I was floored to find out I couldn't actually play who I wanted. I don't suppose there is any way to hasten the process like perhaps beating AI for 25 games? In all honesty I am having a hard time enjoying multiplayer since I can't even drop a bit of cash to buy CM for those first 25 games. Anyways, if any of you can help please do! I really want to enjoy multiplayer but I don't know if I can do all 25 with Sniper. Thank you.|question
Sound problem since the new patch?|self.DotA2|Hey guys, since the latest patch my buyback sound, respawn sound and victory sound are all not playing at all. Quite frustrating as I rely on those cues (esp respawn) when I play. Anyone else been experiencing similar issues?|question
New player here. I already love Dota2, but I have an hard time finding polite and cooperative people to play with|self.DotA2|~Hey guys, I've been playing SC2 and SCBW for many years and , after watching Day9 tutorials, I decided to give dota2 a try.

After 100 hours, even though I think I'm still new cause I don't know half of heroes skill, I can safely say I love the game, especially for the teamplay aspect that I've never experienced in Starcraft. Unfortunately, my experience with the community hasn't been that great at all. 

I started vs bots so I could not upset anyone when learning the basics, then I switched to unranked to have a feeling of what "real" dota is. As I said, the game feels stellar, but the people I'm playing with are usually behaving terribly. I'm not a sensitive man, but after a whole day spent between university,studying and gym, I would like to enjoy the game and not waste 40-50 minutes of my time because people refuse to communicate, call people names, get upset because I'm dying in a damn unranked match or start trolling or feeding because that's what gives them joy. 

I play Dota because I like the team aspect, otherwise I'd just play only SC. So guys, how do you deal with this mess? Does it get better in ranked mode? Is there a place to find cooperative people to play with who realize that it is just a game and we should not get mad because of it and behave politely?

Did anyone notice Arteezy gave LaNm a Bottle charge during EG vs. DK?|self.DotA2|~I was busy today, so I just get to watch replays. In Match ID 772457564, EG vs. DK 29:00 replay time/14:21 game time: ppd's Bane puts a Fiend's Grip onto LaNm's Juggernaut as Arteezy's Tinker Travels in. Arteezy casts Heat Seeking Missile into Laser, then gives a Bottle charge to LaNm (!) before going for a single right click before being Omnislashed; then EG are stunned and counter-ganked by MMY! and BurNIng.

Now, here's some notes:

1. ~~~~This did not change the effect of the gank. Slowing the replay down shows that the Laser left LaNm at 88 HP with 6.46 armor; Arteezy only had 70 Auto-Attack Damage (Damage variance: up to 73), and neither ppd nor the nearby Radiant Siege Creep attacked LaNm afterwards.~~~~ This likely **DID** change the effect of the gank: LaNm was drained to 195 Mana from the Fiend's Grip, and Omnislash level 1 requires 200 mana. Juggernaut had a Mana regeneration rate of 0.97 Mana/second, but managed to cast Omnislash only 2.20 seconds after the last tick of Fiend's Grip. Had he not Omnislashed just then, Arteezy would likely have been able to squeeze off that last Auto-Attack in-progress. ~~/u/TheSparrowX

2. The Bottle charge activated immediately after Laser landed, during what appears to be Laser's backswing. This basically gave it the maximum possible duration before Arteezy's Auto-Attack landed.

3. Neither TobiWan nor syndereN seem to take note of or comment on the Bottle usage.

4. It's possible Arteezy was holding Control for some awful reason while mashing his Bottle and gave LaNm the charge (why would this target Enemies though?), but what's more likely is:

5. For those of you who don't know, there was a bug floating around a few months (a year?) ago where Tinker (or Treant Protector, or any Hero with Boots of Travel to a lesser extent) could share Bottle charges globally by abusing the fact that Targets in Dota 2 seem to be tied to Units, rather than to Abilities. This bug was "fixed", but later it was discovered that any Hero could instantly kill Razor from across the map with a Blade Mail, a Ring of Basillius, and a Town Portal Scroll.

(Town Portal targets Razor (who is a valid target for 'frog knows why (Units weren't even valid targets in DotA 1, only ground)); and then spam-toggling Ring of Basillius (changed from DotA 1 to no longer interrupt Channeling) would force the Ring of Basillius ability to target Razor, triggering Unstable Current, which is Returned via Blade Mail.)

Now, from these isolated cases, it seems that Valve never actually fixed that no-target Abilities used during other Abilities would inherit their target from the Hero's current target, and simply disabled these certain Abilities from targeting in this way. This event today seems to indicate this further. What ought to be done about this? I don't know, but it seems to me that the targeting thing is some bug with the Dota 2 engine, which may not be so easy to fix without unforeseen consequences. This is just intuition, however; I am not a Valve developer.

Dissere.

edit: appears to have been fixed~|question esports

Fellow high mmr Storm players, how do you proc your overload charges?|self.DotA2|~Do you simply use right click or do you use attack move assigned hotkey?       
Right now my combo for solo pick offs is.     
1. Roll near enemy behind him while attack moving/throwing overload whilst in a roll.     
2. When I past by him, I press Remenant quickly followed by attack move to lose the second overload charge.       
3. Then depending on the situation, I use Vortex and attack move to lose the third charge or make small rolls to abuse turn rate and lose 3x overload charges and wait for the next Remnant to come off c/d.          
Can you provide me some tips? I want to be as smooth as possible executing my combo. I have been playing a lot and watching replays (sumail and Miracle) but I really need specific details. I find that there is quite a delay after step  one. Should I roll again and then pop the first Remnant?      
***EDIT*** : Since people helped with upvotes, here are the two things that were unnoticed by me that should be helpful to fellow Storm players to think about/brainstorm.       

* Turn rate after roll causes a delay      
* Vortex < Lv.3 causes delay in combo'ing

Why the hell isn't RD in Ranked? Thread #1536|self.DotA2|~Right now you have the two captain's modes, where you put your faith in a random stranger to draft an entire lineup for your team...or AP, which is just "wait until 0:01 to pick your hero or wait to counter pick".

Random Draft at least allows a team to communicate early to try and form coherent strategies...and worse case no one listens and at least you get to pick a hero that you think fits the lineup or you want to play.

Please upvote for visibility.  Let's have 6.81 come with RD in Ranked mode...for the sanity of mankind.~|question
