Team Secrets Pugna just failed a gank on an SF due to a targeting bug|self.DotA2|~Twitch clip: https://clips.twitch.tv/SmokyFantasticDoveOpieOP

**Edit:** In-game perspective: https://youtu.be/6nmx_pcggBk

---

Ethereal units have a lower targeting priority than non-ethereal units that are close to them, which causes the ethereal unit to not be targeted by a spell/item, despite trying to target it **(This apparently only applies to quick-cast targeting)**.

The non-ethereal unit that is next to it will be targeted instead.

This led to the Pugna targeting the Earth Shaker instead of the SF, despite just having dagoned the SF (an item that cannot target allies) and thus not needing to move the mouse cursor to follow up with a Life Drain.

This cost them the shakers life and the gank (SF survived, ES died, pugna had to retreat on low HP).

Large Post Of Bugs In 7.00|self.DotA2|~EDIT: *Updated with the recent patches*

This is an updated collection of bugs  that I have encountered ingame and/or read on /r/dota2.

____

#General 


* **[Unable to put items into sticky buy](https://gfycat.com/UnfortunateTestyBighornsheep)**

* Tidehunter's Anchor Smash, Slardar's Slithereen Crush,Bristleback's Quill Spray,Alchemist's Acid Spray,Dazzle's Poison Touch,All Possible Cleaving,Lone Druid's Spirit Bear entangling claws,Razor's Eye of the storm,BeastMaster's Primal Roar and Wild Axes,

All these spells deal damage when necrophos is in ghost shroud.They are blocked with Ghost scepter/Decrepify/Ethereal Blade.

Some spells are blocked with Ghost Shroud:Phantom Assasin's Stifling Dagger,Monkey King's Boundless Strike,Juggernaut's Omnislash.

* [Techies can stack proximity mines if his cast range is larger than 400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQnct5w9M8g)

* [Kinetic Gem Trapper's Treachery not working.](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=275337)

* The Crow's Feet kinetic gem doesn't work with the Ripper's Reel.

* If Chen uses Holy Persuasion on an enemy HoD creep, and then Chen uses his own HoD on another creep, the former enemy HoD creep (now owned by Chen with Holy Persuasion) dies.

* If You wait too long to pick a hero after draft in Captains mode. Draft screen will not go away.(Reconnecting or even restarting dota won't fix it.)

* If you open the shop at side shop and then teleport somewhere you can't buy items in base until you open and reclose the shop because it says you are not by the sideshop even when the item isn't bought at the sideshop.


* Lina's Fiery Soul description is missing the 10 seconds duration.

* Lina's level 25 talent. It says "firey souls" instead of "fiery".


* When buying items through autobuy or using shift+click to add them to the queue, it ignores items you acquired through Disassemble. Whether combining is unlocked or not it doesn't matter, so if you use the autobuy ( right click ) or buy the items in the queue, you will waste gold buying another duplicate of an item from the recipe you already have.

* You can not buy items if you click spammed buy/sell on strategy screen and hit the game's item limit.

* [Neutral creep spawn outside of camp.](https://gfycat.com/ElectricKindDassie)

* CTRL clicking Remote mines no longer selects all remote mines visible on the screen. Previously, CTRL clicking a single remote mine on the ground would select all nearby mines that were in vision of your screen.

* Force Staff cancels Blast Off on a mid-air Techies

* [Magnus skewer can still port people back to his fountain. Apparently it's an old bug from 6.87 and is related to Slark.](https://gfycat.com/DampHeartfeltAmurstarfish)

* Live tournament matches lag when heroes use illusion based skills/items like Manta, Illusion rune or Disruption.

* When getting Level 25 Talent on Huskar that increases Ult Cast Range, the skill loses the cast range indicator when trying to use it.

* [Oftentimes numbers on the new HUD turn into ellipses instead of being truncated or rounded. This is incredibly irritating when it happens to movespeed because movespeed info is not displayed anywhere else.](http://i.imgur.com/hwle1ww.jpg)


* Tinker's Aghanim Scepter Laser bounces to Visage's Familiars

* Default cosmetics still sometimes do not load correctly and the hero only has their base model(Naked Monkey King).

* If you level up a skill at 16 you can't get your ulti at 17 as Meepo but if you don't level up anything at 16 you can skill your ulti at 17.

* [Sometimes the item icons in quickbuy is replaced with a black box.](https://i.imgur.com/PIfT08V.png)

* [The Ancient Prowler Shaman's Desecrate debuff states that it also slows movespeed, but it does not.](http://i.imgur.com/sY10yOm.png)

* Accepting a game while spectating another that is in pick/strategy phase crashes the game.

* [Since 7.00 update 3rd level of ulti is available at lvl 18, but scoreboard shows it at lvl 17.](https://i.imgur.com/lj0hKscl.png)

* [These are not working in Dota TV and Replay.](http://imgur.com/UK1XyH4)

* There is no re-roll buttons in all pick or random draft (non-ranked)

* Hover-popping: Display of heroes buggy after a match. [[video](https://gfycat.com/EmbarrassedRichChevrotain)] 

* "Select Hero" doesn't center camera on hero: Have "Hold Select Hero to Follow" turned on and while using it 
simultaneously drag the Camera Grip to pan the display. After you've released everything, tapping "Select Hero" will not center the display on the hero but instead remembers the camera-grip offset. (This bug emerged just before 700. Does not seem intentional [flickers briefly to the expected location], and is mildly infuriating when 
trying to quickly find your hero)

* In Hero Demo mode, various non-hero units display a talent tree when the area is hovered, e.g. Pugna's Nether ward

* The end of the restock timer seems to be off by a second

* Demo Options appears on top of the Shop menu when map is on right. (Would clearly be better with the Z-order swapped)

* All-bot games are rampant and are even making it to the top results of the "Watch Live" screen

* [A problem with buying items for Axe spawned using spawn enemy.]
(http://i.imgur.com/wmKA9pE.jpg)

* Templar Assassin's Trap's Tooltip states that the trap slows by *"up to 50%."* -- Traps slow up to 60%

* Templar Assassin's Trap's Slow Tooltip has the same problem. 

* Templar Assassin's Traps visually only slow 30%. (If a hero with 300 MS gets slowed by a max charged trap, their MS will appear to be 210.) I believe this is just a visual bug.

* Tooltip shows Centaur aghs damage reduction being increased by spell amp. It is not.

* When quick-buying Power Treads, the Belt of Strength is not removed from buying Band of Elvenskin or Robe of the Magi.

* Dragon Knight's Stun range indicator does not change when Dragon Knight enters Dragon Form. Dragon Form changes the cast range, but in order to maximize this, you will be stunning units outside the range indicator.

* Unsure if fixed yet: If you spectate a ranked match, when the game ends, you will see the players' view (showing hidden stats, such as MMR). If you just open a random replay, these stats are hidden.

* Typing for heroes on the hero tab is highly inconsistent. If I type R-I, Timbersaw (aka Rizzrack) will show up. If I type L-A-N, Templar Assassin (aka Lanaya) will not show up. Mortred does not work, and Mirana's names do not work. On the other hand Meepo's does work, and Medusa's does work. Haven't tested too many heroes on this.

* Phantom Lancer can not select illusions during Doppelganger. If you use the skill, then issue a move command, Phantom Lancer will receive it, the illusions will not. This makes it apparent which one is real.

* KDA is overlapping demo mode tools.

* You cannot edit the "Popular Items" menu anymore. (It used to be editable just like a normal guide.)

* In some cases, buying a large item will result in buying too many components. I can't give much more detail than this, but I went to secret shop with 4 OoV, spam clicked skadi, got 4 skadis **and one ulti orb and point booster**, I did not get the other point booster or OoV.

* Buying an item such as Bloodstone or Octarine Core with brown boots may result in building arcanes.

* When viewing an enemy Invoker, the current level of spell stat (like Deafening Blast damage) will be highlighted. This reveals what level Invoker's orb is at.

* Juggernaut ward can be very hard to click if under the hero. This is mostly just a problem with bots.

* You cannot drag an item from stash to shop (to sell). You can drag an item from your inventory/backpack to sell just fine.

* Luna's Eclipse's Alt Text says `There is a .6 seconds gap, .3 seconds with scepter.` Should say `0.6`, `0.3`.

* Hurricane Pike does not change a hero's Attack Acquisition range. For example, if you Hurricane Pick an ethereal unit, you will not begin to auto attack them until the ethereal wears off. If you A-click the ground, you will auto attack the closest enemy within acquisition range. If the enemy is outside your normal attack acquisition range, you will not attack the enemy (despite having infinite range). If you simply click the enemy, you will attack them again.

* Manta illusions seem to lose invulnerability later than the main hero. You can, for example, hit the main hero with Slardar crush without hitting the illusions. Also, if the hero and illusions are within acquisition range, you will auto attack the hero every time.

* Shrine range display disappears when activated. 

*  if you have components for an item in your inventory and enough money to finish it, the item is not highlighted in the shop.  

*  sometimes when you try to select another unit it keeps selecting your unit and you can't see the items the other hero have


* Centaur Ult damage is amped by the allys damage amp, the tooltip shows Centaurs (may or may not be intended).

* If arcana is equipped, during the street fighter VS screen, TB would just stand idle-ly there, whilst without arcana, he is shown crossing his swords.


* When your ally picked tb without an arcana and you swap with him (you have arcana equipped), your hero will be shown using your ally's set(intended), however your illusion will have arcana equipped and they wont have attack animations.


* Infused raindrop does not state whether the 50-120 value is before or after reductions. It is before.

* Phantom Assassin's dagger does not show cast range in description. This is a problem as leveling the ability changes the cast range.

* When you have an item in quick-buy, you cannot press the hotkey to buy that item; it seems to always buy a TP scroll instead.

* Zeus's Level 25 talent upgrade says that it increases static field damage by 1.5% but it shows 1% increase in the skill description.

* [Nature's Prophet's Sprout trees, trees from iron branch and the trees monkey king can transfrom into are not enlarged in showcase mode.](http://i.imgur.com/nvyHrsn.png)

* You can no longer alt+click on enemies buffs/debuffs in the side unit panel and you can't see their stats.

* [Level 25 talents that give charges to non-charge abilities (gyro, aa) use level 1 cooldown for charge recover time for rest of game after 1 recover.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX3Ouejny3Q)

* Gyrocopter's Homing missile talent says +3 homing missile but the total is 3 instead of 4. Also no cooldown showed for homing missile if you chose that talent.

* [First blood kills, Camps stacked stats error](http://imgur.com/u2gBS42)

* if Weaver swarms your Astral Spirit as well as Elder Titan, after Spirit comes back you'll have two of the bugs from the swarm on you.

* Familiars don't display any silence icons when silenced

* Familiars get stuck on the edge of the map and require stone form to get them out.

* [The courier also does not have an upgrade ability in shop](http://imgur.com/a/wM9Oi)

* Aether lens increases the cast range of boundless strike, but not the actual distance the staff hits, meaning targeting someone with it at max distance won't actually hit them.

* Tree dance only applies the highlighting once, it doesn't highlight trees that regrow after entering a tree, and it doesn't reapply highlighting if cast range changes.

* Tree dance highlights the tree you're in until you try to jump to it, then it's correctly unhighlighted.

* Iron Talon: Trying to use its active ability on ancient creeps gives the error "can only be used on trees and wards", which is the quelling blade error message. It should simply say "cannot be used on ancient creeps".

* Visage: If you level up your ultimate your currently summoned familiars should level up after using stone form but they don't. (This one is pretty big considering the cooldown is so long and you don't wanna waste it just to get lvl 2 familiars for example)

* Familiars auto attack. (They should not auto attack by default)

* [Status effects do not show the green or red circle around them or their duration.](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/197428545633687522/72DB5884F94C9500A3D1229F0B2B12028547C0A3/)

* Showcase mode toggle button displays your hero in showcase mode if clicked on a portrait of a different allied unit.

* If a Techies affected by Slark's pounce uses Blast Off and before he impacts the ground the pounce debuff ends, no Blast Off damage is dealt to techies and no silence/damage in the radius.

* [Overlapping hud with control groups](http://imgur.com/a/2Kdgt)

* [If you buy Dagon recipe Lv.4, Quick buy slot will be reset after courier sent it to you.](https://i.redd.it/sqllydnm9o4y.gif)

* Wraith King's Vampric Aura lifesteals incorrect values it should lifesteal 10/15/20/25 (30/35/40/45)% but actually lifesteals at 7.7/13.7/19.7/25.7 (27.7/33.7/39.7/45.7)%. It also applies lifesteal BEFORE armour and attack reductions for allies of Wraith King but does so AFTER armour and attack reductions on Wraith King himself. Finally if Rubick steals Vampiric Aura and dies while he still has the skill stolen and steals it again he and his allies gain 2x the benefit while the skill is toggled.
Morphling's Hybrid appears to also have the same bug

* ["Display Network Information" doesnt show in game](http://i.imgur.com/OLSwNAI.png)

* [Heroes killed by Techies' mines while under WK's Aghs Aura is still counted as a deny.](https://gfycat.com/ShabbyDesertedAcaciarat)

* Everytime Ancient Apparition appears from the fog, he keeps on shattering and this is super annoying, same bug happens with Enigma's black hole and wisp.

* Venomancer and Shadow Shaman's wards do not keep their hotkey binds. 

* [Can't connect to AD matches.](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=274471)

* [There is a missing HERO_NAME string in the hero stats page, "Most recent 20 games" section(above the win loss sequence)](https://i.redditmedia.com/NbSYEOFSrHJm0KDr--lhswosL5uxZfBtns0uC7WR96w.jpg?w=1024&s=df9ceb47e1ecac1f557f9c25321e9057)


* [Batrider's "Mask of the Marauding Pyro" has clipping issues.](http://i.imgur.com/hGG42Xo.png)

* If you use Legacy Keys on Invoker (legacy keys is irrelevant here, but I'll mention it anyway) and rebind Chat Wheel to some other key (I have it to F3) and you press Y (default chat wheel key) it will still bring up chat wheel even though it is not bound to that.
Same thing happens with inventory. If you press Z, the game will use the item in the first inventory slot (I think it's the first one) regardless of your keybinds.

* You can see if an enemy places a ward in FoG because the ward disappears in their inventory. (If he is still selected while he's going to FoG )


* When Monkey King is channelling Primal Spring, Chronosphere doesn't stop him.

* [You can't swap heroes if you buy courier during strategy time because courier is auto used.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5iw75t/you_cant_swap_heroes/ )

* You can't commend effigies anymore.

* Rubick is visible while on the tree, with the tree dance ability stolen from Monkey King if you are close to the tree.

* Rubick does not get the flying vision or indicator for trees he can jump to, he can also use Tree Dance on the ground even while damaged in the normal damage window.

* When watching a game if you try to press buttons like "Y" for net worth nothing will happen and you have to click on it to change.

* You get 4 commends instead of one every time someone commends you.

* Reverse camera grip has been broken for years. It doesn't root the cursor to the ground like standard camera grip so it feels janky and gives you way less range of movement than standard grip.

___

#Ability Draft

* In Ability Draft, heroes sometimes retain their original ultimate, allowing for the hero to have 2 ultimate abilities.

* Zeus and treant retain their ultimates if they select another ult totalling 5 abilities. hitting r will activate their normal while the bonus ultimate needs to be clicked on directly.

* Nyx assassin gains burrow when purchasing an aghs but it will not activate. also causes your current ultimate to take the 4th slot and require clicking to activate. ultimate hotkey will not work after purchasing.

* Keyboard hotkeys do NOT work in draft screen (no voice chat, impossible to draft if you cant communicate)

* Tome of knowledge XP increase per Tome used does NOT work

* Couriers and wards regularly error out.

* Using metamorphosis in ability draft does not give you extra range, even on terrorblade.

#**[DotaTV and replay 7.00 bugs](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=274309)** (link to dev forum with screenshots)

* No single HUD console command currently is working in live games and replays, it's also impossible to hide different parts of HUD: map, heroes picked, inventory. You can toggle only full HUD and only in replays (not in live games) with this command hud_toggle_visibility 0

* Broadcasters stats option doesn't work when watching leagues live matches and leagues replays

* If you scroll replay's timeline during fight, when multi-kill banner appears, it doesn't disappear until you restart replay

* After selecting casters during picks/bans phase in league live game you can't open viewer's panel until picks/ban phase is over

* Hotkeys don't work in replays of tournament matches (decrease/increase speed, pause) and in live games, especially in tournament games (stats dropdown hotkeys, selecting heroes with numbers and ESC button). That mostly happens when you select caster and then you can't use hotkeys to change dropdown stats like before for example. But if you click with mouse somewhere on the map (not minimap), creep for example, hotkeys will work again. If you select different caster, hotkeys will stop working again.

* If caster reconnected to the game, you need to restart client to hear him again, you can't just deselect him and select again.

* In casted games Directed Camera is set by default when you chose language of caster, instead of using this caster's camera control, directed camera is used. You need to switch it manually

* No streamers audio after using live rewind during live stream (bug exists since Dota Reborn release, didn't exist in original Dota 2) 

* No timestamps when you hover mouse over timeline both in replays and live games. Timestamps were before and it was useful 
* "X users got prize for witnessing *event-name*" messages appear in the mid of the screen, in pre-7.00 era it appeared in the left bottom corner with kills log

* Cooldowns of old replays are broken after scrolling timeline

* FPS/Ping panel on Spectator Mode overrides spectator controls (Net worth chart, XP chart, close button, etc.)

* While spectating;(free camera); you can't double click a hero portrait on top to move camera to that hero

Enough is enough, we need IO fixed because I'm running into so many problems playing him every time. It's ruining everyone's game with an IO involved and I feel like it shouldn't be ignored any longer.|self.DotA2|~Edit: Hey /r/all if anyone that doesn't know what Dota 2 is, please check [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/wiki/faq#wiki_what_are_some_basic_tips_when_starting_to_play.3F) out

After all the post 7.00 posts have cooled down I think this is an appropriate time to bring this issue back to light.

It was so ridiculous looking at all the new changes in the 7.00 update and not seeing any crucial IO fixes pop up ONCE. Many of us IO pickers feel completely neglected and to be honest I feel pretty butthurt about all this since many other heroes are getting the fixes they need but these IO game-breaking problems have persisted since IO's release. 

---

#Spell Interactions:

I'll start off with the most serious problem, IO's particle effects while interacting with other hero spells are **very** broken, for example, when Pugna decriptifies IO, instead of looking green, IO completely disappears... This visual information is very essential to the game and I don't want to completely rely on looking down at my buffs/debuffs bar instead of my actual game when playing IO because the actual game contains much more visual information than the debuff bar at the bottom of the screen (obviously), to help people know the importance of this problem I detailed all 42 of these bugs in a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BIyCijXuTX3H8CSFlO2ZBQdbo1W-21OTmVBmjaHOIds/edit?usp=sharing), made by testing every single tedious spell interaction from every hero when coming into contact with IO

I hope people who pick heroes other than IO can sympathize with me on this because IO is the only hero that has spell interaction bugs and if you think that this lack of visual information is not a big deal then by this logic we should also be okay with Dota 2 becoming a plain board game, right?

The amazing /u/Toyoka commented on this explaining the cause of this problem and their possible solutions to me, here is what he had to say:

>Most of these issues are caused by Io being entirely particle-based. Particles are very finicky when it comes to applying them over each other. It looks like some of the strobing/flickering that goes on is caused due to [z-fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting) because Io's particles are trying to render over other things, while effect particles from spells are also trying to do the same. It's not easy to fix, but it is doable. I experienced this myself while working on an [Io set of mine](https://streamable.com/r5je) and the best way to solve it is to just balance out how the particles are rendered. I do sincerely hope Valve does some work on Io, it would make people like you and me happy :)

#Relocate Timer:

This is a problem that has been the ultimate cause of my death countless of times, it's almost impossible to pull off a glimmer cape TP back after relocating after the timer without timing it right when you get hit by [Monkey King](http://imgur.com/a/sUG7b). What also makes it worse is the buffs bar doesn't show the [timer](http://imgur.com/a/bUwm3) and that **really** grinds my gears.

/u/Toyoka explained the cause of this bug and suggested a temporary solution but I don't think that's enough for a huge game like Dota 2: Edit: (KINDA OUTDATED)

>Yea, this is an issue with the particle's alignment and could easily be fixed by a dev by adjusting its offset by a few units. One way to remedy this yourself (albeit not a permanent solution, of course) is to move your camera up slightly when relocating so the timer is more visible, since it's visibility is partially dependent on the camera's angle. The timer in general is sort of a bad implementation in my opinion; for example, it completely gets wonky when in showcase view, as it's meant to be seen from the default camera angle.

---

I know it sounds very cliche but fuck karma and fuck popularity, while they are nice things that I like to have and enjoy; the sole reason of making this post is in the hopes that one day we'll wake up to a brand new Dota 2 update that fixes these bugs and doesn't make us feel like we're at a disadvantage in every single game as IO, us the IO picking community and many others have banded together before for #GiffIoArcana and it was a very valiant and beautiful effort, but this time, it's not for a cosmetic purpose, it's for maintaining our reputation as the best MOBA game in our time, and to proudly say that, we need our playable characters to be fully functional. In spirit of reincarnating a small scale and short lived hashtag of comments on my previous, not very well known IO bug posts: **#PRAYFORIO**

Thank you for taking the time to read my huge wall of text about IO bugs but if you didn't, here's a **TL;DR:**

IO has many bugs that are always seen in games with IOs in them that drastically affect the game and these bugs need to be fixed ASAP. Thanks for caring anyways!

*I'll relocate out now*

Edit: Thanks to everyone who helped this get visibility, I hope that by next patch this problem will only be a memory.~|bug

Proof that the Song of the Siren + Meteor Hammer combo is not working 100% of the time|self.DotA2|~There have been some debates on whether this combo always works or not. Here is a definite answer to that:

No, it is not 100% reliable and does not work consistently.


**TL;DR: The combo sometimes does not hit every unit within the area, for reasons  beyond the player's control. Factors that seemingly make the combo fail at times are: Game time (meaning which game tick the combo lands on) and amount of units on the map. Unit creation order may play a role as well.**


Why is this?

Well, everyone who uses the combo (probably) knows that the song's linger time and the meteor landing time are the same: 0.5 seconds. If you do the combo, it's 2 things happening on the same tick. There is literally 0 delay between the song ending and the meteor hitting.

And this is what makes the combo not 100% reliable. I cannot tell you why it happens, but sometimes, the orders get swapped around on these frame-perfect events, if the order is not determined by some factor (e.g. by the spell codes, like deso, which will always place its debuff before the attack damage is applied, both on the same frame). Since these are 2 spells being used together, there is no such factor determining the order.

The strange part is, if you have multiple enemies within the meteor area, sometimes, only some of them may get hit. This I cannot explain at all. It just shows us that it goes through every unit one by one, but for some reason, swaps the order around for some units.

In the video, you can see how the combo only hits 1 out of the 5 enemy nagas, but when the enemies do it, they hit 3 out of 5 nagas. After I spawned the naga illus, it suddenly hit every single one of them.

ACTUAL list of unfixed bugs from 6.87 (including some abusable stuff)|self.DotA2|~As expected, u/TheZett only covered Arc Warden bugs. There are more bugs which spawned with 6.87, and most of them are covered here (except for AW bugs). Some of them are abusable (although not gamebreaking like the infinite axe taunt)

This turned out longer than expected. Whatever.

Edit: Also, something something Decrepify Tombstone not working something.

#**Untouchable malfunction caused by canceling attacks**

This is not a 6.87 bug, but it is abusable, so here it goes: When you directly target Enchantress with an attack order, and then cancel that order so that your hero starts automatically attacking Enchantress, it will not be slowed by Untouchable and attack at normal speed. There are 2 ways to do this. Either have auto-attack set to "always" and simply press Stop once during the ordered attack. Or you have auto-attack off and give your unit an attack-ground order during the ordered attack.

**Current:** Untouchable does not slow when auto-attacking ench after a forced attack.

**Expected:** Untouchable always slows, no matter how the attack started.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAYQ2mPb5bE

#This is not properly fixed yet, it still is abusable like before.

----

~~~~#**Echo Sabre always grants its effects on the first hit after picking it up**~~~~

~~~~This is heavily abusable. Whenever your Echo Sabre enters your inventory (be it freshly bought, or just dropped on the ground and then picked upa gain), it will apply its attack speed and slow on your next attack, regardless of its cooldown.~~~~

~~~~**Current:** Echo Sabre always applying its effects on the first attack after pickup.~~~~

~~~~**Expected:** Echo Sabre only applies its effects upon succesfully hitting an enemy.~~~~

~~~~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2Qh5XeFl7w~~~~

~~~~Besides the enchantress example, it can be abused in every situation. Whenever it is save to do so, you can drop and quickly pick it up to get 2 very fast attacks, instead of 1 normal speed attack and 1 very fast attack.~~~~

Fixed

----

#**Fury Swipes damage not reflected/spread by Blade Mail/Dispersion/Fatal Bonds**

For some reason, damage dealt by Fury Swipes is ignored by spells which ignore damage which have the no-reflection flag.

**Current:** Damage dealt by Fury Swipes is ignored by Blade Mail/Fatal Bonds/Dispersion.

**Expected:** Like before 6.87, Fury Swipes damage is fully affected by all 3.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf2J6tcqCbM

----

~~~~#**Arctic Burn doesn't toggle itself off when dropping the aghs**~~~~

~~~~This can be abused in the late game. When you buy aghs, toggle Arctic Burn on, and then drop the aghs (e.g. put in stash), Arctic Burn will remain toggled on until you die. This basically enables WW to have 6 items + an aghs effect in the late game (effectively 7 slots).~~~~

~~~~**Current:** Arctic Burn stays toggled on after dropping aghs.~~~~

~~~~**Expected:** Arcitc Burn toggles itself off as soon as aghs gets dropped.~~~~

~~~~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD4Pm4CW8kc~~~~

Fixed

----

~~~~#**Aghs upgraded Arctic Burn procs stuff like magic wand**~~~~

~~~~The aghs upgrade turns Arctic Burn into a toggle spell. As a toggle spell, it should not proc magic wand/stick/arcane curse/last word and other spells which react on spell-cast. As of now, it does, as the only toggle spell in the game. It should proc them when not upgraded.~~~~

~~~~**Current:** Toggling Arctic Burn on/off procs on-cast effects.~~~~

~~~~**Expected:** Arctic Burn should not proc on-cast effects when upgraded, like other toggle spells. It should only proc them when not upgraded.~~~~

~~~~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rnqTxEC5-k~~~~

Fixed

----

~~~~#**Tidebringer's cast range is still 128, instead of 150**~~~~

~~~~Melee attack range was increased to 150. But Tidebringer's cast range is still 128, so when you use it manually, Kunkka will have to move a bit closer to the target.~~~~

~~~~**Current:** Tidebringer cast range is 128.~~~~

~~~~**Expected:** Tidebringer cast range is 150.~~~~

~~~~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm1lMyBaDxw~~~~

Fixed, except for the range indicators (all 3 still show 128, instead of 150)

Also, besides Tidebringer, **the range indicator of Walrus Punch (and Walrus Kick) are not updated**. Although their cast range was updated to 150, the indicator still shows 128.

----
~~~~#**Walrus Punch lost its True Strike in 6.87**~~~~

~~~~Just like Silver Edge, which was fixed quickly, Walrus Punch has lost its True Strike. This hurts Tusk a lot against heroes like PA, making him unable to deal with them like before.~~~~

~~~~**Current:** Walrus Punch does not have True Strike and can miss.~~~~

~~~~**Expected:**  Walrus Punch has True Strike and cannot miss.~~~~

~~~~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjHjT9FJZ9U~~~~

This got fixed

----

#**Hurricane Pike's buff does not update properly on re-cast**

When you re-cast Hurricane Pike while having the buff from a previous cast, the buff duration gets refreshed. But the number of limitless range attacks is not refreshed, and the target is not updated either.

So let's say you cast it on hero A and make 2 attacks on it. You now have 2 unlimited range attacks against that target left. Now, recast it on hero B. You still have 2 unlimited range attacks left against target A and have 0 unlimited range attacks against target B. All the recast did is refresh the previous buff without updating it at all.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nFjD4rYIWI

**Current:** Recasting Pike only refreshes buff duration

**Expected:** Recasting Pike refreshes duration, updates target for unlimited range attacks and resets number of attacks to 4.

----

#**Hurricane Pike (and Force Staff) pushes units too far**

According to tooltips and changelogs, Hurricane Pike should push units 450 range away from each other. However, it actually pushes them 525 range away from each other.

http://i.imgur.com/az4jOSK.jpg

**Current:** Hurricane Pike pushes caster & enemy units 525 range.

**Expected:** Hurricane Pike pushes caster & enemy units 450 range.

Same applies to targeting self/allies, or using Force Staff. They should push for 600 range, but actually push 650 range.

http://i.imgur.com/wvg5WUn.jpg

**Current:** Force Staff and Hurricane Pike push units 650 range.

**Expected:** Force Staff and Hurricane Pike push units 600 range.

----

#**Hurricane Pike places its range buff on melee casters**

**Edit:** As pointed out by u/utumo , this is actually a good thing for morphing heroes who can switch between ranged/melee (troll, lone, dk, terrorblade), so maybe this is a good thing and shouldn't be changed.


Just a minor visual/information issue. When the item is used by a melee hero, or reflected by a melee hero, it should not place the unlimited range buff on them, since they cannot make use of it anyway.

**Current:** Hurricane Pike places its unlimited range buff on melee casters.

**Expected:** Hurricane Pike does not place its unlimited range buff on melee casters.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leKkdr4MBA8

----

#**Desolator/Blight Stone place their debuff on ethereal units**

I checked *all* other attack modifier, and deso/blight are the only ones which do this.

Since 6.87 attack projectiles no longer apply secondary effects (like debuffs or extra magical damage or whatever) on their targets when they connect with it while it is in ethereal state. Howeve, Desolator and Blight Stone still place their debuffs even when their target turned ethereal.

**Current:** Desolator/Blight Stone apply their debuff when connecting with ethereal targets.

**Expected:** Desolator/Blight Stonedo not apply their debuff when connecting with ethereal targets.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t1KyB3zCgc

----

#**Bane's Nightmare broken interaction with dispels**

Since 6.87, Nightmare is dispellable. However, there are 2 issues

**1.** Nightmare's sleep effect is *always* placed as a debuff, no matter if the target is an ally or enemy. This means when you face an enemy Bane, you cannot use your purge to remove the defensive Nightmare, which defeats the purpose of turning the spell dispellable. Strangely, the invulnerability effect works properly (buff when cast on allies, debuff when cast on enemies).

http://i.imgur.com/W1mXkUC.png

**Current**: Nightmare is always placed as a debuff, regardless of who is targeted.

**Expected**: Nightmare is placed as a buff when casting on allies, and debuff when on enemies.

**2.** Nightmare's invulnerability effect is unpurgeable

This means, even when you purge the Nightmare off, you will still be invulnerable for the 1 second. This matters since Diffusal Blade and Satyr Purge can target invulnerable units

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3qEGaSfqI0

----

~~~~#**Recasting Pipe of Insight (or Flame Guard) doesn't reset damage block capacity**~~~~

~~~~Since Pipe of Insight no longer has a stack restriction, this got relevant (it always was somewhat relevant for Ember Spirit).~~~~

~~~~When you cast Pipe and have it block some magical damage, and then recast it while still having the previous buff, it only refreshes the duration, but does not set its damage block capacity back. Same goes for Ember Spirit's Flame Guard.~~~~

~~~~Hood of Defiance's active ability had the same issue as it was added, but it was fixed. Pipe and Flame Guard were not fixed.~~~~

~~~~**Current:** Recasting Pipe/Flame Guard only refreshes buff duration.~~~~

~~~~**Expected:** Recasting them also resets their damage block capacity.~~~~

~~~~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_E529J4tW0~~~~

Fixed

----

#**Drunken Brawler's ensured crit gets wasted on attack-canceling**

This does not happen always. It happens when you cancel your attacks few times quickly. The ensured crit should only get used up if you succesfully land an attack (it already ignores missed attacks). This used to work fine before 6.87.

**Current:** Canceling attacks may cause the ensured crit to get wasted

**Expected:** Ensured crit only goes on cooldown when it actually succesfully hits an enemy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuB74uitV1k

You can see that the icon updates properly (red streak disappears upon succesful hit), but you can see that the attack does not crit.

----

#**Gyro's side gunner ignores fade time/fade delay of invis spells**

This prevents Gyro from turning invisible with Moonlight Shadow, as the gunner's attacks will reset the fade delay. It also is abusable with Shadow Blade. When timing Shadow Blade so that the gunner attacks during the fade time, the attack will apply the backstab without using up the invis. So you can backstab a 2nd time with one cast by breaking the invis with a regular attack.

**Current:** The side gunner keeps attacking during the fade time or fade delay on invis spells

**Expected:**The gunner should not attack during fade times/delays (nerfing solution), or, the gunner's attack should not reset fade delays (buffing solution)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ3nobWWGAg

----

~~~~#**Spirit Siphon's sound and visual effect do not match its duration**~~~~

~~~~The visual effect and sound effect of Spirit Siphon still last only 4 seconds (original duration as the spell was added). By now, its duration was increased to 6, but the visuals/sounds were never updated. So 1/3 of its duration, the spell is basically invisible.~~~~

~~~~**Current:** Spirit Siphon visuals/sounds last 4 seconds.~~~~

~~~~**Expected:** Spirit Siphon visuals/sounds last the full 6 seconds.~~~~

~~~~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLthnABeWzs~~~~

~~~~Also, **Spirit Siphon's visual effect draws to the center of the map** when having no vision over the target. This used to not be a problem as it used to provide shared vision, but now it is.~~~~

~~~~**Current:** Spirit Siphon visuals draw to map center when losing vision over target.~~~~

~~~~**Expected:** Spirit Siphon visuals draw to target's current location when losing vision over it.~~~~

Ritsu strikes again - DODGING EXPLOIT|self.DotA2|~Hey reddit, i just made an account to post this because what happened with this "pro" player was enfuriating from my point of view.

I maybe should introduce myself, I am a 6.8k player atm, [pics or didnt happen](http://imgur.com/XmYCtOZ) , I was queueing for an hour long a solo ranked game, queue popped, got into a game yada yada yada. I always kind of check who am i playing against, hence I recognized one of the players I was going to play against was Ritsu (a pro player playing for Dragneel atm that has recieved a lot of accusations for: stalking beesa's sister, [showing scrim picks to other teams on skype](https://twitter.com/EternaLEnVy1991/status/663175361790898177) , etc) So everyone was loading into the game aswell as Ritsu and I realised that he dced from it after few seconds of being loaded into it. That's fine I have done it to avoid a headache once in a while. The problem is that he EXPLOITED a bug to not get the qeue ban time and keep queueing and he can do it over and over again until he likes his team. I got him in my qeues like 3 times and he wasted like 2 hours of my time queueing abusing this exploit because I kept getting into a game against him over and over.

[WHAT DID HE DO?](/tg) : he timed (chronometer or smth) the amount of time he was dced for and came back at the very moment the game goes into that FAILED (in red) phase where u wait 3 seconds before you get back into a qeue. The game dealt with this like if a player didnt load and starts the queue again for all the 9 players and gives a cooldown to the player/s that didnt load, in this case its for the 10 players because hes exploiting this bug. That way you dont get a cooldown from competitive timer.

[DO I HAVE PROOF?](/tg) : I didnt have proof the first time he did it, but then I got in queue against him 2 more times and he did it again, so here are some images about it. [qeued against him](http://imgur.com/Uq05s7T) , [moment when he has to RC so that he doesnt get the cooldown](http://imgur.com/r0iqxOZ) , [great conversation with a great human](http://imgur.com/BnxXUhK)

I took this time to create an account and post it because I have played several times with and against this guy in ranked games and hes constantly flaming people, being extremely racist (unbelievable), a game ruiner and guess what! now hes a bug exploiter aswell. Hope this guy never gets to play professional dota again, he just disgraces everything what a pro player should be in my opinion. Valve please fix this (i also hope u take some actions against the player/s that are abusing the bug) since it is really unfair for every other player that is not abusing it.

TL;DR: ritsu exploited a bug to not get queue time cooldowns after dodging and since hes fucking all my queues (about 2 hrs of time) i took almost the same amount of time to expose him and report a bug.

P.S: i know u know who i am ritsu pls no family stalking xD~|bug

#1.Borrowed Time scepter upgrade malfunctions and may cause performance issues.

Borrowed Time's scepter upgrade adds an aura to it which lingered for 0.5 seconds on allies. This lingering caused a suicide bug on Abaddon when allies took damage after Borrowed Time expired on him, so he took the 50% damage without turning into a heal. To fix this issue, the devs set its buff linger duration to 0.

This turns out to be a bad solution, because it causes other severe issues:

* The aura's effect may not apply to the hero on several server ticks because of how fast it gets removed again. This means your aghs sometimes does nothing but increase duration!
* It spams the heroes with the buff multiple times per tick, which may or may not affect performance (I need help checking this)
* The buff stays invisible on allies, since it never gets the chance to establish due to it being spammed.

Video demos: [aura malfunctioning] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPXrMrzmfzw), [buff spamming] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6pCkcFE27g) and [buff not being visible] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhBdesuiSc4)

Note: None of these existed before its linger duration was set to 0, so it is save to assume that all 3 issues are caused by it.

**Proposed solution:**

* Make the aura use the default 0.5s buff linger duration again
* Add codes to Borrowed Time which destroys the modifier_abaddon_borrowed_time_damage_redirect modifier on all affected allied heroes as soon as the borrowed_time modifier disappears on Abaddon

---

#2. Aphotic Shield malfunction when combined with Borrowed Time aura or Ghostship rum

Aphotic Shield does not block any damage when the unit is also affected by Borrowed Time's aura or by Ghost Ship's rum, but it still lose capacity as if it did block.

**Current behavior:** For simplicity's sake, let's take a dagon 5 and say it deals 500 damage:

* Dagon 5 alone: 500 damage
* Dagon 5 on Aphotic Shield: 300 damage, 200 blocked by shield
* Dagon 5 on aura/rum: 250 damage, 500 reduced by 50%
* Dagon5 on shield+aura/rum: still 250 damage? reduced by 50%, but shield did nothing and still bursted as if it did

**Expected behavior:** There are 2 options:

* Option 1: damage\*aura/rum-shield = 500\*0.5-200=50
* Option 2: (damage-shield)\*0.5 = 500-200\*0.5 = 150

Option one would be more consistant, with Borrowed Time taking priority over Aphotic Shield. In option 2, Aphotic Shield takes priority.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq0WNrG6D_Y) As seen in the vid, Living Armor has the same issue.

---

#3.Aphotic Shield malfunction when combined with Living Armor

Similar to the previous case. When a unit is affected by Aphotic Shield and Living Armor at the same time, **this currently happens:**

* Living Armor functions normally, blocks damage loses a charge per instance
* However, Aphotic Shield still loses health as if Living Armor did not block any damage.
* To make things worse, Aphotic Shield itself does not block any damage while having Living Armor. So it loses health but does nothing.

**Expected happenings:** 2 options again:

* Option 1: Living Armor blocks damage and loses charge, Aphotic Shield blocks remaining damage and loses capacity based on how much it blocked.
* Option 2: Aphotic Shield blocks first. Living Armor therefore has nothing to block and keeps all its charges until Aphotic Shield is destroyed, at which point Living Armor can start blocking.

#4.Aphotic Shield's visual effect is tiny/invisible on some heroes and units

Aphotic Shield's visual effect size is based on the model. But some model have attachment issues, making the bubble extremely small or attach the bubble at bad spots, so that it's basically invisible on some heroes and units.

[Here are some examples in a video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHY6Ok2-sc8) showing the worst cases.

**Worst cases are:** Tiny, Drow Ranger, Broodmother, Gyrocopter, Riki, Viper, Weaver, Naga Siren, burrowed Nyx Assassin, Dier Siege Creep, Kobold Foreman/Taskmaster, Beastmaster's hawk, Roshan and Undying Zombie Torsos.

**More bad cases are:** Earthshaker, Underlord, Undying, Phoenix, Sand King, Ember Spirit, Medusa, Razor, Nyx, Oracle, Techies, Leshrac, Ogre Magi and Winter Wyvern.

Wisp also has an issue, the shield flickers heavily on it.

[Here is an image showing the shield on all heroes] (http://i.imgur.com/itpbSIT.jpg), including their transformations, and [here on all non-hero units] (http://i.imgur.com/gjJpGAA.jpg).

**Proposed fix:** Most of these could be fixed by giving the shield a minimum size. As a comparison, Lotus Orb's Echo Shell does not have this issue, so maybe the behavior can be copied from there.

---

#5. Borrowed Time heavy inconsistency upon taking 2 damage instances at once.

Update edit: Mistake on my side, this issue does not affect all the named spells. It affects 7 out of them.

It's strange. If you are low enough that damage can auto-trigger Borrowed Time, and if you take 2 damage instances at once, sometimes Borrowed Time heals from one of them and sometiems it doesn't.

Hard to put into words, so [here is an image showing combat logs] (http://i.imgur.com/DY7eI8d.png)

Affected heroes/spells are:

* Ancient Apparition (Chilling Touch + attack damage)
* Nyx Assassin (Vendetta + attack damage)
* Templar Assassin (Meld + attack damage)
* Batrider (Sticky Napalm + any other damage from bat)
* Outworld Devourer (Arcane Orb + attack damage)
* Storm Spirit (Overload + attack damage)
* Bounty Hunter (Shadow Walk + attack damage)

Other spells which deal 2 instances of damage at once are:

* Earthshaker (Aftershock + Fissure or Echo Slam)
* Spectre (Desolate + attack damage)
* Clinkz (Searing Arrows + attack damage)
* Spirit Breaker (Greater Bash + Nether Strike or attack damage)
* Lich (Frost Blast 2 damage instances on primary target)
* Enchantress (Impetus + attack damage)
* Silencer (Glaives of Wisdom + attack damage)
* Elder Titan (Echo Stomp 2 damage instances)

But these one work as expected. The first instance procs Borrowed Time and the second instance is turned into a heal.

---

#6.Borrowed Time cannot be shift-queued.

Same fate shared with Morphling's Morph, Ursa's scepter upgraded Enrage and Bane's Nightmare End sub-ability.

They all cannot be shift-queued. This is because of this flag they have: 

DOTA_ABILITY_BEHAVIOR_IGNORE_PSEUDO_QUEUE

This is what allows them to be cast while disabled. However, for some reason, it breaks shift-queue for those abilities. It shouldn't do that.

#7.Mist Coil causes the target enemy to suicide if they have Lotus Orb buff on

This is a bullshit interaction which really shouldn't happen.

You want to finish an enemy off with Mist Coil, the enemy is low enough to die to your coil. But the enemy has Echo Shell active from Lotus Orb. What happens instead is, before your Mist Coil applies its damage, Echo Shell reflects it, applying the self-damage, *denying the hero* and then your mist coil applies its damage after the target denied itself.

Why is lotus orb able to apply the spell effect before the original caster's spell applies its effect?

Mist Coil isn't the only spell suffering from this. Many single-target spells have this issue. If a spell is lethal to both of you, you actually die first to the reflected spell, instead of the target to your spell.

I suggest adding a split second delay to the reflecting of the spell. The spell should first be able to apply its effect before being reflected.

#8. Curse of Avernus doesn't grant Abaddon the buff on his first attack vs buildings.

His passive is supposed to buff Abaddon against any non-ward, non-allied target, no matter whether the enemy is debuffed already or not. This works fine against heroes and units, but not against buildings.

The ability can place its debuff on buildings. So Abaddon should get the buff on the first attack against them.

EHOME lost to TNC because of a bug with Ancient Apparition Ult|self.DotA2|~In the match with EHOME against TNC the Anti-Mage died in fountain to Ice Blast when he had a BKB he could have used to prevent this death.

He didn't use the BKB because it was only Level 1 AA Ult which has a 10% kill threshold and he had 1600 HP, although he died when he passed the 14% health threshold. 

He should have died at 160 HP but instead died at 224 HP

Perhaps the level 25 AA talent is actually being applied at all levels?

Hero2: Everything wrong with Alchemist, part 1/2|self.DotA2|~[part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5tbqie/hero2_everything_wrong_with_alchemist_part_22/)

Once a week or every 2 weeks, I'll make a post focusing on a single hero, pointing out every issue I could find (this includes cosmetic items), and also including some suggestions for the hero, mainly quality of life stuff and minor possible improvements.
-

Since no one is perfect, I probably missed some stuff. If you know any other issue about this hero, or have an idea for small improvement (not balancing stuff), feel free to post them
-

Some of these posts will be split up into multiple ones, because else they'll get too long.
-

Also, this post reveals how I'll deal with Rubick. No, I'll not include every bugged spell on the rubick post. I'll include them in the hero's post which the spell belongs to.

#1.Unstable Concoction is blocked/reflected by every Linken's Sphere/Lotus Orb within its area.

This interaction is broken since the aoe targeting cursor was added to Unstable Concoction.

**Repro:**

* Get Lotus Orb and Linken's Sphere
* Stand next to an ally who also has Linken's Sphere and cast Lotus Orb on self
* Have an enemy Alchemist target the ally with Unstable Concoction

**Result:** The concoction is blocked and reflected by your sphere/orb as a secondary target. The ally's Linken's Sphere does not prevent the aoe effect from happening.

**Expected behavior:**Reflected only when primary target. Blocked compeltely, including aoe effect only when primary target. Should behave like how Storm Hammer behaves.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei15jm4zRkI)

----

#2. Unstable Concoction's projectile provides no vision.

Even in 7.00, its vision was acknowledged. It was reduce from 400 to 300. But currently, its vision does not work at all.

**Repro:**

* Throw Unstable Concoction at an enemy
* Have the enemy move inside the fog of war (e.g. blink away)

**Result:** The projectile does not provide any vision as it travels through the fog. It just dsappears. It also doesn't apply lingering vision on impact.

**Expected behavior:** The projectile should provide 300 radius vision around itself and around the target upon impact for 3 seconds.

[From the 7.00 changelog] (http://i.imgur.com/4ZdavV3.png)

[Demo of current behavior] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPnalZR1qp8), no vision is provided at any time.

PS: The vision is broken since the aoe targeting cursor was added to Unstable Concoction.

---

#3. Unstable Concoction can shuffle Rubick's ability positions

This is only an issue when Rubick has Aghanim's Scepter, since only then the cooldown realistically allows you to repro it. Or some weird combo with octarine core, arcane rune and chakra magic, or a refresher.

**Repro:**

* Steal Unstable Concoction
* Start brewing
* While brewing, steal another spell
* While still brewing, re-steal Unstable Concoction

**Result:** The concoction doesn't fully cancel upon losing the spell. It blows up on Rubick, but it's still brewing, and even displays the timer above Rubick still. When you don't re-steal it, the timer just runs out and nothing happens. But when you re-steal it before that, it blows up a second time upon reaching 0, and then shuffles your ability positions.

**Expected behavior:** As soon as Rubick loses the concoction spell, it should *fully* cancel. The timer should disappear, it should stop brewing. So there is no chance for this shuffling to happen when re-stealing it.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzPKWkE7R7Y)

---
#4. Aghanim's Scepter Synth buff doesn't grant its stats to illusions

**Repro:**

* Pick Alchemist and get Manta Style
* Buy Aghanim's Scepter and infuse it into yourself
* Create illus and check their stats/hp/mana

**Current behavior:** Your illus have less stats/hp/mana than you, but they do copy the synth buff. If you just manta with the aghs in the inventory, they obviously copy the item and all its stats normally.

**Expected behavior:** Illus should gain the stats/hp/mana from the Aghanim's Scepter Synth buff like how they do when copying Aghanim's Scepter as an item.

[video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHUOAc5RIeY)

---

#5.Unstable Concoction doesn't apply aoe effect when blowing up on self while invulnerable/hidden

This is an inconistancy with the spell. When your targeted enemy hero turns invulnerable or hidden, it does apply the aoe effect still. But if it blows up on yourself while invulnerable or hidden, no aoe effect is applied.

**Repro:**

* Start brewing Unstable Concoction
* Position yourself close to an enemy hero
* Before it blows up, turn invulnerable (e.g. Eul's)
* Compare the behavior when throwing it and the target turns invulnerable before impact

**Result:** The aoe effect is not applied when blowing up on self. Aoe effect is applied when impacting the target.

**Expected behavior:** It should always apply its aoe effect, no matter whether thrown or not. It should hit enemies around alch even when Alch is invulnerable.

PS: This interaction is also broken since the aoe targeting cursor was added to it.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YHUOGNbx_w)

---

#6. Reflecting Unstable Concoction while brewing one cancels the brewing

A scenario which is currently only possible vs Rubick.

**Repro:**

* Get a Lotus Orb
* Have an enemy Rubick steal Unstable Concoction
* Start brewing your concoction and put Lotus Orb buff on self
* Get hit by the enemy Rubick's Concoction

**Result:** Your brewing cancels as soon as you are hit by it. The reflected concoction stuns and damages based on how long you brewed.

**Expected:** Your brewing should continue normally. The reflected concoction's damage/stun should be based on how long Rubick brewed his concoction.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZLZA09Wl5I)

---

#7. Recasting Unstable Concoction resets the damage/stun of the projectile of the previous cast

A scenario possible with Refresher, or with Octarine Core/Arcane Rune and Chakra Magic.

**Repro:**

* Cast Unstable concoction, and brew it for full duration
* Throw the max brewed concoction at an enemy
* While the projectile flies, start brewing a new concoction

**Result:** The projectile, although fully brewed, damages and stuns based on your second cast's brew time, so it basically deals very little damage and mini-stuns.

**Expected behavior:** The casts should be all independent. A new cast should not reset the previous cast.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Apquo7mCo)

---

#8. Greevil's Greed does not proc against the Tempest Double

**Repro:**

* Level up Greevil's Greed
* Kill a Tempest Double

**Result:** No extra gold is granted, no stack is added to Greevil's Greed.

**Expected:** Extra gold should be granted and a stack should be added.

The ability tooltip states that it works against any unit that grants gold. The double does grant bold since I don't remember which patch added it. So it should work with Greed now.

PS: Illus have a bounty now, too. Should it work against those as well?

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BX2KQkJVGM)

---

#9. Unstable Concoction can't target, but can hit creep-heroes

Some strange inconsistancy. It can only target heroes. But its aoe effect can hit heroes and creep-heroes.

It should either:

* Be able to target creep-heroes as well, or
* Do not creep-heroes within its area.

Or a buff: Make it hit all creeps within its area.

Drow Rangers Silence duration is still 6 seconds - The Dev team has buffed Drow Rangers old Silence spell instead|self.DotA2|~Long story short:

Drow Rangers Talent now affects her old AoE silence spell, instead of her new "wave of silence" spell (the one with the knockback).

Additionally Drow Ranger does not use her silence spell voice lines, when she uses her new silence. She does use them with the old spell, though.

The voice lines should be hooked up to the new spell, so she uses them with her new silence spell instead.

[Video of bug reproduced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL3-XBBrMHM)

Weave cancels the sound and animation of ghost scepter.  Particularly annoying in the in-game scenario, as we crowded around the 1 HP stunned Magnus because ranged heroes will go to melee range if targeting a ghost scepter, only to get RP'd...

Does Weave "disguise" any other abilities?  Obviously the buff affect is still visible.

EDIT: I've tested on a bunch of things. Weave is the only one I've found so far.  Even decrepify from Pugna doesn't duplicate it. E-blade *does* have the same bug, though.

Actually, having Weave on EVER disguises it, which is a much bigger problem. [Video of that here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTGytiYloGw).~|bug

* Armor Corruption
* Cleave

I have an idea for this, we can have 10 slots with each of them representing one of the attacking modifiers, if hero grants one attacking modifier the slot for that is on and if not the slot is grayed out. And when cursor is on slots we get a proper title and full description for them. And we also need to add burn damage to these slots.

**And other known issues:**

* **Alchemist  Greevils Greed buff**  
Add duration (After 30 seconds of not killing a unit which gives golds, the buff loses bonus, well then we need a duration on buff.)

* **Arc Warden  Flux debuff**  
Description says Slowed by 50% when not near a friendly unit, but when there is a friendly unit nearby it says slowed by 0% when not near a friendly unit.

* **Axe  Battle Hunger buff**  
Add duration

* **Beastmaster  Wild Axes debuff**  
Has a duration but there is no duration attribute in ability tooltip.

* **Bloodseeker  Thirst buff**  
When enemy hero gains health even if its still below 75% of max hp, Bloodseeker loses the buff which says "Movement speed and attack speed increased".

* **Bristleback  Talents  +6 Max Goo Stacks**  
The ability Goo gets 10 Stack Limit, When used on a target, a green number is shown on targets head which shows Goo stacks. Each time Goo is casted number goes up. Buff max out at 10, but the green number on targets head does not exceed 9.

* **Centaur Warrunner  Return buff**

# ~~~~Neutrals' gold/xp bounty increases by 3% per cycle, instead of 2%~~~~

~~~~The changelog stated a 2% increase per 7.5 minutes. But currently, they increase by 3%.~~~~

~~~~Easiest way to test this is with Roshan (yes, he is affected by this)~~~~

* ~~~~Killing Roshan on minute 7 grants 890 xp (750 +20*7)~~~~
* ~~~~If it would increase by 2%, killing him after 7:30, but before 8:00 should grant 907 xp (890*1.02)~~~~

~~~~Obviously shouldn't be the case. As of now, you cannot use Life Drain on Roshan (which is basically Pugna's only way to contribute to fighting Roshan), because it will reveal Roshan to the enemy team.~~~~

~~~~Now, due to another old bug which prevents Pugnas and Lions from using Life/Mana Drain when they were created with -createhero, I cannot demonstrate this with enemy Pugna perspective.~~~~

# Eye of the Storm doesn't prioritise lower hp target if multiple enemies are Static Linked

Minor thing which matters for Refresher Razors, which isn't too uncommon, since all his spells synergise well with it.

Since 7.06, his storm strikes the linked target if it is within strike range. So what happens if you have multiple enemies Static Linked?

**Current behavior:** When multiple enemies are Static Linked, the storm strikes them randomly

**Expected behavior:** When multiple enemies are Static Linked, the storm prioritises the one with the lowest hp

#Hunter in the Night doesn't grant flying vision when cast by other heroes than Night Stalker

The vision is currently only working for Night Stalker. When the spell gets cast by any other hero, they do not gain flying vision.

#Rubick's Pulse Nova/Culling Blade do not apply Lightning Storm/Battle Hunger when upgraded

This is a big let-down.

When there is forced synergy like this going on, Rubick usually copies this. This is how it works(/worked) for other scepter upgrades which make use of multiple spells. For example, his Sanity's Eclipse and Global Silence did apply Astral Imprisonment and Arcane Curse. His Freezing Field does apply Frostbite. Even from this patch, his Mystic Snake does apply the Stone Gaze debuff on enemies.

But the new Pulse Nova doesn't randomly strike enemies with lightnings, and Culling Blade doesn't apply Battle Hunger on enemies.

#Supernova, Rearm, -wtf and -refresh do not replenish charges

Currently, only Refresher Orb is able to replenish charges of spells. And the dev command version of -refresh (the chat-entered -refresh does not)

However, all of these are able to refresh the cooldown on the charge-based abiliyt, and if you attempt to cast it, it gives you "CUSTOM ERROR" as error message.

So there are 2 issues:

1. Them being able to refresh that cooldown is completely pointless if no charges are replenished
2. The fact that the custom error message has been removed (it used to say "No charges", but not says "CUSTOM ERROR") indicates that Refresher change was supposed to be a general change, and not specific to Refresher only.

So the most logical thing here would be to make Supernova, Rearm and the -refresh and -wtf commands replenish charges as well

# Soul Catcher (and Shadow Poison) don't affect *all* units under Disruption

Not a new bug, but it is more relevant now, with the Soul Catcher change.

Shadow Demon has this synergy going on between Disruption and his spells, that being all of his spells are able to affected units under Disruption.

However, they can only affect the *last* unit SD Disrupted, so if you have multiple enemies disrupted, only the last one will get hit.

**Current behavior:** Shadow Poison and Soul Catcher only debuff (or add stacks) on the last disrupted enemy

**Expected behavior:** Shadow Poison and Soul Catcher debuff (or add a stack) to *all* disrupted enemies. It also should not matter whether the disruption was cast by an enemy or by an ally (e.g. enemy Rubick).

**Note:** The damage of Demonic Purge and release damage of Shadow Poison work fine. They always hit disrupted units.

# Spell charges granted by Aghs or Talents do not have infinite charges in wtf mode

This isn't a new bug, but I mention this because we now have another hero who suffers from this issue.

**Current behavior:** -wtf mode grants infinite charges to: 

* Spin Web
* Spirit Siphon
* Stone Remnant
* Fire Remnant
* Shrapnel

**But it does *not* grant infinite charges to:**

* Cold Feet (talent-granted charges)
* Rupture (scepter-granted charges)
* Homing Missile (talent-granted charges)
* Astral Imprisonment (scepter-granted charges)
* Demonic Purge (scepter-granted charges)

**Expected behavior:** -wtf mode should grant infinite charges to all charge-based spells, and not to only those which are charge-based by default.

#Enchanted Mangoes can't be sold within 10 seconds after purchase

Mangoes do not have the 10 seconds refund time anymore. I know they were turned unsellable, but they should at least have the 10 refund phase where you can sell items back for their full price.

As of now, an accidentally bought mango cannot be refunded. Especially in the early game this could be annoying. When you re-decide on your starting items (which seems to be kind of a common thing in any bracket, based on what I observed and experienced), you can't undo the mango.

**Edit:** Looks like you can sell them, but only pre-horn. Afer the first creep wave spawns, it can't be sold at all anymore. Which is still kind of nonsense. It should always have the 10 seconds refund time.

# Shockwave always uses the default sound upon traveling back when upgraded.

Ever failed your typical avatoss combo as Tiny? Ever felt like sometimes your hero just ignores your spellcast orders? This bug here may the reason why.|self.DotA2|~##**Required basics to understand the issue**

First, let me show you how your unit reacts to receiving multiple orders very quickly:

[Video 1, demo of the auto-queue] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLmzSog83H8)

In this video, you can see how Tiny executes multiple given orders. **I did not use shift-queue**. If I would have done that, the [key screencast would have shown capsed latters and you would have seen the small shift-queue flags on the ground] (http://i.imgur.com/djIrC1h.png). You can see how the game auto-queues a maximum of 2 orders. If you give a 3rd order, the first order is forgotten and the unit executes the last 2 (considering it didn't start executing the 1st order). That's why I couldn't do blink->veil->avalanche. In that order, Tiny only did veil->avalanche.

----
##**The issue**

Ok, and now to the bug which involves auto-attacking (in other words, attacks which the unit does on itself without giving it the direct order to do so). This is what happens when you order your hero to quickly cast multiple spells while auto-attacking:

[Video 2, the bug which breaks the auto-queue] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szmWxG9b174)

As you can see, when auto-attacking, Tiny only executed the last ordered spell, ignoring the first one. So avatoss is basically impossible if you click too fast. If you have auto-attack on, you must wait for one spell to get cast first before ordering the 2nd one. I.e., Tiny must first start casting avalanche before you give the toss order, otherwise the toss order will cancel out the avalanche order.

You can also see in the video that attack-ground has the same issue, demonstrated with Puck. Because if you give an attack order on the ground, your unit follows regular auto-attack rules. The auto-attack messes with jaunt->waning rift. If you press jaunt hotkey followed by rift hotkey, jaunt will not get cast (note that jaunt, like tiny's spells, has a 0 second cast time).

And here is a comparison to forced attacks (i.e. directly targeting a unit with an attack (a+target unit, or right-click unit)):

[Video 3, comparison to direct attack orders, which don't break the auto-queue] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFIa2ATkjok)

When giving a direct attack order on a unit, ordered spells still get auto-queued normally (up to 2 spells again, like before)

----
##**Another auto-attack issue**

And here is another issue caused by auto-attacks, which I feel like is related to the issue above:

[Video 4, another bug regarding auto-attacks and targeted attacks] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om75CpxJI98)

If your unit is auto-attacking another unit, and then, during its attack animation, you give the unit a direct attack order *on the same target*, your unit will *cancel* its current and completely restart its attack on the same target. This makes no sense at all, attack orders on the current attack target should not cancel an ongoing attack on the target.

----
##**Conclusion:**

Auto-attack orders are treated differently than direct attack orders. That difference messes with the "auto-queue" effect and potentially messes with spell combos, even with the most simple ones (avatoss, jaunt->waning rift, midnight pulse->blackhole, tornado->emp, slight of fist->searing chains, etc etc).

###**It would be nice if Valve would change this and make auto-attacks behave like directly targeted attacks.**


*Edit: If you want to repro this, it is very simply. Just pick tiny and go to an enemy. Order an attack on the ground so that Tiny starts attacking it. While attacking, cast avalanche and toss on the unit. Easiest way to do this is to use quickcast and simply press ava and toss hotkeys simultaniously. You should notice that most of the time, Tiny will only cast one of the 2 spells.*

Arc Warden is currently receiving half exp when his tempest double is out|self.DotA2|~**I want to emphasize that Zet's clone effectively removes exp from the game, if it participates in fights it means that your entire team suffers as a result, if it helps push, your team suffers as a result. Any exp it receives disappears from the game after it vanishes.**

**It should either work like a Meepo clone, or receive no exp whatsoever. The latter option is probably safer from a balance perspective.** 

Exp comparisons: http://imgur.com/a/eO5iY



-| Just Zet| Zet /w Double
---|---|----
One creep wave | 227 exp | 113 exp
One level 11 axe kill at lvl 6| 1000 exp| 610 exp


So if you've played Arc Warden in the last week you may have noticed that you were inexplicably falling behind in levels compared to your teammates and enemies. I chalked this up to me being bad with the hero and needing to "get good" or a consequence of playing safely with the double, but actually there's a pretty huge bug that's causing Arc warden to get half the exp he would normally get when his clone is out. His clone receives half of the exp and is treated like a teammate, so whenever he uses  his ult, he receives half the normal amount of exp from creeps, or kills. 

This might be what set his winrate back to the stoneage because he already has shitty stat gains, he's usually playing at a lower level than everyone else. 

TLDR: Tempest Double behaves like a hero and recieves half the exp that Zet does, leading to underleveled Zet

I don't see how this could be intended but if it is feel free to berate me. 

Edit: Mandatory dev.dota2 thread http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=187175&p=1292803#post1292803

AND IT'S FIXED. Thank you mr lizard.

#1. Cold Feet (& Homing Missile) always use level 1 cooldown as recharge time, regardless of level

Cold Feet has a cooldown of 13/11/9/7. So when chosing the charges talent on level 25, you'd expect the recharge time to be equal to the cooldowns right? Yea, but that's not quite the case.

**Repro:**

1. Level up to 25 and chose the Cold Feet charges talent
2. Have Cold Feet on level 2 or higher (most noticable with level 4)
3. Immediately use all your charges
4. Check the recharge time (displayed like a cooldown when having 0 charges)
5. As soon as a charge is ready, use it up immediately again
6. Check the recharge time again

**Result:** The *very first* charge recharging uses the current level's cooldown as recharge time. *All other* charges recharging right after it use the level 1 cooldown as recharge time. So for it to use the correct time, you must have 3/3 charges, otherwise it will use the lvl 1 recharge time.

**Expected behavior:** All charges should recharge using the current level's cooldown.

#2. Cold Feet's break distance is spherical, instead of a flat circle

Usually, Dota 2 uses 2 dimensional areas for this kind of stuff. Cold Feet is one of the 2 spells which use a 3 dimensional shape for their range checks. (edit: The second spell being Timbersaw's Chakrams).

**Repro:**

1. Cast Cold Feet on an enemy
2. Have a Tiny toss the same unit straight upwards

**Result:** Cold Feet gets dispelled, because Toss moves the unit outside of the spherical shaped search area

**Expected behavior:** Like every other aoe effect, Cold Feet's search area should be a 2 dimensional circle.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X9-3Lq8Z6Q)

Edit: Note that Toss is just the best example. Any way of upward movement can cancel it when being far enough away from the center. a Cyclone cancels it when about 300 range off from the center.

#3. Rubick copies the charges-talent when stealing Cold Feet (& Homing Missile)

Rubick genereally does *not* copy and talent bonus spells receive. For some reason, Cold Feet and Homing Missile talents are the only ones being copied.

**Repro:**

1. Steal Cold Feet (or Homing Missile) from an enemy AA (or Gyro) who has the lvl 25 charges talent skilled
2. Steal any other talent-boosted spell from another enemy

**Result:** Your stolen Cold Feet has the charges as well, the talent gets copied. Other stolen talent-boosted spells are not talent-boosted for Rubick.

**Expected behavior:** The talent bonus should not be copied.

**Personal opinion:** Would be much better if Rubick would copy talent bonuses the enemy has chosen. Or at least as an aghs upgrade.

#4. Ice Blast can shatter enemies who are above the shatter threshold

This is an issue caused by how Ice Blast checks for health and shatters. Currently, it checks for your health on each tick. If on one tick your hp is below the shatter threshold, you *will* shatter on the next tick. This means, if you Time Lapse or Sunder within that tick, you'll still shatter.

**Repro:**

1. Get hit by Ice Blast
2. Have your hp drop close to the shatter point
3. As soon as reaching the shatter point, cast Time Lapse/Sunder so that your above the threshold again

**Result:** You shatter, even if you managed to heal back up to full health.

**Expected behavior:** The health check and the shatter should happen on the same tick, and not be delayed by a tick

**Personal opinion:** Make Ice Blast prevent *absolutely every* form of hp increase. As of now, 4 sources are still able to "heal" through it, 2 of them being obvious bugs (see below), and the other 2 being Sunder and Time Lapse.

#5. Decay and Whirling Death can heal through Ice Blast's hp freeze

Ice Blast is supposed to freeze your hp. Every healing and hp regen is prevented. *Even hp gain from gaining strength is prevented, like picking up str items, toggling Armlet or morphing strength*. But for some reason, Decay and Whirling Death (the hp again upon losing the debuff when being a str hero) are not prevented.

**Repro as Undying:**

1. Be at like 50% hp
2. Get hit by Ice Blast
3. Cast Decay on enemy heroes (with Aghs, for more obvious results)

**Result:** The 50% hp part isnt necessary, but makes this much clearer. Your current hp raises. The healing aspect of Decay (which is coded into the ability) goes through Ice Blast and heals you.

**Repro as Timbersaw**

1. Be a strength hero and at like 50% hp (again, hp amount only to make it more obvious)
2. Get hit by Whirling Death
3. Before the debuff expires, get hit by Ice Blast. Time it so that it expires while frostbitten

**Result:** Upon losing the Whirling Death debuff, you get healed (same as with Decay, this is coded into the ability). That healing ignores the Ice Blast debuff and heals through it.

**Expected behavior:** Just like how it is with other str granting effects, Decay and Whirling Death should not be able to increase your current hp while frostbitten.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrLJRsdV9YE)

(PS: In the video, you can also see how Whirling Death's heal per strength was not updated from 19 to 20. Omni lost 18.69 strength per WD debuff, and upon expiring, he regained 355 hp per debuff, 18.69\*19=355.11)

---

#6.Ice Blast prevents Reaper's Scythe from increasing respawn time

It also prevents Necrophos from getting the kill credits.

**Repro:**

1. Hit an enemy hero with Ice Blast
2. Before they shatter, cast Reaper's Scythe on it, so that they shatter during its stun

**Result:** The shatter kills the target, creditting it to whoever caused the shatter. Its respawn time is not increased.

**Expected behavior:** Reaper's Scythe should probably take priority. It should force the credit to Necrophos. Either way, it definitely should apply its respawn time increase, no matter how the target dies during it.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hak6X5fG_gk)

---

#7. Ice Blast prevents Duel from graning victory damage

Only happens when the *caster* of Duel dies to the shatter. Works fine when the duel *target* dies to Ice Blast instead.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Duel on an enemy
2. Get hit by Ice Blast
3. Die to Ice Blast's shatter during the duel 
4. Repeat the test, but this time with the duel target dying to Ice Blast shatter

**Result:** Your duel target, who is victor, does not gain the victory damage bonus. If the roles are reversed (duel target dies to ice blast shatter, instead of duel caster), the victor does gain the victory damage

Note that the behavior is not bugged when not dying to the shatter (i.e. enemy straight-out kills you without the shatter proccing)

**Expected behavior:** The target should be able to gain the damage if the duel caster dies to Ice Blast.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce_qTM3mURo)

---

#8. Ice Blast prevents Wraith King's Reincarnation when having Soul Ring buff

Happens when you need the Soul Ring's 150 mana for the Reincarnation.

**Repro:**

1. Be Wraith King at low mana
2. Use your Soul Ring so that you have enough mana with Reincarnation
3. Die to Ice Blast's shatter

**Result:** Despite having enough mana, you do not reincarnate. You do reincarnate if the shatter was not the cause of the death (i.e. enemy just kill you straigh-out without the shatter proccing)

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5fFaGwm7l4)

---

#9. Tempest Double's gold/xp bounties are not granted when it dies to Ice Blast shatter

**Repro:**

1. Hit an enemy Tempest Double with Ice Blast
2. Drop its health below the shatter threshold

**Result:** When it dies to the shatter, its gold/xp bounties are not granted. Its bounties are granted when the shatter was not the cause of the death (i.e. you kill it straight-out, without the shatter proccing).

**Expected behavior:** Gold and experience should be granted normally.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdlFjGcsr_4)

#10. Ice Blast (and False Promise) instantly remove hp gained through Granite Aura.

When you are at full hp and are affected by the ancient golem's Granite Aura, getting hit by Ice Blast instantly reduces your hp back to its regular value. Same goes for when getting targeted by False Promise.

**Repro:**

1. Be at full or almost full hp and stand within Granite Aura range
2. Get hit by Ice Blast or targeted by False Promise

**Result:** Your current hp instantly drops to what it would be if you were not affected by Granite Aura.

**Expected behavior:** Your current hp should freeze at where it is at, and not where it would be without the aura. The aura bonus should not be removed by Ice Blast/False Promise

**Example:** Let's say your hero has 1000 health by default. When the Granite Aura affects you, your health raises to 1150. When hit by Ice Blast/False Promise, your hp instantly drops from 1150/1150 to 1000/1150.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89ILa0g9tbI)

---

#11. Recasting Ice Blast makes the previous cast hit the new location

Your typical multi-instance bug. If you cast Ice Blast before the previous cast's projectile impacts, it messes with the previous projectile.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Ice Blast and Release the icy ball
2. Before the Icy ball impacts, re-cast Ice Blast at a new location

**Result:** The ice ball of the *first* cast explodes where you *targeted* the *second* Ice Blast (not where you stopped the 2nd cast's tracer, it literally explodes where you clicked with your mouse). It explodes there upon reaching its own marked area.

**Expected behavior:** A new cast should not interfere with previous casts. The previous Ice Blast should exlode where its aoe indicator is.

Yes, this is abusable, but not worth the Refresher Orb.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNCSzVi2rnw)

---

#12. AA illusions have lvl 1 Ice Blast when spawned while the sub-spell is active
# ALT-clicking Ice Blast always says it's level 1 when done while the sub-spell is active

This happens because the sub-spell has only 1 level, instead of having 3 levels like the main spell.

**Repro:**

1. Have Ice Blast on level 2 or 3
2. Cast Ice Blast, but don't release the ice ball
3. While the tracer travels, spawn illusions of Ancient Apparition
4. Also ALT-click Ice Blast meanwhile

**Result:** The illus have level 1 Ice Blast, instead of 2/3. ALT-clicking it also says it's on level 1, instead of 2/3

**Expected behavior:** Illus should copy the correct level. ALT-clicking should also show the correct level. The sub-spell should have 3 levels like the main spell and its level should be set equal to Ice Blast's level.

Other spells with the same bug:

* Tether
* Nightmare
* Telekinesis
* Song of the Siren

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPzeN12RyJY)

---

#13. Ice Blast malfunctions when cast by an illusion and the illu dies during it

A very rare bug, but still a bug nontheless. When an illusion casts Ice Blast, and it dies during it (doesn't matter if while the tracer or the ice ball travels), the ice ball does nothing and the aoe indicator gets stuck

**Repro:**

1. Pick Rubick and get Aghanim's Scepter
2. Spell-steal Nether Swap
3. Die, so that the Vengeance illusion spawns
4. Spell-steal Ice Blast with the Vengeance Rubick illusion
5. Cast Ice Blast
6. While either of its projectiles travel, have the illusion die (no matter how)

**Result:** When dying while the tracer travels, the tracer stops and marks the area, and the ice ball gets released (expected behavior, since this is what happens when AA or Rubick die during it). However, the ice ball neither debuffs enemies it passes through, nor applies the impact damage/debuff upon reaching its destination. Furthermore, the giant dome marking the aoe gets permanently stuck.

**Expected behavior:** Same behavior as when AA or Rubick die during it: Ice ball can debuff enemies, impact damage/debuffing applies, giant aoe marking dome disappears once the ball explodes.

### Pet peeves

* The Radiant buildings' portraits now look way too good compared to the Dire ones. Maybe show Dire buildings some love as well?
* Doom's aghs tooltip is redundant, as Aghs damage is just the same values as the normal damage now. - /u/Ryaqsm
* The Axe shoulder piece(noticably when equipping larger cosmetics) and other immortals clip through the head of Axe. - /u/wakek3k3
* Axe's culling blade tooltip is outdated - /u/reapr56
* When you encounter someone in fog certain abilities play sounds/animations like theyre just now happening. Like chemical rage playing the transformation sound when used/expiring or invoker summons always appearing to be just now summoned when encountering from fog. - /u/FrankWalls
* Emoticons don't stop animation in regional chat - /u/HeisenbergLetsCook
* The 'Reborn sound' that indicates that something happened plays at random sometimes - /u/thyL_ - [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3vahx0/the_reborn_sound_of_open_parties_etc_should_not/)

* When you load into a game the grey bar in the right side is blocking a big portion of the loading screen shown in the background. Some transparency would be nice. - /u/LouizSander , /u/anyymi
* If you type in chat at the beginning after someone disconnects (in draft screen), sometimes the text turns red or the color of the person that disconnected. - /u/coriamon
* Any recipe you carry before the game ends is shown as the item itself on the Main Menu and on Latest Matches. - /u/Colpus
* Choosing a side (Radiant. Dire, Random) in co-op bot matches does not persist - /u/woundeddolphin , others
* Neutral trolls (the ones that spawn with the healer) use a placeholder projectile (same as the ranged lane creep's projectile) instead of the actual axes they throw. - /u/vimescarrot
* Some audio files simply have effects filters missing ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KUCbQfHq20&feature=youtu.be)) - /u/DarkQuill
* No longer being able to view profiles before the game starts - /u/Adequate_Meatshield , others

If you have noticed any other small inconsistencies like these, comment and they'll get  added here.

I really hope this can make it to front page, so that maybe it'll get noticed by the developers and hopefully even a few of the listed issues get fixed.


**~~~~DISCLAIMER~~~~**

~~~~The thread exploded, I am currently at work and cannot process all these posts atm. Will go through them once I get back home~~~~


**~~~~UPDATE~~~~**

~~~~Arrived home and went through the 100+ new comments I had to that moment. Added quite a few to the OP. Will do another batch later.~~~~

~~~~Added batch No.2 . Will add another batch either later, if I don't fall asleep, or tomorrow (probably after I get back from work, sorry).~~~~

**UPDATE 4**

Added batch No.3. Will probably go to sleep now, will try to add stuff tomorrow before I leave for work, and the rest after work.

Also sorry if I have misattributed some bugs, or if I did not list all the people who reported them, but the comments list length is getting pretty crazy. 

Also, to whom it may concern: Thanks for the gold.~|bug

[Bug] Unintentional PA nerf|self.DotA2|~Recently the PA dagger has been reworked to perform a physical attack on landing. Phantom strike gives you IAS for 4 attacks 'on the same target'.

So if you dagger on one target, and phantom strike on another, then the dagger hit cancels your IAS for the phantom strike because it now thinks you switched targets.

~~~~In a certain situation this might even be gamebreaking.~~~~

Edit : wew my first front page post   ^_^ thanks r/dota2

Edit 2 : as pointed out by someone it is not gamebreaking but it may cause you to lose a game in a very specific situation.

Kunkka's X has shorter duration when targeted on self (status resistance).|self.DotA2|~Title. 

I don't think that should be the case. It's really annoying later in the game, as you'll lose about 20% of it's duration assuming you go for the 25 str talent. 

The debuff shown above your hp does ***not*** show the reduced (actual) status time too, which really messes up your timing if you wanted to blink tidebringer near the end of X.~|bug

Here is part 2, covering other stuff, like minor glitches, inconsistencies, inconveniences and some suggestions.

Note that most of these are not considered bugs. They are things that I think are hindering the hero unecessarily and would be nice if they were changed/tweaked.

#1. Heroes who cant sell aghs, still cant sell it after getting Aghs Synth buff

There are several heroes who cannot sell their Scepters (earth spirit, lifestealer, treant, meepo, etc), due to the nature of the upgrade they get.

However, once getting the Aghs Synth buff from Alchemist, it would make sense to allow them to sell it, since they still have the Synth buff after selling it.

They already can sell a second bought aghs, or even their first aghs if bought after getting the synth buff. Only the first aghs from before getting the snyth buff cannot be sold.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_npJs14caf8)

---

#2. Alchemist's illusions gain mana regen from Chemical Rage

This is an inconsistancy. No other source of mana regeneration works for illusions. Only Chemical Rage's regen works.

Health regeneration is consistant throughout, not even Chemical Rage's hp regen bonus works for them.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzsS7mgGZQM)

My suggestion: Make all mana regen sources work for them. I don't see a reason why not, really. It would be a small buff to Morphling aghs and Vengance aghs, the only illus who can cast spells.

---

#3. Make Unstable Concoction brew sound fade in/out when alche enters/leaves fog

Similar to how Stone Gaze, Illusory Orb and Ghostship work, Unstable Concoction's brew sound should fade in/out when Alchemist enters or leaves the fog of war.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Wt7-1uOJ0)

---

#4. Alchemist's ogre is not animated in Unstable Concoction Throw's animation

He just freezes whenever the sub-spell is cast. Only Razzil sitting on the Ogre is animated. He also lacks a throw animation during Chemical Rage. Whenever the Throw is cast, the ogre's swords slide back on his back.

[Vide demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13XQ8bPzxu8)

---

#5. Midas Knuckle's custom Greevil's Greed effect does not work.

Nothing more to add, really.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOwHBK7BWMU)

---

#6. Unstable Concoction brew sound cancels upon projectile impact of a previous cast

Another case of spells interfering with each other. If you start brewing unstable concoction while the previous cast's projectile still flies, the new cast's brew sound stops as soonas the projectile hits.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S47WsMZK-4)

---

#7. Chemical Rage causes attack animations to not random

Normally, a hero has multiple different animations for attacks, and they are randomly chosen per attack. But during Chemical Rage, the hero just repeats one animation until canceling and restarting an attack. This affects Rubick as well, when he steals Chemical Rage.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_JxskqOtHk)

---

#8. The +80 Unstable Concoction damage talent is not added to the tooltip damage value

This goes for every new ability-buffing talent in 7.02.

Very easy fix.  This thing

    "LinkedSpecialBonus"            "special_bonus_unique_..."

needs to be added to the affected values, in this case the concoction damage.

#10 Tooltip stuff

This time it's only adding and changing of notes mainly.

* Add note to Unstable Concoction that it still applies the aoe effect when blowing up on self
* Reword existing concoction notes to not have "will" and "you" in them (to fit the general style)
* Add note to Greevil's Greed saying that it doesn't work vs illus and buildings
* Add note to Greevil's Greed explaining its stacking behavior
* Add note to Greevil's Greed telling that it's unreliable gold
* Reword Greevil's Greed buff to not include "you".
* Fix Chemical Rage note to not say "avoid stuns", since that's incorrect
* Separate the disjoint part from that note and say that it applies upon cast (current one makes it sound like it disjoints everything for 0.35 seconds)
* Add note to Chemical Rage telling that illus copy the buff

##Bugs

#1. Berserker's Call's (and Winter's Curse) taunts malfunction when affected by multiple taunts at the same time

This is a bug which can screw you over when you have Axe+WW, Axe+Legion or WW+Legion (or even all 3) in one team.

If you are affected by two taunts, your unit will attack the first taunt source, and switch over to the second taunt source once the first one expires. However, if you spam your unit an order during the first taunt, it bugs out. Instead of switching to the second taunt source, your unit instead executes the order given to it. After finishing that order, it stands still, doing nothing until the second taunt expires.

**Current behavior:** Orders given at the transition between two taunts overrides the attack order of the taunt.

**Expected:** Taunts should periodically order your unit to attack the taunting unit. If the unit is found to execute a different order, the taunt should cancel it and force you to attack again.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofFVTjb8dt8)

**Also:** It would be nice if taunts would get a priority order. As of now, Duel has priority over other taunts. But Axe's Call and WW's curse have the same priority. So instead of 

* **Duel > Winter's Curse = Berserker's Call**

make it 

* **Duel > Winter's Curse > Berserker's Call**

---

#2. Berserker's Call malfunctions when Axe turns invisible during it

When Axe turns invisible during any time of Berserker's Call, and the enemy has no True Sight over him, the taunted enemies can moved around and order to cast spells. However, like in the previous bug, only *one* order gets executed. After that order, the unit stands still until the taunt expires.

**Current behavior:** Taunted units can execute one order when axe turns invis during Berserker's Call

**Expected behavior:** Multiple possibilities:

* Make it work like how it does when Axe enters the fog of war: The taunted units follow him and attack him again once turning visible
* Taunted units stand still for the remaining duration, or until Axe is visible again, resuming attack
* The taunt ends immediately once Axe turns fully invisible and when not revealed.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXDmpYT1-pw)

---

#3. Counter Helix does not use a regular cooldown, so it can't be reduced/increased

Counter Helix's cooldown seems to be hardcoded into the ability as some sort of custom cooldown system. This causes two issues:

1. The cooldown cannot be changed. It can neither be increased (Time Dilation) or reduced (Ocarine Core, Arcane Rune, Chakra Magic)
2. The icon of the ability does not show the cooldown upon proccing

As a comparison, Legion Commander's Moment of Courage, another passive ability with a very short cooldown, uses a regular cooldown. You can see it going on cooldown on the icon when proccing, and more importantly, it is reduced by Octarine Core/Arcane Rune (and affected by Time Dilation and Chakra Magic)

**Current:** Counter Helix uses some weird custom cooldown system.

**Expected:** Counter Helix should use the regular default cooldown system.

In the video, you can see how I set the "cooldown" to 10 seconds. But the ability uses this cooldown only to display the cooldown value in the description. As of now, this value has no other purpose.

[Video demo] (http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=193346)

---

#4. Culling Blade's kill threshold is off by 1 on each level

The kill threshold is supposed to be 250/325/400 (300/425/550 with Scepter).

Instead, it is 249/324/399 (299/424/549 with scepter), off by 1 on each level, with and without scepter.

Looks like "<" was used in the codes here. It should be "".

[Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igRQP_hW4O0)

---

#5. Culling Blade can be cast on Wraith ghosts (WK's aghs effect) without killing them

Culling Blade cannot kill a hero who is in Wraith form (Wraith King's Aghanim's Scepter effect, green ghosts). But it can be cast on them. When done, it applies the effects as if the target was killed (aoe boost & cooldown reset).

**Current behavior:** Culling Blade can target, but not kill wraiths, applying aoe speed resetting cooldown

**Expected behavior:** two options:

* Culling Blade cannot target wraiths
* Culling Blade kills wraiths when targeted (would be consistent other death-preventing effects like grave, false promise and borrowed time)

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_ogyCPlgY8)

---

#6. Rubick loses the move speed bonus from Battle Hunger upon losing the spell

Battle Hunger is supposed to grant you movement speed for each enemy you have cursed. But Rubick loses the speed upon losing the spell, despite there still being cursed enemies.

**Current behavior:** Battle Hunger's speed bonus disappears on spell loss, ignoring the fact that there still are cursed enemies.

**Expected behavior:** The speed bonus lasts until no cursed enemies are left.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT6pIzKbZ54)

##Tooltip stuff

His tooltip have several small issues and are heavily lacking in the ALT notes.

**Berserker's Call:**

* Has an unnecessary note about spell immunity (info is already in the box header)
* Could make use of some new notes:
* ALT note: Taunted units follow Axe if they can't attack or when Axe can't be attacked.
* ALT note: Taunt is not canceled upon losing vision over Axe.
* Alt note: Cannot taunt wards and buildings.
* ALT note: Taunt immediately ends when Axe dies.
* ALT note: Axe gains the armor even if the taunt fully misses.

**Battle Hunger:**

* Description doesn't clarify that Axe gains ms for units *he* cursed (i.e. Rubick's curses don't buff Axe)
* First ALT note only mentions buildings (destroying buildings also removes curse). Should also mention wards and denying allies.
* Second ALT note is redundant and slightly misleading. It says cursed units cant be denied. But you still can deny cursed non-heroes. And heroes are generally not denyable (only 3 debuffs in the game allow denying).
* ALT note: Killing illus does not remove the curse
* ALT note: Multiple curses don't stack on a target (should be mentioned since it lasts longer than its cooldown)
* ALT note: Kills done with wards don't remove the curse for their owner (common misconception that it does, should be clarified)
* The self-buff doesn't tell how much ms you currently gain.
* The curse debuff does not say that it slows you, it only mentions the damage.

**Counter Helix:**

* Unecessary mention of damag type in the description (info is already in the box header)
* First ALT note is kind of expected to work like that. Reword it to tell interaction with missed attacks instead. Or remove completely.
* ALT note: Counter Helix works while hexed (common misconception that it doesn't, mainly due to lack of visual feedback)
* ALT note: Does not proc on attacks of wards and buildings (although I think it would be better to make it proc on building/ward attacks instead)

**Culling Blade:**

* Slightly wrong information in description. It currently says that the speed bonus and cooldown reset are only applied upon killing heroes. However, only the cooldown reset applies when killing heroes. The speed bonus also applies when culling non-hero units*
* ALT note: Does not go on cooldown upon killing heroes and illusions (to have illus mentioned as well)
* ALT note: Aoe speed is always applied, not only when culling heroes (extra clarification)
* ALT note: Can kill heroes who are affected by spells which usually prevent death (Shallow Grave, False Promise and Borrowed Time are meant)
* The speed buff does not say how much speed it grants

BUG: Viper, Huskar, Silencer and Clinkz have lower range when orb attacking than normally.|self.DotA2|~**I reported this more than 5 months ago, posted it in the dota 2 dev forum and Valve didn't do anything about it. Maybe it will make it to the first page this time so that Valve devs see it and do something about it.**

All these heroes have bugs related to their relative talent trees. The bugs occur when they pick dragon lance and skill their range increasing talents. Right clicking gives them the correct attack range, but if you want to orb attack (orb auto cast is off), then the attack range is lower.

You can consistently escape Pounce and Kinetic Field prematurely by abusing terrain + a spell/spamming right-clicks|self.DotA2|~tl;dr here's the video https://youtu.be/jlsOAaahNx0

You might have seen my comment in another thread where I was testing for this bug, but I'm making it a separate post because with the help of /u/mrShoes1, I've figured out how to make it work 100% of the time. It's gone beyond the point of testing and is now just a confirmed bug. Here's a new YouTube video where I try to explain it as well as I can: 

https://youtu.be/jlsOAaahNx0

Really late edit because I forgot: bu3ny on dev.dota figured out that anything blocking the straight path will cause this bug, including units: https://youtu.be/hjoQwNsEOiM

**Non-Youtube explanation:**
Corners and walls are bugged in their interaction with Slark's Pounce and Disruptor's Kinetic Field. By standing near a wall (~~100 units?) while affected by one of these two abilities, you can prematurely break their effects in two ways:

1. Cast a single-target spell on anyone beyond its max range, instantly breaking you free to cast your spell (replicable 100% of the time with any single-target spell at any range beyond maximum).
2. Spam right clicks on somebody outside of your max range while reasonably close to a wall. Also 100% consistent, though with a bit of delay.

This is actually brutal for the play of both heroes, because it's actually so consistent and incredibly easy to perform. The degree of difficulty is akin to being a Spirit Breaker and finding a unit to charge away to! While I welcome the neutering of the annoying fish, it's actually easier to ruin the dinosaur king's life, and my friend actually really likes playing him so I hope it gets fixed before he feeds with Disruptor ^again ^^as ^^^usual

Using liquid fire from jakiro does not affect small structure and tier 4 towers on radiant, but it does on the dire.|self.DotA2|This is a big issue, being able to push down 3 structures at the same time instead of just 1 is not a fair push.|bug
An old game-breaking disruptor bug is actually quite impactful now due to his new talents and some newer items.|self.DotA2|~So basically as far back as I can remember Disruptor's Kinetic Field (E) has had a major known bug where casting a second one while a first was active would cause the first wall to do nothing, meaning enemies who you trapped inside can walk through the first wall freely even though it should still be active. You can reproduce this extremely easily in demo mode by enabling free spells, trapping an enemy in a wall, then casting another wall somewhere else which allows them to walk through the first wall.

Previously this wasn't a huge deal because it only mattered if you had a refresher orb which was almost never bought on disruptor. Now however, with the -3s kinetic field cooldown lvl 15 talent and the +4s duration lvl 25 talent, this bug actually matters in games that go late if you choose those talents as the duration is longer than the cooldown with those talents, and it can be a huge deal for people who don't know about it. It also comes into play earlier due to arcane rune and also if you have a kotl on your team who reduces your cooldown via his E, or if you buy an octarine/refresher, or if you pick up the refresher shard from the third rosh kill.

Essentially, though this bug has existed for a long time, the circumstances where it might be relevant have increased dramatically, from a single edge case where you had bought a refresher, to now where in addition to the refresher it also shows up when you either hit level 25, kill rosh 3 times, pick up an arcane rune after level 15, have a kotl on your team, or buy octarine. Many of these circumstances are not exceptionally rare.

I'd like to get some attention for this bug to be fixed so that my "Make Dota Great Again" wall-building meme strat can be functional in turbo mode, and also so that people don't unwittingly screw themselves by making certain talent or item choices without knowing the full implications.~|bug automod

Kunkka's Tidebringer and Abyssal Blade Active using 128 cast range instead of 150|self.DotA2|~I went ahead and tested everything that uses melee range as an ability or item that I could think of and found that only Kunkka's Tidebringer and Abyssal Blade's Overwhelm are still using 128 cast range.

Spells/Heroes that I tested

- Dragon Knight Dragon Tail (Non ult version 150)
- Centaur Double Edge (150)
- Doom Infernal Blade (Autocast and manual are 150)
- Kunkka Tidebringer (Autocast is 150, manual is 128)
- Tusk Walrus Punch (Autocast and manual are 150)
- Abyssal Blade Overwhelm (140 cast) [My fault on initial test, still lower than melee range]

I think that these 2 specific casts are just oversights from the 6.87 update. If there is anything else that needs to be tested or you feel is incorrect let me know thank you.~|bug

I just played a game vs Naga and skilled +3 mana drain. Only the main target gets vaporized instead of all the mana drain targeted illusions. I think it cost us the game due to that bug. FeelsBadMan|self.DotA2|~Volvo please. I thought I picked the best support (Lion) that can handle illusion strats, specially late game. but no :(


1 mana drain (+3 at level 25) should be enough to kill illusions once naga cast mirror image. rather the target selects naga, if it's an illusion, only that illusion die and the other illusions still lives and run at you and kill you.

List of Dark Willow bugs|self.DotA2|~These are all the bugs I found in the last 2 days on Dark Willow.

If you know about more, post them here.

##**Dark Willow**

----
----
##General
---
#1. Dark Willow still uses Puck's placeholder loadout particles upon spawning

Nothing more to add. She uses Puck's Illusory Orb burst particle effects in the loadout. She should use something of her own set of particles.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXxzWEru4YU)

---
---
##Bramble Maze
---
#1. Leveling up Bramble maze during an active instance updates the damage, but not root duration

Inconsistent behavior when leveling the spell while there are brambles on the field already

**Repro:**

1. Cast Bramble Maze
2. Level up Bramble Maze
3. Have enemy walk into a bramble

**Result:** The bramble deals damage based on the *current* level, but roots for a duration based on the level *upon cast*

**Expected:** Either both should use current level, or both should use level upon cast.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCin9Fr35D4)

---

#2. Heavy visual glitch with the immortal's Bramble Maze effect

If you cast Bramble Maze 7-8 times with the immortal equipped, it completely breaks and your entire screen basically turns red.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9dL9QML__A)

---
---
## Shadow Realm
---
#1. Shadow Realm's damage doesn't apply when dispelled/dying before projectile hit

When Dark Willow gets dispelled or dies *after* launching the projectile, but *before* it hits, it will not apply the magical damage.

This is because the hidden modifier responsible for the damage is fully dispellable. It should not be.

Imagine if dispels or dying would stop e.g. TA's Meld attack from applying its damage/armor reduction. It makes no sense and shouldn't happen.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Shadow Realm
2. Launch an attack out of Shadow Realm
3. Before the projectile hits, get dispelled, or die

**Result:** The projectile deals no damage on impact.

**Expected:** Dispels and death should not nullify the damage.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6bxFGf0l4U)

---

#2. Recasting and attacking with Shadow Realm a second time deals no damage

When you recast Shadow Realm and launch an attack, while an attack of a previous cast is still flying, the new cast's projectile will deal no damage to its target.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Shadow Realm and attack out of it
2. Before the projectile hits, do the same again

**Result:** The second projectile deals no damage to its target. The first one deals its damage (correctly based on how long it was charged).

**Expected:** Each projectile should deal damage, based on how long they were charged. Previous cast should not matter to them.

**Reason of result:** Currently, Shadow Realm uses one modifier for each launched attack. And that one modifier is removed when the first launched attack hits its target. This means the attacks after it have no modifier for reference and therefore deal no damage.

**Solution:** Make each attack out of Shadow Realm place its own shadow_realm_buff_attack_logic modifier on Dark Willow, instead of each attack refreshing the already existing one.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en3zSnoSSxQ)

---

#3. Shadow Realm deals no damage if the target moved too far before impact

Shadow Realm's damage is not applied if the attack target moved too far before projectile impact. This means some heroes can just outrun it (e.g. Bloodseeker, or a non-disjointing mobility spell) to avoid the huge burst damage.

In this example, I used Meepo (Poof doesn't disjoint)

**Repro:**

1. Have a Meepo clone somewhere on the map
2. Have an enemy Dark Willow launch a Shadow Realm attack at you
3. Before the projectile hits you, Poof to your Meepo clone
4. wait for the projectile to impact

**Result:** The projectile deals no bonus magical damage. Only the regular attack damage is applied.

**Expected:** Distance shouldn't matter, it should always deal its damage on impact.

Reason for the result: The modifier responsible for the damage (placed on Dark Willow on attack launch) has a max duration of (I assume) 3 seconds. So it can expire before the attack lands, so that the bonus damage is not applied.

**Solution:** Remove the max duration.

If this is intended, then make the projectile turn into a regular attack projectile upon the modifier expiring, or make the projectile disappear altogether. Currently, it's nothing but confusing.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtiZ8DCj4Kc)

---

#4. Allies can't target Dark Willow during Shadow Realm, but can via portrait 

An allied Dark Willow's model cannot be selected while she is under the effect of Shadow Realm, so you cannot cast spells on her directly.

However, there are multiple was to still target here:

1. Shift-queue your spell before she casts Shadow Realm
2. Give the cast order while outside of cast range before she gives Shadow Realm
3. Start the cast before she enters Shadow Realm
4. Target her hero portrait at the top in the HUD

I think her model should be selectable for allies. Only enemies should be unable to select her.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oADHuq9UHdc)

---

#5. Shadow Realm's dmg buff doesn't disappear if it can't hit the target

The modifier responsible for the damage (dark_willow_shadow_realm_buff_attack_logic) does not disappear if the target:

1. Is Ethereal on impact
2. Is Invulnerable on impact
3. Is Hidden on impact
4. Disjoints the projectile
5. Evades the projectile with Evasion

The modifier should disappear when the projectile does. It should not soley rely on the projectile to actually connect with the target.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExnNDWdCMpc)

---

#6. Shadow Realm's projectile is invisible and silent when attacking runes with it

When you attack a Rune out of Shadow Walk, the attack projectile is invisible, and there is no projectile impact sound. From the enemy perspective, the rune may just disappear (if they don't know you are there and attacked it using the high attack range).

Also, the damage buff (shadow_realm_buff_attack_logic modifier) does not disappear either if the target was a rune.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N88sw81pjPg)

---

#7. Several projectile spells can still target Dark Willow during Shadow Realm

 Shadow Realm protects against most projectile spells, or "hit single random enemy" spells. This includes

1. Flaming Lasso (aghs secondary lasso), Viscous Nasal Goo (aghs upgraded), Searing Arrows (talent multishot), Battery Assault, Bedlam, Poison Touch, Exorcism, Marksmanship (aghs splinter arrows), Searing Chains, Sleight of Fist, Rocket Barrage, Flak Cannon, Pulse Nova (aghs single-target lightnings), Eclipse, Split Shot, Starstorm, Adaptive Strike (multishot talent), Ignite (multicast), Stifling Dagger (multishot talent), Unstable Current, Eye of the Storm, Ether Shock, Mass Serpent Wards (aghs split shot), Arcane Bolt (multishot talent & aghs multishot), Concussive Shot (aghs multishot), Ancient Seal (aghs multishot), Mystic Flare (aghs multishot), Assassinate (aghs aoe targeting), Charge of Darkness (target switching), Electric Vortex (aghs), Reflection, Soul Rip, Soul Assumption (multishot talent)


But these projectile spells can target her normally still

1. Spark Wraith
2. Mana Drain (multidrain talent)
3. Shadow Strike (650 aeo strike projectiles)
4. Concussive Shot
5. Heat-Seeking Missile
6. The Swarm
7. Shackleshot
8. Splinter Blast
9. Reincarnation Wraithfire Blasts

Considering that 80% of such spells can't target her, then these 9 shouldn't either.

---

#8. Shadow Realm doesn't cancel enemy single-target spells when already in their cast animations

Upon casting Shadow Realm, any attack an enemy had begun gets canceled, and she cannot be attacked during Shadow Realm

However, if an enemy already began casting a single target spell, that spell does not get canceled upon casting Shadow Realm. Spells cannot be targeted on her during Shadow Realm, but spells which are already in the cast animation ignore it completely.

**Repro:**

1. Get targeted by Nether Strike or Assassinate
2. During their long cast time, activate Shadow Realm

**Result:** Even though Shadow Realm was cast, the enemy Sniper/Spirit Breaker continue casting their single target spell. The cast does not get canceled.

**Expected:** Just like how attacks cancel, single-target spells should cancel when the target enters Shadow Realm.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E3i7pyhtE0)

---

#9. Shadow Realm doesn't protect against Wrath of Nature and Omnislash bounces

There are 17 bouncing spells in the game. Shadow Realm prevents 15 of them from jumping on Dark Willow. Wrath of Nature and Omnislash are the only ones which can still jump on her.

The other 15 which cannot are:  Shuriken Toss, Lightning Storm, Chain Frost, Moon Glaives, Mystic Snake, Spirit Lance, Fade Bolt, Laser, Fatal Bonds, Paralyzing Cask, Death Ward, Arc Lightning, Harpy Chain Lightning, Maelstrom/Mjollnir Chain Lightning

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ravcqhnakw)

---

#10. Shadow Realm doesn't stop Dark Willow's attack orders when cast out of attack range

Shadow Realm works similar to Shadow Walk: When cast while attacking, you automatically stop attacking, as to not waste the damage boosted attack out of Shadow Realm.

However, there is one issue. When you give Dark Willow and attack order so she first has to move closer to the target, and then cast Shadow Realm while she is moving closer, she will instantly attack and waste the spell completely.

As a comparison, when the same is done with Shadow Blade, the hero just moves within attack range and then stops there, not attacking the target.

Shadow Realm should do the same. Instead of immediately attacking, she should continue walking towards the target until within default attack range, and then you have to give an attack order again, to use the damage boosted attack properly.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gorY6W3A1-A)

---

#11. Shadow Realm prevets several AoE spells from hitting Dark Willow

Shadow Realm is supposed to protect against targeted spells (and I suppose, projectile based spells) and against attacks. But it currently also protects her against regular AoE spells. These spells are:

1. Aphotic Shield
2. Earthbind
3. Shield Crash
4. Stasis Trap
5. Overgrowth

They are all regular AoE spells, Shadow Realm should not protect against them.

---

#12. Shadow Realm's cast sound doesn't fade in/out upon gaining/losing vision over her

Usually, spells like this have their sounds fade in/out when you gain/lose vision over the source (e.g. Stone Gaze and Unstable Concoction).

Shadow Realm should do the same. Currently, it's either fully audible even after losing vision over her, or it is completely silent when she cast it in the fog and then came within vision range.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sGJtrePDOg)

Also, Terrorize's projectile could make use of this as well.

---

#13. Shadow Realm's sound doesn't stop when getting dispelled

When Shadow Realm gets dispelled (by an AoE dispel), the sound effect of it continues and doesn't stop.

The sound should stop on dispel.

##Cursed Crown
---
#1.  Cursed Crown pierces spell immunity when reflected back to the caster

It's a spell that does not pierce spell immunity by default. Therefore, it still should not pierce it when reflected.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eApeUBB4CC4)

---

#2. Cursed Crown's visual effect disappears when the target turns hidden

Cursed Crown turns completely invisible when the debuffed turn turns hidden.

The effects should stay visible at all times.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nmom_8pDeZI)

---
---
## Bedlam
---
#1. Bedlam is not visible in the HUD until Terrorize is learned, and can't be leveled up

This is inconistent with every other spell which comes with multiple abilities.

1. Shadowraze: All 3 razes are visible at all times and you can level the spell by pressing either.
2. Whirling Axes: Both are visible at all times and you can level by pressing either.
3. Adaptive Strike: Both visible at all times, can level by pressing either
4. Attribute Shift: You get the point

But then ther is Bedlam and Terrorize. You do not see Bedlam until Terrorize is leveld at least once. And you cannot click on Bedlam to level your ulti up, you must click on Terrorize.

Bedlam should be visible at all times, and not only appear after learning Terrorize. And you should be able to level your ulti by pressing either of the two.

---
##Terrorize
---
#1. Terrorize's pre-cast sound and visuals can be spammed endlessly

The spell has a loud sound during its cast time. That sound can be spammed endlessly. It should fade out upon canceling the cast, like how e.g. Requiem of Souls does it. An enemy Dark Willow can spam it, too. Both, the cast and the area sound are audible to enemies.

The same goes for its visual effect. When spammed, it can comletely blacken out portions of the ground.

Major bug with Medusa's Mystic Snake|self.DotA2|~Medusa's Mystic Snake doesn't steal mana from illusions. It used to do it and it's not doing it anymore. It wasn't mentioned in the last few patch notes (6.86 or 6.87) so I presume it's a bug.

This means one of Medusa's ways to deal with illusions (HER MAIN COUNTER) just vanished for no reason. This is a HUGE bug.~|bug

[BUG] Rubick can't steal black hole if the last spell he steal is midnight pulse.|self.DotA2|~Match id : 2637903680

You can see it around the last 2-3 minutes. It also happens earlier which makes us lose team fights. Enigma doesn't have aghs so it isn't some weird interactions with the added midnight pulse to black hole.

You can reproduce it easily in test lobby. Spawn Rubick and Enigma (enemy), level them up. Cast midnight pulse and steal it. Then cast black hole and steal it. The stolen spell will remain midnight pulse.

EDIT: It is fixed in today's (12 Sep) patch. Thanks volvo~|bug

Hero3: Everything wrong with Ancient Apparition, part 2/2|self.DotA2|~[part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5v8lsa/hero2_everything_wrong_with_ancient_apparition/)

Here is part 2, covering other stuff, like minor glitches, inconsistencies, inconveniences and some suggestions.

Note that most of these are not considered bugs. They are things that I think are hindering the hero unecessarily and would be nice if they were changed/tweaked.

#1. Make Chilling Touch not slow upon attacking buildings/wards

The ability does not work against buildings and wards, but it still slows your attack speed when attacking those.

For this reason, the ability to manually remove the buff was added (left-click it to remove it). There is a much better solution to this though. It would be much more benificial for AA and his team when the buff would simply not slow your attacks upon attacking buildings or wards. It could work similar to Focus Fire, which applies its effect only when attacking a specific target.

#2. Cold Feet's initial debuff has no visible timer on the status debuff icon

Expiring or timed modifiers usually indicate their duration on the ability icon. Cold Feet's initial debuff however looks like a permanent/passive/aura buff. It should show a timer like e.g. Last Word.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acfTITYiZDs), you can see how Last Word's debuff runs out in the status bar, its red borders indicate the duration. Cold Feet does not do this.

---

#3. Ice Blast cannot be leveled up while the Release sub-spell is active.

This is because of the issue mentioned in the first post, it has only 1 level. However, even if it would have 3 levels, it needs to made levelable. Because some such spells cannot be leveled either, despite having the correct amount of levels.

Other affected spells are: 

* Nightmare
* Tether
* Astral Spirit
* Illuminate
* Illuminate (Spirit Form)
* Song of the Siren
* Icarus Dive
* Sun Ray
* Telekinesis
* Chakram
* Snowball

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1M5ieQuFXk)

---

#4. Ice Blast's Release sub-spell does not have its own icon

It currently shares the same icon with Ice Blast itself. Most other sub-spells have their own icons.

Besides Ice Blast, these sub-spells also share this fate (no own icon): 

* X Marks the Spot's Return
* Snowball's Launch Snowball
* Primal Spring's Spring Early

The main issue here is, new players may not notice that there is a sub-spell. How often does it happen that your Tusk doesn't launch his snowball earlier, or your Kunkka doesn't return the target earlier? If it would have its own icon, maybe they'd notice there is a new spell.

(PS: 3 out of 4 of these spells already have custom icons from cosmetic items, they'd need fitting icons as well)

[Image] (http://i.imgur.com/hCHTOD3.jpg), on the left side, we have all spell icons and the icons of their sub-spells. On the right side, we have the 4 spells with no unique sub-spell icon (and the cosmetic item custom versions)

---

#5. Enemies affected by Ice Blast can be denied by their allies/by neutrals

They cannot deny themselves while affected by Ice Blast, AA gets the kill credits if the shatter was caused by self-inflicted damage. But allies can deny them still. The shatter only checks if it was self-inflicted damage.

According to DotA 1, only AA and his team should be able to get the kill credits. If the shattering was caused by the enemy, an ally of the enemy, or a neutral unit, AA should get the credits.

This is a case where I think the DotA1 behavior was better. Because currently, an enemy Oracle can easily prevent kills this way. Neutrals can be abused quite reliably as well.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMQ5HvtYH6A)

---

#6. Ice Blast can debuff invulnerable units

Invulnerability should be a "safe spot" for units. And it basically is, with only very very few spells being able to affect invulnerable units (such as Meat Hook). Ice Blast, for some reason, cannot be dodged with invulnerability.

It should not be able to debuff invulnerable units in my opinion, so that it can be dodged like many other spells.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu6g0a_49IA)

#7. Cold Feet does not have infinite charges in -wtf mode

Quite annoying. Charge-based spells are supposed to have infinite charges in free spells mode. But all spells which gain their charges do not have infinite charges.

Affected spells are:

* Cold Feet (charges gained via talent)
* Homing Missile (charges gained via talent)
* Rupture (charges gained via Aghanim's Scepter)
* Demonic Purge (charges gained via Aghanim's Scepter)

All other charge-based spells have infinite charges. They are also charge-based from the beginning and don't gain it later on in a match.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fy2z_2PPKM)

---

#8. Ice Blast's launch sound doesn't play when launched on death by Rubick or illusions

When the caster of Ice Blast dies, the ice ball gets released immediately if it wasnt releasead yet. For Ancient Apparition, it plays the launch sound when this happens. But for Rubick or illusions, the launch sound is not played.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siLq5ZayGPA)

---

#9. Tooltip stuff

Lots of tooltip stuff

**Cold Feet:**

- Cold Feet description could be reworded to be clearer.
- Cold Feet has an unnecessary note telling its total damage
- Cold Feet has an unnecessary note telling its tick interval (with an outdated value)
- Add Cold Feet note telling that it can't be cast on units already affected by it
- Add Cold Feet note telling that the spell completely cancels when walking out of range once
- Change "DAMAGE PER TICK" to "DAMAGE PER SECOND", making the damage interval note redundant
- Add "CHARGE RESTORE TIME" To the traits, since the cooldown disappears once the charge talent is chosen, leaving the player no info about how long it takes to recharge (it should only appear when the talent is chosen)


**Ice Vortex:**

- Reworded Ice Vortex description to tell that it reduces magic resistance (currently says it amplifies magical damage done against the target), and removed duration from description, moved to traits
- Remov Ice Vortex note saying that it doesn't affect spell immune enemies (tooltip header already tells spell immunity interaction)
- Add Ice Vortex note telling Ice Vortex stacking behavior (doesnt stack)
- Add Ice Vortex note telling about its 200 radius ground vision
- Add Ice Vortex note about its debuff lingering
- Chang "INCREASED MAGIC DAMAGE" to "MAGIC RESISTANCE REDUCTION" for accuracy and consistancy
- Add VORTEX DURATION to traits


**Chilling Touch:**

- Remov duration and "ancient apparition always receives the buff" from Chilling Touch description (mov cd to traits and the other sentence to notes).
- Reword Chilling Touch's first note about its damage being separate to be clearer
- Reword Chilling Touch's second note about it only working against creeps and heroes to also tell its interaction vs units it doesn't affect (still applies slow)
- Add Chilling Touch note telling it always buffs the caster (moved here from the description and reworded to not use hero names because Rubick)
- Chang "ATTACK SPEED: -20" to "ATTACK SPEED SLOW: 20"
- Add DURATION to traits

**Ice Blast:**

- Slighty reword Ice Blast description to say it prevents health regen, and not regen in general (doesnt prevent mana regen)
- Reword Ice Blast note about its aoe growth to be more clear
- Add Ice Blast note about the initial tracer (visibility to enemies)
- Reword Ice Blast note telling it only shatters heroes, to it only debuffs heroes, while creeps and illus are only hit by the impact damage
- Reword Ice Blast note about its hp freeze to say all kind of heals, instead of most
- Expand Ice Blast note about its kill credit stuff
- Change "DAMAGE" to "IMPACT DAMAGE", because it applies burst and dot damage and this trait is refering to the burst damage

**Release:**

- Add 3 levels to the Release sub-spell, so ALT-clicking it shows the correct level (needs to be coded to level up together with Ice Blast)


**Modifiers:**

- Reword Cold Feet initial modifier to get rid of "you" and "will"
- Reword Cold Feet stun modifier to get rid of hero names (because Rubick)
- Add description to Cold Feet charges modifier, copied from other charge-based spells' modifiers
- Reword Ice Vortex modifier to say it reduces magic resistance, to get rid of "will" and added values
- Reword Chilling Touch modifier to get rid of "will" and to fit the style of most other modifiers
- Reword Ice Blast modifier to get rid of "will"

Followup on Void: There seems to be 3 major bugs which make void extremely strong.|self.DotA2|~[My last post which you can read here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/2ggj1z/the_real_problem_with_faceless_void/) was pretty controversial. I read through most of it to see what is really wrong with the hero. And while at it and surfing the DotaDev forums, I noticed that Void has 3 major bugs relating to his Chornosphere initiation, so I thought I would share this with you guys.

First bug, is that Time Walk move too fast.
http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=131837  
Apparantly, Time Walk travels equivalent to 3000ms, instead of the intended 2600ms. That is a 1.15x increase compared to the intended speed. This makes it harder to react to a Time Walk initiation than intended.

Second bug, is that Chronosphere is missing the intended 0.1 second buildup time. http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=113018  
In WC3DotA, void is suppose to have a 0.1 second buildup time before Chronosphere, instead of it being instant (after cast point). This buildup time is kind of similar to Requiem, Teleport, or Primal Split, in where you can actually disable the hero to stop the effect from occurring. This means that instead of a 0.35 cast point like his other skills, he should essentially have a 0.45 cast point for Chronosphere. Combined with the above, this makes reacting to a TimeWalk->Chronosphere much more difficult that in WC3DotA, which probably is not intended.

Finally, the third bug is where Chronosphere lingers for an extra 0.5 seconds than intended. http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=145653  
This means that instead of 4/4.5/5 (4/5/6) second disable, it is actually 4.5/5/5.5 (4.5/5.5/6.5) second disable, which is actually a huge difference. It allows a Void with just MoM PT to get in an extra hit during the disable.

These bugs are actually a huge buff to Void, and he might not even need a nerf if these are fixed. Please tell me your opinions.~|bug

(hopefully) all 7.06f bugs|self.DotA2|~4 bugs

#1. Tombstone unit health was not updated

The tombstone still has 6/8/10/14 health. It needs to be increased to 8/10/12/16, in order for heroes to need 4/5/6/8 hits. Currently, it still dies to 3/4/5/7 hits

As you can see in [this image] (http://i.imgur.com/dunMoJs.png), it was updated in the ability file (which is for the description, basically), but not in the unit file

[video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0e7ZFM-kY0)

---
#2. Helm of the Dominator change was applied wrong

The changelog says "*Helm of the Dominator: Attack Speed* ***Aura*** *increased from 10 to 15*". However, the change was wrongly applied to the passive bonus the owner gets, instead of the aura bonus.


[image] (http://i.imgur.com/cZngU01.png)

---

#4. Chain Frost does not get reflected by Lotus Orb/Spell Shield anymore

Previously, Chain Frost got reflected upon projectile launch. It reacted on the initial mini-stun. Now that that stun is gone, it fully bypasses Lotus Orb.

It should now trigger on projectile impact against the *primary target*, just like how any other bouncing spell does (well.. except for Spirit Lance, which was never fixed either)

[video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL6XVE8w_2s)

---

#4. Chain Frost tooltip still mentions a mini-stun

Nothing to add. Simple tooltip error.

[image] (http://i.imgur.com/hbzytq3.png)

---

###Bonus: As mentioned before, Spirit Lance's interaction with Lotus/Linken's

Currently, the spell gets blocked *completely* by Linken's Sphere, no matter if it is the primary or a secondary target. It should either only get *fully* blocked when the primary target has Linken's, or only gets its effects blocked (regardless of primary or secondary target), but continue jumping.

The same goes for spell immunity/invulnerability/hiding. Currently, the projectile just fizzles away when any of the targets turn spell immune, invulnerable or becomes hidden. In these cases, its effects should get blocked, but it should continue bouncing.

A few weeks ago, Shuriken Toss got fully fixed in these regards. It had the exact same issues vs linkens/lotus/spell immunity/invul/hiding, and it all got fixed for it.

In short: Spirit Lance should:

* not stop bouncing when blocked by Linken's Sphere on any target
* ignore Lotus Orbs of secondary targets
* not stop bouncing when any target turns spell immune before impact
* not stop bouncing when any target turns invulnerable before impact
* not stop bouncing when any target becomes hidden before impact
* Why? Because it's literally the only bouncing spell which stops bouncing/procs secondary lotus orbs.

When I was compiling this list, I realize that Valve is really inconsistent with the tooltips wordings and descriptions. Skills sometimes have damage numbers in the description, and sometimes not. I hope something could be done with this.~|bug

##Bugs

#1. Nightmare does not end upon taking attack damage

As we all know, Nightmare is supposed to get canceled upon taking damage. However, there is a source of damage which is completely ignored by it.

If you take attack damage while nightmared, you do not wake up. This is heavily abusable with some heroes who have spells which force attacks. The following effects do not cancel Nightmare:

1. Any regular attack projectile (hitting after the invulnerability)
2. Sleight of Fist
3. Gyro's Side Gunner
4. Moment of Courage
5. Boundless Strike
6. Stifling Dagger
7. Assassinate
8. Geminate Attack

This is caused by some old remnant codes which are not needed by the spell. It is coded to ignore attack damage because as Bane was released, Nightmare was transfered on attack hit, not attack start. But since it was fixed to transfer on attack start, it is no longer needed.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro4k9vzRny4)

---

#2. Nightmare does not end upon taking damage from active attack modifier

This one is even weirder than the previous one. Attacks not ending it is kind of understandable how that happened. But this is not.

Damage done by *active* attack modifier (passive ones work fine) do not wake up nightmared units. This even includes damage over time effects.

Damage from the following effects do not end nightmare:

1. Petrify (Prowler Shaman ability)
2. Searing Arrows (hitting after the invulnerability)
3. Infernal Blade
4. Impetus (hitting after the invulnerability)
5. Burning Spear
6. Liquid Fire
7. Tidebringer
8. Arcane Orb (hitting after the invulnerability)
9. Glaives of Wisdom (hitting after the invulnerability)
10. Poison Attack

A very long time ago, cleave had this bug as well, where it bypassed nightmare, and that was fixed. I assume it was bugged for all passive modifiers. Tidebringer is bugged again since it became an active attack modifier.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKfhSLu60OA)

---

#3. Nightmare heavy inconsistency with bouncing & multi attacks

Nightmare's behavior with bouncing and multi attacks is a mess. So we have the following spells and this is how they interact with Nightmare:

1. Luna's Moon Glaives: Completely ignore nightmared units
2. Witch Doctor's Death Ward (upgraded): Fully affects nightmared units, bouncing on them, damaging and ending Nightmare upon damaging
3. Drow Ranger's Marksmanship (upgraded): Fully affects nightmared units, bouncing on them, damaging and ending Nightmare upon damaging
4. Medusa's Split Shot: Completely ignores nightmared units
5. Gyrocopter's Flak Cannon: Fully affects nightmared units, targeting them, but ending nightmare on attack launch, not upon damaging
6. Shadow Shaman's Mass Serpent Ward (upgraded): Completely ignores nightmared units

So there are 2 differen behaviors, either they affect them or they don't. The effects of these abilities are identical as well (especially moon glaives + death ward and split shot + flak cannon), them behaving differently in such regards isn't a good thing.

At least Moon Glaives + Death Ward should behave the same and Split Shot + Flak Cannon should behave the same. Also, if Flak Cannon is kept this way, it should at least end nightmare upon damaging, not upon launching the attack.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmW5-4BTdWo)

---

#4. Nightmare is not properly dispellable

Since 7.00, Nightmare is supposed to be dispellable. However ,its modifier is acting differently, making it undispellable half of the time.

Normally, a modifier appears as a buff when placed on allies and as a debuff when placed on enemies. This also decides who can purge stuff off of who. This is the default modifier/dispel behavior of the game. But Nightmare is *always* placed as a debuff, no matter who it is cast on. As a result, you cannot dispel Nightmare off of enemies.

The same bug (Nightmare always being placed as a debuff) also causes another bug where Bane can get assist points for dying allies. The assist system gives you points for any hero who dies which you put a debuff on. Since Nightmare always counts as a debuff, a dying nightmared ally grants you assist points.

Furthermore, the invulnerability modifier of Nightmare is undispellable. So if you purge Nightmare off, the target still stays invulnerable for 1 second. Also strange, the invulnerability modifier follows the default modifier rule: Appears as a buff on allies and debuff on enemies.

The image shows Nightmare cast on self. You can see the nightmare is red and the invulnerability is green. Both should be green when cast on self/allies.

#5. Nightmare triggers Linken's Sphere & Lotus Orb upon getting transfered

Linken's Sphere and Lotus Orb (and Spell Shield) are supposed to block/reflect spells targeted on you. So they should only react on Nightmare when Bane directly casts it on them.

But currently, they also proc upon attacking a nightmared enemy unit. This should not happen. It causes the following issues:

1. When reflected, it puts Bane asleep, even when he was not nightmared. This can be abused to instantly disable Bane for a long time
2. When reflected, Bane loses his Nightmare End sub-spell. For the rest of the game, it only appears upon nightmaring self, but not upon nightmaring others.
3. It is inconsistent. Only attacking nightmared enemies procs Linken's/Lotus. Attacking nightmared allies does not. It does not matter in which team Bane is.
4. It is also inconsistent with Bane's Scepter upgrade. Linken's/Lotus do not proc upon attacking Bane while he channels Fiend's Grip.

Attacking a Nightmared unit should not proc Linken's Sphere/Lotus Orb.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8wuchWmX54)

---

#6. Nightmare's vision removal does not work against Monkey King

Nightmare sets your vision to 0 for its duration, so that only your model is visible inside the fog while nightmared.

Currently, this effect does not work on Monkey King while he sits on a tree. The vision effect of Tree Dance overrides Nightmare's effect.

As a comparison, no other vision effect overrides it (moon shard, darkness, arctic burn, lunar blessing, shapeshift)

Monkey King should lose vision as well, even while on a tree

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqIo218Uoyc)

---

#7. Fiend's Grip deals too much damage based on player slot

Fiend's Grip is supposed to deal 5 (7 when upgraded) damage/mana drain instances

However, based on player slot, it deals 6 (8) instances.

* If Bane is in any of Radiant player slots, Fiend's Grip deals 6 (8) instances against light blue and dark green, 5 (7) against pink, olive and brown.
* If Bane is in pink, olive or brown, Fiend's Grip deals 6 (8) instances against all 5 Radiant slots.
* If Bane is in light blue or dark green, Fiend's Grip deals 5 (7) instances against all 5 Radiant slots.

Player slot should not matter, it should always deal 5 (7) instances.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nMDuycfblk)

---

#8. Bane does not get attacked by towers/wards while channeling Fiend's Grip

Whe scepter upgraded, units are not supposed to auto-attack bane. But towers and wards, which cannot be afflicted with Nightmare, don't attack him either.

Units which cannot be nightmared should attack Bane normally.

Wards, since they are player-controlled, can still be ordered to attack him. But towers, which are AI controlled, never attack him.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13hnIaXdh8I)

---

#9. Fiend's Grip does not fully pierce spell immunity

Fiend's Grip is supposed to pierce spell immunity. But its damage portion currently does not, which causes several inconsistencies.

As a comparison, Dismember (which is essentially a short Fiend's Grip) does fully pierce, including its damage. So it still can cancel Recalls on spell immune targets, and Blade Mail still reflects its damage when the target is spell immune.

Fiend's Grip does not deal its damage at all, despite piercing spell immunity. It should apply its damage normally.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wItBNyvuIzo)

---

#10. Casting multiple Fiend's Grips on one target causes it to malfunction

An issue which only matters in same hero mode, or when Bane and Rubick cast it on the same neutral creep

Currently, casting Fiend's Grip on an already gripped unit interferes with the first cast. The first cast stops draining mana and stops dealing damage. The scond cast takes over the debuff. However, when either of them end, the other gets canceled as well. So if the first caster cancels his cast, the 2nd caster stops as well, but continues channeling nothing.

Each cast of Fiend's Grip should place its own independent debuff on the target.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U9tA6xDZ0w)

---

#11. Bane illusions have lvl 1 Nightmare when spawned while the sub-spell is active
# ALT-clicking Nightmare always says it's level 1 when done while the sub-spell is active

This happens because the sub-spell has only 1 level, instead of having 3 levels like the main spell.

**Repro:**

1. Have Nightmare on level 2, 3 or 4
2. Cast Nightmare
3. Spawn illusions of Bane while Nightmare is still running
4. Also ALT-click Nightmare meanwhile

**Result:** The illus have level 1 Nightmare, instead of 2/3/4. ALT-clicking it also says it's on level 1, instead of 2/3/4.

**Expected behavior:** Illus should copy the correct level. ALT-clicking should also show the correct level. The sub-spell should have 4 levels like the main spell and its level should be set equal to Nightmare's level.


Other spells with the same bug:

* Tether
* Ice Blast
* Telekinesis
* Song of the Siren

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPzeN12RyJY)

---

#12. Nightmare cannot be leveled up while the sub-spell is active.

This is because of the issue mentioned in the first post, it has only 1 level. However, even if it would have 4 levels, it needs to made levelable. Because some such spells cannot be leveled either, despite having the correct amount of levels.

Other affected spells are: 

* Ice Blast
* Tether
* Astral Spirit
* Illuminate
* Illuminate (Spirit Form)
* Song of the Siren
* Icarus Dive
* Sun Ray
* Telekinesis
* Chakram
* Snowball

##Bugs
---

#1. Drunken Brawler ensured evasion does not work at all

Straight-forward. The ensured crit timer procs, but does not evade the attack.

**Repro:**

1. Learn Drunken Brawler
2. Get attacked by an enemy

**Result:** The attack puts the ensured evasion on cooldown (icon turns yellow). But the attack is not evaded at all.


**Expected:** If the attack had no True Strike, it gets evaded by the ensured evasion.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RYrP2jiXXo)

---

#2. Drunken Brawler's ensured crit malfunctions when attack-canceling

This used to work for a while after the ensured crit was added. It got broken about a year ago. The ensured crit simply does not proc anymore when attack-canceling too often.

This bug heavily cripples Brewmaster's last-hit abilities during the laning stage. The supposed reliable crit is unreliable.

**Repro:**

1. Learn Drunken Brawler
2. Start an attack on an enemy, but cancel it a few times before hitting
3. As a  comparison, when ready again, cancel the attack once and hit with the  2nd attack

**Result:** The ensured crit is not applied when attack-canceling at least 3 times quickly. It does get applied when canceling once or twice.


**Expected:** The ensured crit should be applied, no matter how often the attack gets canceled.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N2jVl6rsoM)

---

#3. Primal Split Earth gets stuck when Primal Split splits during knockbacks 

Potentially game-breaking. The Earth element cannot move after Primal Split resolves during a non-disabling knockback (deaf blast, es pull or kick, ghostship drag, etc), which makes it pretty much useless, and also easier to kill.

**Repro:**

1. Begin casting Primal Split
2. During the cast time, get hit by Deafening Blast
3. Time it so that the split finishes during the knockback

**Result:** Earth gets stuck on the hidden Brewmaster, presumably because the knockback cancels Primal Split's periodic movement of Brewmaster.


**Expected:** Earth is not stuck. Band-aid solution: turn Brewmaster phased during Primal Split

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHJC6ZzlnMw)

---

#4. When Primal Split ends during Walrus Punch/Kick, Brewmaster's facing angle is messed up

Also potentially game-breaking, as this bug can make you virtually "invisible" when timed right, although intentionally timing it is something that probably won't happen, since it would be a disadvantage for Tusk's team. What happens here is, as Primal Split expires, Brewmaster's facing angle is set equal to the element he respawns on. This includes the z direction. Walrus Punch/Kick change your z direction as well, to create that rotating effect, so when expiring during it, Brewmaster may face up/downwards, or even backwards.

**Repro:**

1. Wait until the last second of Primal Split's duration
2. Before the spell expires, cast Walrus Punch/Kick on the element Brewmaster will appear on
3. Time it so that the spell expires while the spirit is in the air

**Result:** Brewmaster's facing angle equals *exactly* that of the element, so that it may face up/downwards, or even be spinned entirely so that he now is under ground.


**Expected:** Brewmaster's x/y facing should copy the element, and z should not

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTig4DGgH2M)

---

#5. Box-selecting the Primal Split spirits doesn't always put Earth as first

One of the most common and annoying things on Brewmaster. The order of his elements is sometimes messed up. It sometimes selects Storm over Earth, while it should always select Earth over Storm. Fire is correctly always the last.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Primal Split
2. Check whether you have to TAB to Earth

**Result:** Sometimes the order is Earth->Storm->Fire, sometimes it's Storm->Earth->Fire


**Expected:** It should always be Earth->Storm->Fire

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwwb3MqjmhU)

---

#6. Thunder Clap uses creep duration vs creep-heroes instead of hero duration

One for AdmiralBulldog, I'm sure he knows this too well.

Usually, when a spell has a hero duration and a creep duration, it uses the hero duration for creep-heroes. But Thunder Clap uses the creep-duration for creep-heroes.

**Repro:**

1. summon a spirit bear
2. hit it with Brewmaster's thunder clap
3. check how long it lasts

**Result:** The slow lasts 8 seconds, using creep duration


**Expected:** The slow should lasts 4 seconds, using hero duration

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_zWBXStwLk)

These spells also use creep duration: frost arrows, brood spider poison sting, spells of neutrals

As a comparison, these use hero duration: Storm Cyclone, BB goo, timelock, dismember, demonic purge, slardar bash

---

#7. Primal Split's periodic moving of Brewmaster can be canceled by teleports

Brewmaster can get teleported during Primal Split. Some of you may say that this is intended, but I'd like to disagree here.

One argument is "you can use this to save your Brewmaster". And here is why this is a bad argument:

Respawning at the tp location might sometimes be a good thing. If you cast Primal Split to prevent death, it makes an easier escape. However, to do this, your ally has to time his teleport, which is not that easy during fights. And Primal Split on its own should already be enough to keep you alive. You have 3 different units, and only one of them has to survive. One of them is tanky, the other one has invisibility and a strong disable, and the last one runs very fast. The teleport doesn't make a significant difference here, because either way, you have to keep at least one spirit alive. So if you know that they won't be able to kill all 3 spirits anyway, you don't need to worry about surviving, so the tp was unnecessary. If you know they can kill all 3 spirits, you have to keep one alive, regardless of whether you got tp'd or not.

Here are other disadvantages of getting teleported:

* Auras are no longer bestowed around your spirits. The spirits don't scale well into the late game, since they are non-scaling units. Therefore, items like Assault Cuirass, Vlads and Radiance, or defensive items like Shiva's Guard, or even Gem of True Sight are important for the spirits in the late-game. Getting teleported away also takes away the auras from the spirits, making them significantly weaker, and may allow enemies to escape easier (e.g. with invisibility if you were holding the gem).
* You stop gaining experience from kills happening around your spirits. Usually, kills happen where you cast your ultimate, so when you get teleported away, you will miss out on a lot of gold and xp if you don't get any last hits. You won't get any xp or gold when your hero sits at the foutain thanks to Chen's tp, while your spirits fight somewhere on the map.
* The ensured vision around your spirits is lost. If you have vision-impairing enemies like Bane, your hero's vision doesn't help when it sits at the fountain. It would help when it was centered on the spirits still.

**Repro:**

1. Cast a teleporting spell on Brewmaster (Chen, Kotl, Wisp, Underlord or Disruptor)
2. Quickly Cast Primal Split before the teleport resolves

**Result:** When the teleport resolves after the split, it ends the periodic movement of Primal Split


**Expected:** The periodic movement should not get canceled, Primal Split should pull Brewmaster back immediately

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgxQVblwMSE)

---

#8. Drunken Brawler ensured crit procs & gets wasted on units it can't crit

This should not happen, because it makes as much sense as being able to target e.g. magic missile on a spell immune unit. It does nothing but waste the cooldown. Other passive abilities which cant affect certain units do not go on cooldown against them either. For example, Jinada doesn't go on cd vs wards or buildings, so why should Drunken Brawler?

As a comparison, the ensured crit was fixed to not get wasted on missed attacks. Simlarly, the ensured evasion got fixed to not get wasted on attacks with True Strike.

**Repro:**

1. Learn Drunken Brawler
2. Attack an ally, a ward or a building

**Result:** Ensured crit procs on things it cannot crit, getting wasted


**Expected:** Ensured crit should not proc on things it cannot crit

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pucj7qDFhlE)

---

#9. Brewmaster does not re-appear exactly at Earth's location upon expiring

A very minor thing. When Primal Split ends, Brewmaster is supposed to appear at the spirit's location (Earth->Storm->Fire). But due to collisions, Brewmaster gets pushed aside after re-appearing, putting about 50-100 range off-set.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Primal Split
2. Wait for it to expire
3. Closely observe Brewmaster's position compared to the spirit he appeared from

**Result:** Brewmaster gets pushed aside after re-appearing due to collsion. Does not happen when re-appearing on Fire, due to it being permanently phased, or when re-appearing on Storm under Wind Walk, due to Wind Walk granting phase.


**Expected:** Brewmaster should not get pushed aside. Band-aid solution: Make Brewmaster phased during Primal Split

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W7HwbfC8jw)

[image for better readability] (http://i.imgur.com/jUOoobt.jpg)

---

#10. Rubick does not get de-selected when casting Primal Split

During Primal Split, the caster is supposd to be unselectable. This does not work for Rubick currently.

**Repro:**

1. Steal Primal Split with Rubick
2. Cast Primal Split with Rubick

**Result:** Rubick stays selected and can be still selected afterwards


**Expected:** Just like Brew, Rubick should not be selectable during Primal Split, attempting to do so should redirect the selectiont o the 3 spirits

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMOOb1FFvec)

---

#11. Shadow Walk/Wind Walk/Shadow Blade/Vendetta apply dmg to every hit during fade time

I know many of you do not consider this a bug, because it has been like this since Brewmaster existed in Dota 2.

Wind Walk applies its damage to every hit during its fade times, without breaking the invisibility, allowing you to apply its damage multiple times with a single cast.

For Storm, this means you can double the damage out put per cast, which extremely boosts its damage output. The spell has a mere 4 seconds cooldown, and does 220 backstab damage on level 3. So when done right, you can dish out about 300-500 (2x backstab+2x att dmg, and considering some armor reduction) damage per Wind Walk cast, every 4seconds, which is a huge damage boost.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Wind Walk with Storm
2. During the fade time, perform an attack

**Result:** The attack performed during the fade time applies the backstab damage without breaking the invisibility, so the backstab can be used again


**Expected:** The backstab damage is only applied on attacks done after the fade time. Attacks done during the fade time should not apply the damage, just like how attacks done during the fade time don't break the invisibility

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npGwiYUxWCs)

Note: Bounty Hunter, Shadow Blade and Nyx Assassin (not relevant as of now, but might be in the future) have this bug as well.

---

#12. Fire's Permanent Immolation is not disabled by Break

It's a passive ability. It should be disabled. There is no reason not to. As a comparison, Earth's Demolish is disabled.

**Repro:**

1. Hit the Fire element with Silver Edge
2. Stay within Immolation's range

**Result:** Permanent Immolation continues to damage nearby units during Break


**Expected:** Break should disable Permanent Immolation

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tE1KvNFhiA)

---

#13. Stashed items cannot be locked while having creep-heroes selected

For some reason, locking and unlocking items for combining requires your current selected unit to have an inventory, which makes no sense. So you can still normally drop or sell stashed items while having your brewlings selected, but you cannot lock/unlock them.

**Repro:**

1. Have a creep-hero selected
2. Attempt to lock or unlock stashed items

**Result:** Items cannot be locked while having units without inventories selected


**Expected:** Item locking should not depend on whether the unit can carry items or not

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl29gZEmG0w)

---

#14. Storm Cyclone can be cast on Roshan, wasting mana/cd & causing audio bug

Cyclone uses a loop sound. So when it gets instantly dispelled it gets stuck, because it is bound  to the debuff and doesn't register it getting dispelled when it happens immediately. Roshan has 100% disable resistance, so it gets immediately dispelled.

This is also somewhat abusable. You can use this to check whether Roshan moves in his pit, since the sound can be heard  through the fog by allies.

**Repro:**

1. Break Roshan's Spell Block
2. Cast Storm's Cyclone on Roshan

**Result:** Cyclone is castable on Roshan, doing nothing but wasting cd and mana, and getting its sound stuck


**Expected:** Cyclone should not be castable on Roshan, or at least the loop sound shouldnt get stuck

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DUnP0hj4gI)

---

#15. Can't reflect some projectile spells back when the caster is spell immune

Lotus Orb is supposed to reflect projectile-based spells, even when the original caster is spell immune. The projectile would then fizzle (or apply its aoe effect if it has one) on them when still spell immune on impact, but would fully affect them if the immunity wears off before impact.

**Repro:**

1. Get a Lotus Orb and cast it on self
2. Have a spell immune enemy
3. Have that spell immune enemy cast one of the following spells on you: Rod of Rod of Atos, Adaptive Strike Hurl Boulder (Mud Golem), Hurl Boulder (Primal Split Earth)

**Result:** Lotus Orb does not reflect the spell. No projectile is launched.


**Expected:** Lotus Orb should reflect the spell, launching the projectile back, and eventually affect it or fizzle, depending on whether they are still spell immune on impact or not.

## Tooltip stuff
---

**Thunder Clap:**

1. Description says "enemy land units", but it affects flying units as well. The "land" part should be removed.
2. Typo in the +2s Thunder Clap talent, it says "Thunderlap", instead of "Thunder Clap"
3. The +75 damage and +2s duration talent bonuses are not added to the tooltip (+2s should be added to hero and creep duration)
4. The Earth element's Thunder Clap is unable to show the talent bonuses (just adding the linking stuff to the ability in the npc file does not work)

**Drunken Haze:**

1. Has sentence structure repetition ("causing their..., causing their")
2. Doesn't mention cast range in traits

**Drunken Brawler:**

1. Doesn't say that it pierces spell immunity in the header
2. Says "avoid attacks", instead of "evade attacks"
3. Second sentence for the guaranteed crit/evasion is completely out of style (using "you" and "will")
4. Trait says "DODGE CHANCE", instead of "EVASION" or "EVASION CHANCE" (items and other abilities say "EVASION")

**Primal Split:**

1. When holding Aghanim's Scepter, All of the spirits' spell are 1 level too high, and show level 4 while on level 3. Their tooltip orange glow stops working as well. Only Fire's Permanent Immolation is limited correctly to 3 levels.
2. Add "SPLIT TIME" to the traits, below the "DURATION".
3. Drop the "adept at survival" part of the first sentence. It makes no sense (and we need to shorten it a bit based on the following things)
4. Change "the end of their summoned timer" to "the end of their duration" (more shortening for the following)
5. Add descriptions for the 3 elements, briefly tell what their spells do. Use color-coding similar to Elder Dragon Form (see image for example)
6. Add text to the Primal Split modifier, it's currently blank. Best would "If any of them survive until the end of their duration, the Brewmaster is reborn.", copied from the spell description.

**Summons abilities:**

1. All of their spells could make use of better descriptions, as the current ones are lacking, mainly in style.
2. None of their spells have lore texts.
3. Hurl Boulder, Cyclone & Dispel Magic: missing cast range in traits
4. Wind Walk: Doesn't say it pierces spell immunity in the header
5. Wind Walk: Doesn't mention FADE TIME in traits

ALT note suggestions:

**Drunken Brawler:**

* New ALT note: Guaranteed evasion does not work against True Strike
* New ALT note: Fully works for illusions, including the guaranteed crit/evasion

**Primal Split:**

Rework the ALT notes:

* First note should say that Brewmaster is periodically moved along with the elements in this order, assuming they are alive: Earth->Storm->Fire
* Second note should say that all of Brewmaster's auras are bestowed around the element he currently follows (current note says that auras always follow Earth, which is incorrect)
* Third note should say that Brewmaster takes the place of the element he followed the last
* New ALT note: The 3 spirits are treated as heroes and are ancient creeps

**Summons abilities:**

* New Hurl Boulder ALT note: Can be disjointed
* New Dispel Magic ALT note: Affects invulnerable units
* New Wind Walk ALT note: Damage is directly added to Storm's attack damage (works with crits and lifesteal)
* New Wind Walk ALT note: Actions performed during the fade time don't break the invis

Bug: Riki's ult does one less attack than it should at each level|self.DotA2|I was testing something in demo mode when I noticed this. I restarted the demo multiple times and found that although the ult may give the correct number of attacks initially, it will eventually start giving one less. It appeared as though the attacks were happening at the x.8 second marks of the channeling instead of the x.0 marks.|bug
The "Tiny Avalanche neutrals stacking" bug explained|self.DotA2|~[Regarding this post] (https://np.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6fx3es/possible_tiny_avalanche_glitch/)

First off, it has nothing to do with Avalanche. A level 3 Tiny simply cannot block that specific camp at all. He is *outside the spawn box*.

How is this possible? Two factors:

1. Tiny's base model is a [tiny squared pebble] (http://i.imgur.com/M3VV5tD.png). This square is always at his chest area, so when skilling Grow, it gets higher off the ground.

2. Neutral creep spawn boxes are 3-dimensional. And some of these new neutral creep camps have very short boxes, while all of the old ones and some of the new ones have tall boxes.

The medium camp in Dire's secondary jungle has the shortest box of them all. It is so short, that a Tiny with level 3 Grow cannot block it, because his base model is outside of the box.


[In this album] (https://imgur.com/a/4cbMv), you can see the heavy discrepancy between the spawn box sizes.

[This is the box of the dire secondary forest medium camp] (http://i.imgur.com/7mmO72P.jpg), which levle 3 Grow Tiny cannot block. As a comparison, [this is the radiant secondary forest large camp] (http://i.imgur.com/K35wh27.jpg), which cannot be stacked with any spell, since nothing throws units that high, not even a lethal Walrus Punch.


Fixing these should be extremely easy. It just needs a size adjustment on the z axis to the boxes. Best would be when all boxes had the same height, so that torrent/tornado-stacking them would be consistent.~|bug

##Bugs
---

#1. Ice Blast prevents Track from granting gold

When a hero dies to Ice Blast's shatter while Tracked by Bounty Hunter, it does not grant Track gold to anyone.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Track on an enemy
2. Apply Ice Blast frostbite debuff on the enemy
3. Cause it to shatter by dropping its health below the threshold

**Result:** Track does not grant any gold. The shatter prevents it.


**Expected:** The shatter should not prevent Track from granting gold.

This is the same bug which causes Duel to not grant damage, Reaper's Scythe to not credit Necro, Tempest Double not grant its bounty, etc. That dispel effect should really be removed from Ice Blast, as it creates way more bugs than it fixes.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVu_hjcb6FI)

---

#2. Track does not grant gold to nearby invulnerable or hidden allies

Track is supposed to grant gold to allies which are within 900 range of the target. This works independent from the speed buff it places. However, this does not work when the ally is invulnerable or hidden within range.

This works fine for Gondar himself, who always gains the gold even while invulnerable or hidden.

**Repro:**

1. Pick Storm Spirit
2. Have an ally track an enemy
3. Have the enemy on low health
4. Finish the enemy of by using Ball Lightning's aoe damage

**Result:** Even though you are directly next to the enemy and even killed them, you do not gain Track gold because you were invulnerable during Ball Lightning.


**Expected:** The gold should be granted, regardless of your current status.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBD3cBzLFNU)

---

#3. Track's speed aura affects neutral creeps

Track's AoE speed aura is set to affect "enemies of the debuffed target", instead of "allies of the debuff source". This means it affects neutrals as well.

**Repro:**

1. Get tracked by an enemy Bounty Hunter
2. Walk past neutral creeps
3. Check the neutral creeps' status bar and movement speed

**Result:** The neutrals are affected by the speed aura.


**Expected:** The speed aura should only affect Bounty Hunter and his allies.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1jTGNPewBo)

---

#4. Shuriken Toss bounces ignore invisibility even after dispelling Track

Shuriken is disjointable. Therefore, it should not hit invisible units. This works fully fine when being the primary target of the Shuriken.

But when being a secondary target thanks to Track, it *will* hit you, even if you dispel the track and then turn invisible. It will even hit Slark who uses Shadow Dance, or when using Smoke.


**Repro:**

1. Cast Track on Slark.
2. Use Shuriken Toss on a hero within range of Slark.
3. After the Shuriken bounces and starts flying towards Slark, cast Shadow Dance

**Alternative repro:**

1. Cast Track on an Legion Commander
2. Use Shuriken Toss on a hero within range of Slark.
3. After the Shuriken bounces and starts flying towards Legion, cast Press the Attack to dispel Track
4. Still before the projectile hits, cast Shadow Blade with Legion

**Result:** In both cases, despite being no longer revealed to the enemy and being invisible, Shuriken still hits, damaging and stunning you


**Expected:** The shuriken should get disjointed as soon as the target is no longer revealed, no matter how.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayuJf10bB4k)

---

#5. Shuriken Toss procs Linken's Sphere/Lotus Orb of secondary targets

Linken's Sphere and Lotus Orb are only supposed to proc when being the primary target of a single-target spell. Currently, they proc on the bounces of Shuriken Toss as well. This makes Linken's Sphere hard-counter his Scepter upgrade, since it will make it stop bouncing. Lotus Orb is even worse, and can reflect multiple shurikens with a single cast.

As a comparison, other bouncing spells don't proc Linken's Sphere, or when they proc, they don't stop bouncing. None of them proc Lotus Orb as secondary targets.

**Repro:**

1. Pick any hero and buy Linken's sphere/Lotus Orb
2. Have a enemy Bounty Hunter and get tracked by him
3. Get hit as a secondary target by Shuriken Toss

**Result:** Linken's Sphere blocks the shuriken, so that it does not continue to bounce to other tracked heroes. Lotus Orb reflects the shuriken. If you add Aghanim's Scepter to Bounty Hunter, Lotus Orb may reflect it a second time if it bounces back on you again.


**Expected:** Shuriken Toss should proc Linken's Sphere only when primary target. In this case, it should stop it from bouncing as well. It should completely ignore the spheres of secondary targets. Lotus Orb should also only proc when primary target and ignore bouncing shurikens.

**Note:** Spirit Lance has this bug as well.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH5U-9H5aL8)

---

#6. Shuriken Toss does not bounce off of, or to spell immune heroes

This issue here is what makes Bounty's Scepter upgrade so weak. The Shuriken will stop bouncing when one of its targets turned spell immune. As a comparison, any other bouncing spell (Chain Frost, Mystic Snake, Paralyzing Cask) continue to bounce even when their current target turned spell immune. Forthermore, they also can jump onto spell immune units, using them as "bridges" to continue jumping. Shuriken Toss does not do this.

**Repro1:**

1. Have 2 enemy heroes, one of them with BKB
2. Cast Track on the non-BKB enemy
3. Cas Shuriken on the BKB enemy
4. Activate the BKB before projectile impact

**Repro2:**

1. Have 2 enemy heroes, one of them with BKB
2. Activate BKB on the enemy
3. Cast Track on the BKB'd enemy
4. Cast Shuriken Toss on the non-BKB enemy

**Result:** 

1. The projectile does not bounce off of the now spell immune enemy. It completely disappears.
2. The Shuriken does not bounce onto the spell immune tracked enemy. It completely ignores it.


**Expected:** 

1. The projectile should bounce off of them, without harming it in any way (no damage, no stun). Spell immunity should not disrupt the shuriken's bouncing.
2. The projectile should bounce towards the tracked enemy, regardless of spell immunity. It should not harm it though (no damage, no stun). From here, it should be able to bounce off to other tracked heroes again.

**Note:** Spirit Lance has this issue as well.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjNhjvVhpOE)

---

#7. Shuriken Toss does not bounce off of invulnerable or hidden heroes

Similar to above, but only one way. Bouncing spells continue bouncing even when their current target turns invulnerable or hidden. Shuriken Toss completely fizzles instead. This again heavily increases the amount of heroes who can turn his aghs upgrade useless, and allows heroes to easily counter it with eul's scepter. So as of now, his aghs upgrade is only good aganist a team which does not use spell immunity, invulnerability or hiding, which is quiet rare.


**Repro:**

1. Pick Bounty Hunter and level up Shuriken Toss and Track
2. Create an enemy Outworld Devourer and Bane
3. Cast Track on any of them
4. Cas Shuriken on the same enemy
5. Have the enemy cast Astral Imprisonment/Nightmare on self before the projectile reaches them

**Result:** The projectile does not bounce off of the now hidden or invulnerable enemy. It completely disappears.


**Expected:** The projectile should bounce off of them, without harming it in any way (no damage, no stun). Being hidden or invulnerable should not stop the shuriken from bouncing to other nearby valid targets.

**Note:** Spirit Lance has this issue as well.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxvCJ2tKBC4)

---

#8. Shuriken Toss not bouncing properly if recast before 1st cast finishes

Another bug which cripples a caster Bounty Hunter.

Shuriken Toss is supposed to bounce between tracked units once (twice when upgraded). This works fine, until you throw a second shuriken before the first one finishes.


**Repro:**

1. Track multiple enemy heroes
2. Cast Shuriken Toss
3. Cast Shuriken Toss again

**Result:** The 2nd cast resets the bounce counter of the first cast, so that it can now jump on units it already jumped on again. The second cast ends prematurely, together with the first cast.


**Expected:** Each cast should work independently from each other. Each released Shuriken should bouce exactly once (twice when upgraded) on each nearby tracked enemy.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MTteuBQHvk)

---

#9. Shadow Walk applies damage to every hit during its fade time 

I know many of you do not consider this a bug, because it has been like this since Bounty existed in Dota 2. But it does qualify as a bug according to what the spell tells us it is supposed to do. Also, this was fixed for Silver Edge after its release, indicating it's not intended.

Shadow Walk applies its damage to every hit during its fade times, without breaking the invisibility, allowing you to apply its damage multiple times with a single cast.

For the early game, this means you can put out more damage by leaving Shadow Walk on level 2, since the longer fade time allows you to get off the attack. This means on level 2, you can deal 120 damage per cast, instead of 60, 30 damage more than you could deal on level 3. In the late-game, you can dela 240 damage per cast, instead of 120. When combined with Echo Sabre, you could even pull of a 3x damage by attacking twice during the fade time, and 1 more time to break the invis, dealing 360 extra damage total.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Shadow Walk
2. During the fade time, perform an attack

**Result:** The attack performed during the fade time applies the backstab damage without breaking the invisibility, so the backstab can be used again.


**Expected:** The backstab damage is only applied on attacks done after the fade time. Attacks done during the fade time should not apply the damage, just like how attacks done during the fade time don't break the invisibility.

**Note:** The following spells have this bug as well:

1. Shadow Blade's Shadow Walk (even worse, since ranged heroes can do this, too)
2. Brewmaster's Storm's Wind Walk (a giant damage boost here, because its backstab damage is 220, and it has a 4 second cooldown. This is 440 damage per cast, doable up to 3 times per Primal Split, massing up to 1320 damage)
3. Nyx Assassin's Vendetta (technically. But due to its lack of fade time, this is *currently* not abusable. If it ever gets a fade time added, then this will be extremely strong.)

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npGwiYUxWCs)

---

#10. Shadow Walk's invisibility is lost on attack hit, instead of launch

This matters for ranged heroes only. When Rubick attacks out of Shadow Walk, he remains invisible until the projectile hits. As a comparison, almost other sources of invisibility break on attack launch, not hit.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Shadow Walk as Rubick
2. Attack an enemy
3. Check the timing of the invisibility loss

**Result:** The invisibility is lost on projectile impact.


**Expected:** Just like any other source of invisibility, the invis should be lost on projectile launch.

**Note:** Vendetta, Nature's Guise and Meld have this bug as well. It is especially noticable with Meld, as this bug allows her to even *move during meld*, from projectile launch to impact.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQ3tvomCov0)

---

#11. Shadow Walk's invisibility does not break on missed attacks

Related to the above issue, this is because of the timing of the spell.

All sources of invisibility break when the attack out of the invis misses the target (due to evasion or blind), or have True Strike. Gondar's Shadow Walk is the only one which does not break on missed attacks.


**Repro:**

1. Cast Shadow Walk
2. Attack an enemy Windrunner during Windrun
3. Do the same with other sources of invisibility as a comparison

**Result:** Shadow Walk remains active after the missed attack. Other sources of invis break on the missed attack.


**Expected:** Shadow Walk should break on missed attacks as well.

**Note:** Vendetta and Nature's Guise technically have this bug as well, but it does not matter in these cases, due to the True Strike they grant.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As3heIP901I)

---

#12. Shadow Walk's invisibility does not break upon attacking items

Again, related to the 2 above, caused by the timings.

Attacking items while invisibility breaks the invisibility, since you attacked something. However, this does not the case for Shadow Walk, where you remain invisible despite having performed an attack.


**Repro:**

1. Pick one of the mentioned heroes and level up the mentioned spell
2. Turn invisible with the mention spell
3. Attack an item while invisible
4. Now do the same with any other source of invisibility as a comparison

**Result:** The invisibility of Shadow Walk is not broken upon attacking items. The invisibility of almost any other source does break upon attacking items.


**Expected:** All sources of invis which break on attacks, should break upon attacking items as well. These 3 should not be a random exception to this.

**Note:** Just like before, Vendetta and Nature's Guise have this bug as well.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0_fgNtxkL8)

#13. Jinada goes on cooldown in -wtf mode

The -wtf mode is supposed to disable cooldowns. Jinada still goes on cooldown though. It should not.


**Repro:**

1. Turn on -wtf mode
2. Attack with Jinada

**Result:** Jinada goes on cooldown.


**Expected:** Jinada's Cooldown should not trigger.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siwnh7zkDpY)

## Tooltip stuff
---

1. Shuriken Toss' stun durations are not shown anywhere (default and aghs durations)
2. Shuriken Toss' Scepter text does not say that it increases the stun duration
3. The +75 Shuriken damage talent bonus is not added to the tooltip value
4. Add cast range to Shuriken Toss (Track already has this)
5. Jinada is missing its spell immunity information at the header of the tooltip box
6. Track doesn't say that it grants vision over the target (only says true sight)
7. Track's debuff does not tell what it does. Currently, there is only text for how much gold you are carrying.


ALT note suggestions:

**Shuriken Toss:**

* Note0 "The initial target does not need to be tracked for the Shuriken to bounce." (replaces current note saying it interrupts channeling spells, which is unnecessary)

**Jinada:**

* Note0: "Illusions cannot use Jinada." (new note)

**Shadow Walk:**

* Note0: "Does not interrupt channeling spells on cast." (rewording already existing note, which is currently not very accurate)
* Note1: "Deals its damage in a separate instance, so it is not included in Jinada's or any other critical strike, lifesteal or cleave." (expanding note to include all crits, cleave and lifesteal)
* Note2: "Actions performed during the fade time do not break the invisibility." (new note)

**Track:**

* Note0: "Bounty Hunter always gets the bonus gold, regardless of distance to the target." (rework note)
* Note1: "Allies receive the gold only when within 900 range of the target." (rework note)
* Note2: "It doesn't matter how the target dies, the gold is always granted." (new note)
* Note3: "Track's particle effects are only visible to allies." (make clear that only particles are not visible, the debuff is)
* Note4: "Bonus gold is reliable gold." (unchanged)

---~|bug
MKB bash override Abyssal bash|self.DotA2|~Despite the statement on dota2wiki saying that MKB bash is fully independent from other bashes (http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Abyssal_Blade) I found that if MKB and Abyssal bashes proc in the same attack , only the bash from the first aquired item will be performed.

It could be easily tested : 

1) buy 5 MKBs

2) buy 1 abyssal (you have first to buy the 5 MKBs)

3) attack a hero and observe that Abyssal never proc (actually it can proc if none of the 5 MKBs proc but this is very rare : 0.25(1-0.35)^5 =3%)

this means that if you have both items in real game (1 MKB and 1 abyssal) and if abyssal is acquired after MKB, then you lose 35% of the abyssal bashes.

the same is true for Abyssal overriding MKB if you have aquired MKB after abyssal, you loses 25% of the MKB bashes

you can always change the items priority by droping an item.

(I have posted this 2 years ago and I just saw that this is still not fixed so maybe it's intended but then I also found that MKB fully works with void troll bashes and both can proc in the same attack so why not fully stack also with abyssal)~|bug
List of Pangolier bugs|self.DotA2|~These are all the bugs I found in the last 2 days on Pangolier.

If you know about more, post them here.

##**Pangolier**

---
---
## Swashbuckle
---
#1. De-selecting Swashbuckle also gives Pangolier a move order

Normally, when you deselect a spell with a right-click, it does just that and nothing else. But if you deselect Swashbuckle while the targeting vector is active, the right-click also sends Pangolier a move order on top of deselecting the spell.

**Repro:**

1. Select Swashbuckle
2. Select a target point for the cast
3. Before letting the mouse key go, right-click to deselect and cancel the spell

**Result:** The right-click deselects it as expected. But it also sends Pangolier a move order.

**Expected:** The right-click should only cancel the spell if you do not have the "[Move After Ability Target Cancelled] (https://i.imgur.com/IQmTLVa.png)" option turned on.

(throwing this in here, the Scan ability has the same issue)

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2biXSdzSY9E)

---

#2. Swashbuckle's vector targeting doesn't behave like a ground-targeted spell.

For this, you need to have Quick Cast and "Quick Cast on Key Down" turned on. With this setting, you have to press two keys to cast Swashbuckle. Press the spell hotkey to target a point, and then press left mouse button to determine the vector direction.

However, if you left-click to target the direction of the spell, it behaves as if you have no spell selected. This means if there is a unit under your cursor, you select that unit and deselect your hero.

Sounds complicated? Just compare it to e.g. Magnus' Shockwave. Imagine whenever you cast Shockwave onto an enemy, the enemy gets selected because it was under your mouse cursor. Would be annoying, right? This is what currently happens with the vector targeting of Swashbuckle.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBDPb7ZBCDA)

---

#3. Swashbuckle's targeting vector indicator doesn't disappear when selecting other spell during it

When you are about to cast Swashbuckle, selected the targeted point, but did not release the mouse button yet, and then select another spell before letting the key go, Swashbuckle gets deselected, but the targeting vector stays. It stays until you select the spell again.

Even worse, when doing this, the targeted point does not reset either. If you want to cast, he will use the previously selected point as the start location.

Even worse, when done with Rubick, the vector can get permanently stuck on the ground. For this to happen, you have to lose the spell after doing the above steps.

**Repro:**

1. Select Swashbuckle
2. Left-click to select a target point, but do not let the button go
3. While holding the mouse button, select any other targeted spell

**Result:** The targeting vector gets stuck.

**Expected:** The vector disappears. And the target point variable resets (so that the next attempted cast doesn't go to the previously canceled location)

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7LCtzHNc-o)

---

#4. Swashbuckle works with Splash Damage (Rubick Swashbuckle + Elder Dragon Form)

Swashbuckle does not work with Cleave, for the same reason why Boundless Strike doesn't: it would deal tons of damage, due to how cleave works

However, Splash fully works with it. When Rubick casts Swashbuckle during Elder Dragon Form, he deals tons of damage if he hits more than one enemy

**Repro:**

1. Steal and cast Elder Dragon Form
2. Steal Swashbuckle and cast it so that you hit many units

**Result:** EDF's Splash activates on each hit enemy on each hit.

**Expected:** Swashbuckle should not trigger splash.

#5. Recasting Swashbuckle before the previous cast finishes messes the previous cast's attack location

Your typical multi-spell instance bug.

When you cast Swashbuckle (more like, give cast order) a second time during an ongoing cast, the ongoing cast's damage/attacks are applied where you targeted the new cast.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Swashbuckle
2. During the dash, give the cast order again, targeting a new spot

**Result:** After the dash, the old cast releases the attacks where you targeted the new cast. This is global, you can target it anywhere and the attacks will go there.

**Expected:** Obvious, the new cast should not override the target point of the previous cast.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2TAaZX_PgI)

---

#6. Swashbuckle does a 5th attack during the dash, hitting some enemies he dashes over

Swashbuckle does 5 attacks, instead of the listed 4. The first attack happens towards the end of the dash, behind the targeted area. The 4 others happen where they are supposed to happen.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Swashbuckle so that you dash over some enemies

**Result:** The enemy you dash over gets hit by an attack. This attack is not part of the 4 attacks after the dash.

**Expected:** No attacks happen during the dash. Or if this is intended, add it to the description of the ability.

##Shield Crash
---
#1. Shield Crash completely ignores ethereal units

This is one of the weirdest things currently. Shield Crash, a regular magical damage AoE spell with a self-buff, does not affect ethereal enemies. It neither even attempts to damage, nor does it count ethereal units for the self-buff.

It should not ignore ethereal units.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMIQp71FyD4)

---

#2. Shield Crash gets canceled when getting dispelled during the jump

When you get dispelled during the jump of Shield Crash, the jump gets completely canceled. This makes no sense. Dispels aren't supposed to cancel spells.

The shield_crash_jump modifier should not be dispellable (except by death).

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS1vuZrMttY)

---
##Heartpiercer
---
#1. Heartpiercer works against armor reductions as well

This is the most nonsense part about this ability.

Heartpiercer sets the target's armor to 0, regardless of anything. This means, if the target has *negative armor*, Heartpiercer will set it to 0, completely working against stuff like Desolator, Assault Cuirass, SF aura, Solar Crest, etc. Heartpiercer basically *grants* the enemy armor in this case.

I want to throw in here that Elder Titan's Natural Order and the Ancient Prowler Shaman's Desecrate (aoe slam) have this issue as well.

---

#2. Heartpiercer does not change bonus armor value in the HUD (UI bug)

Heartpierce completely negates *ALL* your armor. This includes your base armor, armor gained by agility, and any other green bonus armor you have. But in the HUD, only your main armor (base armor + agi bonus) gets set to 0. The green bonus value is not changed, giving the wrong impression that bonus armor works against Heartpiercer, which it does not.

[Here you can see] (https://i.imgur.com/OrSTVfS.png) a Sven with and without Heartpiercer debuff. With the debuff, his HUD shows 0+10, implying that the 10 armor are still working during it. [Here you can see] (https://i.imgur.com/8zgDH3S.png) Slardar using a level 1 Slithereen Crush against that same Sven. Once before Heartpiercer and once after. You can see that the second cast did full 75 damage, so the 10 bonus armor are negated by Heartpiercer as well.

The HUD should reflect this. The green + armor should not be there during Heartpiercer.

---

#3. Heartpiercer doesn't change the armor value of non-heroes (UI bug)

Similar to before, but this time for non-hero units. Heartpiercer *does* negate their armor as well, but the armor value in the HUD is completely unchanged.

[Here you can see] (https://i.imgur.com/jpP71mN.png) a Centaur Khan showing 4 armor, despite the Heartpiercer debuff.

##Rolling Thunder
---
#1. Rolling Thunder doesn't end when getting Assimilated/entering a Snowball

When you get Assimilated by an allied Lifestealer during Rolling Thunder, you still apply the AoE knockback/damage to nearby enemies. Slark can just walk up to people and you perma-stun them with Rolling Thunder from within Lifestealer.

Similarly, Snowball doesn't end Rolling Thunder either. When entering Snowball, you still apply the AoE effect on from inside the Snowball on enemies the Snowball rolls over.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Rolling Thunder
2. While rolling, have an allied Lifestealer cast Assimilate on you, or enter an allied Snowball

**Result:** You continue hitting enemeis with Rolling Thunder from within Lifestealer/The snowball

**Expected:** Rolling Thunder should end upon entering Lifestealer/Snowballs

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEdCR9efBjk)

---

#2. Rolling Thunder doesn't dispel Pounce and Deafening Blast's disarm

Pounce and Deafening Blast's disarm are undispellable, except by spell immunity. BKB, Blade Fury, Rage, Life Break and Repel, all can dispel both of them. But Rolling Thunder, also granting spell immunity and dispelling Pangolier, cannot dispel Pounce and Deafening Blast's disarm.

It should be able to dispel both of them as well.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_WcOe4yavw)

---

#3. Rolling Thunder's animation doesn't end when the spell does

When the spell ends, the animation of it continues/restarts. Pangolier curls himself up in a ball and floats in the air until given a new order.

[Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssMrA9s8Lag)

---

#4. Rubick uses Pangolier's voices during Rolling Thunder

When colliding with a cliff, some voice lines of Pangolier play. This voice lines are currently not coded as responses, but rather as sound effects of the spell. This means when Rubick casts it, he uses Pangolier's voice when bumping into walls.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pL0qV0c6B8)

---

#5. Rubick's Rolling Thunder model is rotated by 90 and is inside the ground

Rubick's Rolling Thunder model faces the wrong duration and is halfway inside the ground.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHovICr_oko)

---

#6. Rolling Thunder does not get canceled by some spell immunity piercing stuns

The following spells stun their targets even through spell immunity, but yet are unable to stop Rolling Thunder:

1. Flaming Lasso
2. Dismember
3. ~~~~Meat Hook~~~~ forgot this one, Meat Hook's stun doesn't pierce spell immunity
4. Walrus Kick
5. Black Hole
6. Chronosphere
7. Greater Bash
8. Primal Roar knockback
9. Toss throw

All of these should end Rolling Thunder, since it is supposed to stop when stunned during it.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4LXf9xOFzU)

---

#7. Rolling Thunder bounces off of Sprout trees, instead of destroying them

Rolling Thunder is supposed to plow through trees and destroy them. But yet, Sprout trees are not destroyed when hitting them from inside the tree ring, but are destroyed when hit from outside the ring.

Phoenix and Brewmaster can't gain Assist Gold while using their Ultimates.|self.DotA2|~On the current version of Dota 2, Phoenix and Brewmaster aren't able to gain Assist Gold from hero kills that happens while they are using their ultimates.

This means that when they use their ultimates at the climax of teamfights, they won't be able to get any gold except from heroes / units they kill.

Because of that, their item growth potential over the game is severely hindered even if they do well in the game.
Phoenix is even a hero with lots of Damage over Time skills, so the chance of Phoenix getting last hit on heroes during her ultimate is very low.

They also can't gain Urn of Shadows charges while they are using their ultimates and Urn of Shadows is a great item on them, who are able to gank / kill early game and are strength heroes.

Since Valve wants to fix their game, can we talk about one of the biggest game breaking bugs in the game that has been in since 6.84? Yes, 6.84.|self.DotA2|~Okay guys, hear me out. The hero that is most affected is my beloved techies. I know, I know, but don't destroy me just yet.
Valve has killed this hero. It is almost inarguably the worst hero in the game right now, and through strange nerfs and just leaving the hero alone since the nerfs, techies is in a real bad spot.

That's fine, honestly, with me. If valve wants his landmines to be gold factories for supports, and his remote mines to not scale in dmg with int like all other spells, that's okay too. Leave techies in the trench.

There is a bug however that affects his gameplay and cannot be intentional. Since 6.84, a LONG time ago, they added WK aghs and it ruins techies' game. When techies' mines kill a hero who respawns as a green ghost due to WK aghs, when they really die it will count as a suicide and not a kill for techies.

This means if techies gets a rampage on a team with a WK with aghs, it will be a 5 man suicide. If valve wants to make his abilties shit and make him very very difficult to play, that's okay. If valve wants to make reports count more, so people who instinct report techies players, I can't stop that and neither can they, so that's fine too. 

But please. Don't let them get killed by this bug anymore. Those three little bastards are the most lovable trio in doto, and I hate to see them hit even harder by a bug SINCE 6.84!

Thank you for your time, and if you made it here, cheers friend.

"What did you guys do with your break?"
"Uh, I think I was dead"
"Oh"

TL, DR: Techies mine kills on heroes who respawn with WK aghs will count as suicides, not kills. Has been broken since WK aghs added in 6.84.~|bug

Razor and His $80+ Genuine Golden Severing Crest Glitched Since Reborn - Devs Don't Care|self.DotA2|~reddit,

I've been playing Razor exclusively [since 2013](https://yasp.co/players/16558517/matches) and have over 2,000 games with him, so naturally, unpatched bugs related to the hero tend to bother me more than others.
I've been documenting and posting these bugs on the dev forums for years and nothing has changed.


I purchased a Genuine Golden Severing Crest a little over a year ago.

Since reborn, people on the enemy team have been claiming my Golden Severing Crest isn't golden.
Instead, some people only see the item as a regular blue Severing Crest.

Today I was able confirm the glitch.

Moo was streaming today, and thanks to lucky matchmaking, I got to play Razor against him (while wearing my Golden Severing Crest).
When I watched the Twitch replay, guess what I saw?: https://www.twitch.tv/moodota2/v/85487881?t=02h19m43s


This is bullshit considering **the price and rarity of the item is based solely on the missing golden effect**.


Also, am I the only one who notices the new glitchy flurry of electric effects all around Razor's chest since TI6?

Recently, Valve fixed the midlane-pull abuse with spells like Boulder Smash. The fix, however, created a new problem regarding auto-attacks|self.DotA2|~Recently, the devs fixed some cases where spells could be abused to knock neutrals towards the Dire mid lane in order to pull the lane ([here one example] (https://np.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5yue19/earth_spirit_full_midwave_pull_on_dire/)). They did this by making the spells place the "*modifier_disable_aggro*" modifier on the pushed neutral creep. This modifier causes the creep to be completely ignored by auto-attacks.

**The problem is, this modifier does not only work against lane creeps. It also causes player-controlled units to be unable to auto-attack the creep.**

What this means is, any nearby allied player-controlled unit using auto-attack will fully ignore that creep. This even includes attack-move orders. To attack that creep, the ally must directly target the unit with an attack order. This can be a significant issue when fighting Roshan, since he is a neutral creep as well. If you e.g. cast Telekinesis on Roshan, allies using auto-attack will stop attacking Roshan, and have to be given a direct attack order from their controlling players, which can cost several seconds

Spells using this modifier and therefore causing auto-attack issues are:

1. Earth  Spirit - Boulder Smash
2. Rubick - Telekinesis
3. Pudge - Meat Hook
4. Morphling - Adaptive Strike
5. Clockwerk - Power Cogs
6. Chaos Knight - Reality Rift
7. E: forgot to mention Tiny - Toss

**[In this video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W931F3BpcNU)**, you can see how Telekinesis makes the Chaos Knight and Rubick stop attacking Roshan for several seconds (6 seconds, the duration of the modifier), and alter in the video, the same in the neutral creep camp. Reality Rift and the spells listed above cause the same effect.

##**The best way to fix this would be to make that modifier only affect non-player units, so that it only makes lane creeps/towers ignore the pushed creeps, and not player-controlled units.**~|bug

#1. Several spells prevent units from auto-attacking the spell target for several seconds

Recently, some cases where spells could be abused to knock neutrals towards the Dire mid lane in order to pull the lane got fixed. It was done by making the spells place the "*modifier_disable_aggro*" modifier on the pushed neutral creep. This modifier causes the creep to be completely ignored by auto-attacks.

The problem is, this modifier does not only work against lane creeps. It also causes player-controlled units to be unable to auto-attack the creep. This means your and allied units can no longer auto-attack the target, which is bad.

**Affected spells are:**

1. Chaos Knight - Reality Rift
2. Clockwerk - Power Cogs
3. Earth Spirit - Boulder Smash
4. Morphling - Adaptive Strike
5. Pudge - Meat Hook
6. Rubick - Telekinesis
7. Tiny - Toss

**Repro:**

1. Cast one of the named spells on a neutral creep
2. Let auto-attack try to do its work

**Result:** Auto-attack does not target that creep for some time.

**Expected:** The disable aggro effect used by these spells should not affect player-controlled unit.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4UkreJlbr8)

---

#2. Phantasm malfunctions when getting Aghanim's Scepter during cast time

When you acquire Aghanim's Scepter during the cast time of Phantasm, the spell goes on cooldown and expends mana, but does nothing at all besides that. It gets completely wasted.

**Repro:**

1. Start casting Phantasm
2. Acquire Aghanim's Scepter during the cast time

**Result:** Phantasm does nothing but expend mana and go on cooldown.

**Expected:** When aghs is required, the spell should still do what it is supposed to. When no target is given, it should default to the caster, instead of doing nothing.

**Note:** Weaver's Time Lapse has this bug as well. Eclipse, Supernova and Enchant Totem work fine.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG2KRm2kbi8)

---

#3. Phantasm, Mirror Image and Manta Style illusion formatting issue

Illusions are always spawned using the same pattern:

* First illusion: To the east of the unit
* Second illusion: To the north of the unit
* Third illusion: To the west of the unit
* Fourth illusion: To the south of the unit

This goes for *every* illusion that spawns.

On top of this, Phantasm, Mirror Image and Manta Style also shuffle the units' position. This shuffling, however, has an issue currently. It happens in between the illusion spawns. This means, depending on when the main hero gets shuffled, some illus spawn based on the caster's original location, while the remaining illus spawn based on the caster's new location. This breaks the formation.

**Repro:**

1. Just cast a level 3 Phantasm, or Mirror Image several times and observe the formations.

**Result:** Depending on when CK is positioned, the formation can either be fine or broken.

Let's use CK as an example, level 4 Phantasm and always spawning 4 illusions. This are the possible results:

* CK gets positioned as first, then the 4 illus spawn. [Result] (https://i.imgur.com/0P3YOzf.png).
* An illusion spawns first, then CK gets positioned, then the remaining three illusions spawn. [Possible results] (https://i.imgur.com/tv8Ig6d.jpg).
* Two illusions spawn first, then CK gets positioned, then the remaining two illusions spawn. [Possible results] (https://i.imgur.com/AqNjXWL.jpg).
* Three illusion spawns first, then CK gets positioned, then the remaining one illusion spawns. [Possible results] (https://i.imgur.com/6XojmSR.jpg).
* All four illusions spawns first, then CK gets positioned. [Possible results] (https://i.imgur.com/fBSy12L.jpg).

**Expected:** The positions should always be based on CK's original position, and not change in between the spawnings.

Alternatively, ditch the formatting and make it completely random positions within a radius around the cast locaton. Chaos all the way.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKHteDHndXk)

---

#4. Reality Rift doesn't reliably make CK and the target face each other

Reality Rift is supposed to make Chaos Knight and the target face each other. This feature is even mentioned in the ability. However, currently, the target most of the time immediately turns away to face wher it was facing before. Chaos Knight and his illusions do this as well, if the target cannot be attacked.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Reality Rift on an ethereal enemy
2. Observe Chaos Knight's (and his illus') facing direction

**Result:** Chaos Knight faces the target, but then automatically and immediately returns to his previos facing direction. Same for his illus. The target also turns away, back to where it was facing before (happens if its last order was not a stop or hold command, the ethereal part doesnt matter here).

**Expected:** Reality Rift makes Chaos Knight and the target face each other (and make CK's illus face the target), and keep it that way until CK or the target are given an order which requires them to turn. Units should not automatically turn back to their original direction when forced to turn a different direction by a spell.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55sC5-_WwVg)

---

#5. Reality Rift's armor reduction does not update on refresh

When recasting Reality Rift on the target, only the duration gets refreshed. The armor reduction value does not update.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Reality Rift on a target
2. Level up the ability
3. Re-cast it on the same target, before the previous cast expires

**Result:** The debuff duration is refreshed, but the armor reduction is not updated.

**Expected:** The armor reduction should update to current level on refresh.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BSPIBKp050)

---

#6. Using Phantasm on Phantasm illusions creates illusions with 1 HP

Usually, when the Phantasm target dies during the split time, the spell gets canceled. This is the intended behavior. However, this does not happen when targeting Phantasm illus.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Phantasm on a unit
2. Cast Phantasm again, but on an illusion of the previous cast

**Result:** After the split time, the previous illus get killed off and then 1 HP illusions spawn.

**Expected:** Since recasting Phanasm kills the previous illus, it should cancel the Phantasm cast. Better yet, it should not be able to target Phantasm illus.

Alternatively, choose the inconsistent way and make it spawn the illus with the targeted illu's hp before it gets destroyed.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU-DQUEXkuQ)

## Suggestions
---

#1. Give Phantasm illusions a red skin, instead of using default blue

Phantasm illusions look exactly like e.g. Manta Style or Illu Rune illusions, despite being like 10 times more powerful than them. Also, having them all the same color is not user friendly in general. Units with different traits should look differently. Chaos Knight's illusions are not the same as Manta illusions, so they shouldn't look alike.

**Note:** The color would still be allied-only. This would make no difference for enemies, since they see the illusions like the original hero. This would only be a QoL change for the player and their allies.

[Here is an example of a red illusion] (https://i.imgur.com/GCIk8ZO.jpg)

---

#2. Give Reality Rift's debuff its unique effect, instead of copying Medallion

Reality Rift's debuff currently uses the same particle effects on the target as Medallion of Courage does. Not only is this unfitting to his color theme, it can also cause confusion, since it looks exactly like medallion's effect.

A simple recolor of the medallion effect would already suffice here. A new effect altogether would be better though.

[Here is an in-game example of an effect] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhT6UgISYkk)

## Visual glitches
---

#1. Chaos Bolt's stun duration display over the target is inaccurate

Chaos Bolt shows the stun duration it randomed above the target, along with the random damage. This display is currently inaccurate, because it rounds the value to the next integer.

For example, if stuns for 2.5 seconds, it will show 3 above the target, 0.5 more than it did. When rolling 2.4 seconds, it will show 2 above the target, 0.4 less than it did.

It should show at least 1 decimal, or even 2. When stunning for 3.64 seconds, it should show 3.6 or 3.64, and not 4.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEhsVp4Q0hc)

---

#2. Reality Rift particles play on allied illus when having shared control

When casting Reality Rift, it creates the particle effect and plays the sound on *every illusion Chaos Knight has control over*. This includes allies who have shared control enabled.

The particles and sound should only play on illusions owned by Chaos Knight, since it can only pull those.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1hSFcvEjg)

---

#3. Several heroes have no teleport animation

Most heroes have a teleport animation. They were added over the years during the beta, but suddenly got stopped being added. From the 114 current heroes, 81 have a teleport animation and 33 don't. Chaos Knight is one of them.

The following heroes I already made posts for have this issue as well: Abaddon, Brewmaster and Bristleback

For a full list of affected heroes, [see here] (http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=284692).

Every hero should have a tp animation.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqB-BRb10sE)

---

#4. Reality Rift's cast animation & sound don't cancel upon canceling cast

When canceling a spell cast, the animations usually reset to the idle animation and if it has a pre-cast sound effect, that sound fades off quickly.

However, Reality Rift does neither of these. The cast animation always gets fully finished, even when the spell gets canceled. Its sound always completely finishes as well, instead of fading off. Only the particle effects get canceled properly.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-38Y4GJQ6oc)

---

#5. Rare idle animation plays during injured phase

While injured, Chaos Knight should not use his rare idle animation, since it clashes with his injured idle animation. He has 1 rare idle animation which can currently play while injured.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mup7XIE8zWE)

---

#6. Spawn animation has 9 empty frames at the beginning

The first 9 frames of Chaos Knight's spawn animation are completely identical, so that CK is basically frozen at the beginning of the animation. They should be removed.


[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW3ugJxVT54)

---

#7. Chaos Bolt has an unnecessary screen shake effect on the projectile

Chaos Bolt currently has a screen shake effect attached to the endcap effect of the projectile. This screen shake is only applied to the targeted player.

Why is this redundant? Because the fact that you get stunned already causes your screen to shake. The projectile's screen shake is a second shake on top of that.

Why should it be removed? Because currently, if you avoid the projectile's effects by e.g. turning spell immune, invulnerable or hidden before impact, or by blocking it with Linken's Sphere, your screen will shake anyway, which makes no sense since you avoided it.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYh_P8fKaSY)

---

#8. Reality Rift doesn't make CK's illusion play the cast animation

When casting Reality Rift, all illus of Chaos Knight within 1375 range are pulled along with Chaos Knight. However, the illusions do not play the Reality Rift animation. They just stand still and wait to get teleported.

## Cosmetic item issues
---

#1. Chaos Hound Set's item pieces are not marked as set pieces

The pieces are not marked as set pieces, but are wrongly marked as bundle items.

[Here you can see a comparison to a properly set item set] (https://i.imgur.com/R21tvv4.jpg)

---

#2. The mount of the Chaos Hound set makes hoof sounds, despite being a hound

Chaos Knight has one mount which is not a horse: It's a hound. But it still uses the default movement sounds of Chaos Knight, which are hoof sounds. The hound should use different footstep sounds.

When looking through the currently in-game footstep sounds, I think Mirana's sounds fit the most to the hound. The foley sounds should stay the same (since the armor and stuff are still there), only the footstep sounds would need replacing.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6xIyahHSKQ)

---

#3. Blade of Burning Turmoil & Cudgel of Baleful Reign use default particle

The weapons of the Arms of Burning Turmoil and the Charge of Baleful Reign sets use Chaos Knight's default weapon particle effect.

The effect does not fit those items. It should be disabled for these two. Other custom weapons on which the effect doesn't fit already have it disabled.

[Image showing how the particles are out of place] (https://i.imgur.com/AMGPq2M.jpg)

---

#4. Several custom weapons don't use the default particle effects 

There are some custom weapons of Chaos Knight which were designed so that the default weapon particle effect still fits them.

These items have designated holes on the weapon where the particle effect is supposed to be. But the particle effect is missing on them. This goes for the following items:

1. Blade of Chaos Incarnate
2. Hellfire Edge

Furthermore, the following items, although not having a designated spot, are built so that the default particle effect still fits them well

1. Blade of Discord
2. Infernal Shredder
3. Waraxe of Lost Light

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-AVUXRYgpU)

[Image showing how the particles fit perfectly] (https://i.imgur.com/daKfN9l.jpg)

---

#6. Lots of Chaos Knight's cosmetic items are missing backfaces

A lot of Chaos Knight's cosmetic items are missing backfaces. Most of them are from the sets.

Note: Yes, backfaces are left out intentionally for not-visible places. This report is spots visible in the hero loadout, and via the default camera angle.*

The following items are missing backfaces

**1. [His default set] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XS67pOEzhjQ):** Mount, shoulders and pants

**2. [Arms of Burning Turmoil] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQt0MWbOmn0) set:** Mount and shoulders

**3. [Chaos Legion] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX0YwiDQS8A) set:** Mount and shoulders (cape)

**4. [Charge of the Baleful Reign] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhMBCvyDLQE) set:** Mount, helmet and shoulders

**5. [Embers of Endless Havoc] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zE8Y-Z5fsM) set:** Mount and shoulders

**6. [Rising Chaos] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s8KTznp4tY) set:** Mount, weapon and shoulders

**7. [The Hounds of Chaos] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O35bsXhmFs0) set:** Shoulders

**8. [Catastrophe] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQfcctnsepI)** mount

**9. [Atramentos the Apocalyptic] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ0mpF9yb9I)** mount

**10. [Chaos Knight's Armlet of Mordiggian] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUmGNvCvfUc)** off-heand item

Several changes that weren't mentioned in 7.07 or 7.07b patch notes|self.DotA2|~**EDIT:** Several things were fixed and as such, confirmed to be bugs. This also implies that Bane and Lone Druid nerfs were intentional and not bugs.

**EDIT 2:** Lone Druid transformation time got fixed as well.

**EDIT 3:** Valve fixed most of the tooltip bugs.

*****

Several undocumented changes were made in patches 7.07 and 7.07b. Some of them maybe be accidental bugs, but no way to know for sure if they were intended or not.

**Items**

* ~~~~Meteor Hammer still does 60/115 DPS, when it was supposed to be nerfed to 50/90 (building/units)~~~~
* ~~~~Necronomicon 1: Manacost reduced from 50 to 0 (Levels 2 and 3 still have 50 manacost)~~~~

**Heroes**

* Bane: Enfeeble can no longer target creeps
* ~~~~Lone Druid: Druid Form transformation time increased from 0.8 to 1.933~~~~
* ~~~~Tinker: Heat-Seeking Missile damage rescaled from 125/200/275/350 to 120/200/280/360~~~~
* ~~~~Venomancer: Movespeed was reduced by 15, from 285 to 270. Of this 5 was for being agility hero and another 5 was mentioned in the patch notes, meaning his move speed got reduced by extra 5 without mention~~~~

**Creeps**

* Centaur Courser (small) move speed reduced from 350 to 320
* Satyr Banisher (small) move speed reduced from 330 to 300
* Satyr Banisher (small) attack range reduced from 300 to 280
* Satyr Banisher (small) acquisition range reduced from 300 to 280
* Satyr Mindstealer (medium) acquisition range reduced from 500 to 300
* Satyr Tormenter (big) acquisition range reduced from 500 to 300
* Hill Troll (small) attack range reduced from 350 to 250
* Hill Troll (small) acquisition range reduced from 300 to 250
* Dark Troll Summoner (big) movespeed reduced from 320 to 300
* Dark Troll Summoner (big) attack range reduced from 350 to 250
* Dark Troll Summoner (big) acquisition range reduced from 300 to 250

These creep changes might be from the aggro and pulling changes, but they were not mentioned nonetheless.

In addition, several tooltips with talents and scaling cast ranges are lacking. This is some of them, but I probably missed even more cases.

**Tooltips**

* ~~~~Alchemist: Chemical Rage BAT with talent doesn't update, since it is mistakenly tied to bonus hp regen internally~~~~
* ~~~~Broodmother: Spin Web positive buff is missing % for move speed~~~~
* ~~~~Dazzle: Shadow Poison cast range scales with levels, but this isn't mentioned anywhere even after the rework~~~~
* ~~~~Dazzle: Shadow Poison move speed slow is missing %~~~~
* ~~~~Drow Ranger: Gust silence duration with talent recently got fixed, but the tooltip updating part is still tied to her old silence skill~~~~
* ~~~~Invoker: Tornado with lift time talent doesn't update~~~~
* ~~~~Keeper of the Light: Mana Leak cast range tooltip still says 550/700/850/1000 instead of 400/500/600/700~~~~
* Magnus: Reverse Polarity stun duration with talent doesn't update
* ~~~~Morphling: Attribute Shift bonus agility/strength was buffed from 3/4/5/6 to 4/5/6/7 but tooltip wasn't updated~~~~
* ~~~~Oracle: Fate's Edict cast range scales with levels, but this isn't mentioned anywhere~~~~
* ~~~~Phoenix: Launch Fire Spirit sub-ability duration is 16 instead of 20~~~~
* Phoenix: Launch Fire Spirit sub-ability damage with talent doesn't update
* Warlock: Fatal Bonds damage with talent doesn't update
* ~~~~Warlock: Shadow Word cast range scales with levels, but this isn't mentioned anywhere~~~~~|bug

##Bugs

#1. Flaming Lasso break range isn't based on the distance between Bat & target

Flaming Lasso's break distance is based on how far Batrider moved in an instance. So even if you blink towards your lasso target, the lasso breaks. Vice versa, you can do short blinks away from the target without breaking it, instantly pulling it over a short distance.

**Current behavior:** Lasso breaks when Batrider instantly moves 425+ range into any direction.

**Expected behavior:** Lasso breaks when distance between Batrider and Lasso target gets greater than 425.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWheLB3bMdY)

---

#2. Flaming Lasso breaks when target gets insta-moved, regardless of distance

When the target gets affected by any sort of instant movement (TPs, but also stuff like reality rift, x mark & glimpse), the lasso breaks, regardless of how far the spell moved it. So even a 0 range glimpse breaks the lasso.

**Current behavior:** Teleporting the target breaks the lasso, regardless of distance.

**Expected behavior:** Teleporting the target 425 range away from Batrider breaks the lasso. 0 range teleports or teleporting closer to Bat doesn't break the lasso.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqL3mxJOimA)

---

#3. Flaming Lasso gets canceled by Dismember & Walrus Kick

Dismember fully cancels Flaming Lasso on cast. Walrus Kick also cancels it, unlike other sources of forced movement.

**Current behavior:** Casting Dismember or Walrus Kick on a lassoed unit breaks the lasso

**Expected behavior:** Neither Dismember nor Walrus Kick should break the lasso. Lasso should have priority.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwJE4apcnnU)

---

#4. Flaming Lasso causes Geomagnetic Grip to stop working until the target dies

Geomagnetic Grip stops working on a unit completely when cast on it once while lassoed.

**Current behavior:** Geomagnetic Grip's buff gets stuck when cast on lassoed targets, preventing future grip casts from affecting the unit.

**Expected behavior:** The buff should instantly disappear when the target can't be moved.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiuVhSPG4M)

---

#5. Flaming Lasso interaction with Chronosphere

Based on cast order, Flaming Lasso causes Chronosphere to malfunction on lassoed units. It works fine with Chronosphere affects the target first, but not when Lasso affects it first. The bug allows the target to use insta-cast spells like BKB or Refraction in between the disables.

**Current behavior:** When lasso is cast first, Chronosphere fails to apply its debuff, so that once the lasso expires the target can cast spells before Chronosphere finally freezes it.

**Expected behavior:** Regardless of cast order, Chronosphere should freeze the target (it still should not cancel the lasso though).

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ93BNFoSa0)

---

#6. Aghs' secondary lasso doesn't break when the primary lasso gets dispelled

The secondary aghs lasso is supposed to break when the primary target is freed. This currently does not work when dispelling the first lasso. It does work when the target is freed in other ways.

**Current behavior:** Dispelling the lasso from the primary target does not end the secondary lasso.

**Expected behavior:** Dispelling the lasso from the primary target should also end the secondary lasso.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYmDXeqk370)

---

#7. Flaming Lasso disarm ends when first lasso cast ends, instead of last cast

When lassoing multiple enemies, the disarm timing is off. The disarm disappears when the first lasso expires or gets dispelled, instead of lasting until all lassoes coming from Batrider end

**Current behavior:** Lasso self-disarm lasts until first lasso ends.

**Expected behavior:** Lasso self-disarm stays until all lassoes coming from Batrider end.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reyi3J0RCHQ)

---

#8. Upgraded Flaming Lasso stops dealing damage when refreshed on targets

Flaming Lasso refreshes itself when recast on the same unit. However, the aghs damage does not get refreshed and stops based on the first cast.

**Current behavior:** Recasting lasso on the same target doesn't refresh the damage.

**Expected behavior:** The damage should refreshed on recast as well.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRWiXz-YudM)

---

#9. Flamebreak is always off-set by 25 range, based on Bat's position

Flamebreak does not exactly hit the area you target. Instead, it's off set by a small amount. That small amount is big enough to fit an entire hero in between though.

**Current behavior:** Flamebreak is off set by 25 range forwards, hitting 25 range further but missing 25 range between bat and the target area.

**Expected behavior:** Flamebreak's explosion should be perfectly centered on the targeted point.

If this is difficult to understand, [this image should explain it well enough] (http://i.imgur.com/1yRow6x.png).

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYUHFXpBaOQ)

---

#10. Recasting Flamebreak causes previous cast to explode at the wrong place

When recasting Flamebreak before the first cast finishes, the new cast interferes with the first cast and messes it up.

**Current behavior:** Recasting Flamebreak makes the previous cast explode where the new projectile is, instead of where it was targeted.

**Expected behavior:** Each cast should be completely independent and not mess up the locations of the previous casts.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmno5Uy9n-c)

---

#11. Sticky Napalm not working for Bat when first stack wasn't placed by him

Sticky Napalm only works for whoever put the first stack on a target.

**Current behavior:** When a Batrider Morph Hybrid places the first Sticky Napalm stack, Batrider cannot trigger Sticky Napalm, regardless of how many stacks he adds to the target.

**Expected behavior:** Every hero who contributed to the stack should be able to trigger it. Alternatively, the Sticky Napalm debuff should update to the latest caster.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV40r2qIPEc)

---

#12. Flaming Lasso can be cast on Roshan, without affecting him

Roshan is immune to any form of forced movement, so Flaming Lasso does nothing against him.

**Current behavior:** Flaming Lasso can target Roshan, doing nothing, wasting mana and cooldown.

**Expected behavior:** Flaming Lasso cannot target Roshan.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhmtpwawAJ0)

---

#13. Multiple lassoes from different sources on the same target behave badly

Flaming Lasso doesn't update when second hero casts lasso on an already lassoed unit. What it does is, it disarms the new caster and refreshes the already existing lasso. The target is still bound to the first caster. Meanwhile, the disarm on the first caster expires normally and isn't refreshed. So what we have is a unit still lassoed to the first caster, the first caster no longer disarm and the second caster disarmed.

**Expected behavior:** Multiple options:

* The lasso should update to the new caster so that the target is now bound to the new caster instead.
* The new caster should not be disarmed, but the first caster should get the disarm on them refreshed. The unit stays bound to the first caster still.

In the video you can see how this scenario is possible in a regular game. It requires Anti-Mage with Scepter and Rubick.

#14. Rubick instantly loses Firefly's flying vision upon losing the spell

When Rubick has Firefly active, he gains the flying vision normally. But as soon as he loses the spell, he also loses the flying vision. All other aspects of the cast still work normally.

**Current behavior:** On spell loss, the active Firefly instance still works normally, *except* for the flying vision, which gets lost. If you re-steal the spell while the instance still runs, you regain the flying vision.

**Expected behavior:** The flying vision should be bound to the buff/modifier, not to the ability itself. Just like how all other aspects of the effect are bound to the modifier.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ctpqk_ASvt8)

#15. Firefly does not grant flying vision to heroes other than Batrider

Firefly itself seems to not provide flying vision. It's more like an "activator" of flying vision. Batrider and Rubick are the only heroes capable of having flying vision, so the activator only works here. Any other hero does not gain flying vision with Firefly

**Current behavior:** Firefly's flying vision only works for Batrider and Rubick.

**Expected behavior:** Its flying vision should work for whoever casts the spell and stay until the buff disappears.

Game breaking "Item is not allowed for this hero" bug|self.DotA2|~About 30 minutes into my pheonix game the game decided [I was banned from the item shop](http://imgur.com/hx9wAao), this applied to all items in the fountain, secret shops and with the courier.

[This](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dota_2_Workshop_Tools/Panorama/Javascript/API#CPanoramaScript_SteamUGC) functions in Panorama API allows make manipulations with any Steam Workshop items for any game. Anyone can make click bate custom game with few simple lines of code and set like/dislike, subscribe/unsubscribe, add to favorites/remove from favorites for any item in workshop such a skin for csgo or guide for PUBG. I think its wrong and this functions should be fixed.

Dire offlane creeps split up at the tier 1 tower. Can we give this some attention so it gets fixed?|self.DotA2|~I guess you call this a bug. It's been happening since 7.02 and still isn't fixed. When you're trying to block as a Dire offlaner, the creeps will want to split up when they get to the tier 1 tower. 1-2 creeps will want to go left of the tower, and the rest want to go to the right of it. So you can't block the wave from that point on.

I know people have posted about this here, but I haven't seen those thread get too much attention or get to the front page of the sub. We've got the Kiev Major coming up shortly, and this does affect things in a small way. Let's see if we can highlight this issue so it can get fixed soon!~|bug

Warning: Courier destroys bought item|self.DotA2|~Test footage: https://youtu.be/HfLQ32ePUP8  

Match ID it actually happened during the game: 1756185468

Time: 40:55 buying BKB and TRYING to deliver it. (Hero - Lina)

What I found out:

works when wards (obs and sentr) are separated.

Wards have to lie on the ground.

Wards have to be different types - Observer and sentry.

Wards have to lie on the spot in the video (where courier returns?)

When courier delivers your bought item, he randomly picks up wards (1-4 above) and destroys the item (orchid, bkb, refresher). 


What actually Valve wants to teach us: if you started the game as a support, STAY POOR AND BE A F****** SUPPORT.

Significant Time Dilation bug in NaVi vs VG.R|self.DotA2|~EDIT: This is game 1 of the grand finals.

At approximately 53:56 game time, VG.R were pushing mid highground when YANG on Beastmaster (with a Refresher) has around 15 secs until Primal Roar comes off cooldown. Void hits him with Time Dilation, bringing and freezing the roar cd to 27 secs.  Beastmaster refreshes, roars Dendi (his roar goes on the ~~70s cooldown as a result). When Time Dilation expires, the roar magically comes back to the 15 sec cooldown it had before being affected by Time Dilation, effectively cutting the roar cooldown by ~~55 secs. Pretty gamebreaking, but they still lost the game.~|bug

##Bugs

#1. Auras don't automatically prioritize the highest level source when multiple are nearby

When there are multiple sources of the same aura nearby, the game does not automatically prioritize the highest level of them.

For example, if an allied Beastmaster with level 1 aura picks up an illusion rune, then sends the illusion to an ally, and then levels up his aura to 2, and then moves to the ally as well. The ally will still be affected by the level 1 aura, since the illusion was there first. The stronger level 2 aura of Beastmaster is ignored. Even worse, even after the illusion died, the aura buff will stay on level 1. In order for the ally to be affected by the level 2 aura, they first have to fully lose the buff, and then re-gain it.

This is even worse for heroes with global auras. Here is a scenario that can cause CM's aura to not update for some allies until they actually die.

**Repro:**

1. Allied CM has level 1 Arcane Aura, you are affected by it
2. Allied CM picks up an illusion rune
3. Allied CM dies, the aura buff is now kept up by the illusions
4. While dead, CM levels up aura to level 2
5. Before the illusions expire, CM respawns
6. The illusions expire and disappear

**Result:** Once CM respawns and the illusions die afterwards, you still are affected by the level 1 buff. The buff will not update to level 2, even though CM's aura is on level 2.

**Expected:** Auras should *immediately* prioritize the stronger aura. If 2 units with the same aura get close to you, and one of them is on a higher level, the higher level should instantly override the lower level aura.

#2. Scepter upgraded Freezing Field applies level 0 Frostbites

Freezing Field's Scepter upgrade still applies Frostbite's mini-stun after 2.5 seconds even if there aren't any points placed into Frostbite.

Even funnier, when choosing the +1.5s Frostbite duration talent, it applies a 1.5s duration Frostbite together with the mini-stun. Since Frostbite is on level 0, this mini-frostbite deals no damage.

**Repro:**

1. Level up Freezing Field (keep Frostbite at 0)
2. Purchase Aghanim's Scepter
3. (optional) choose the +1.5s Frostbite talent
4. Cast Freezing Field with an enemy in range and wait 2.5 seconds.
5. (optional) Have the enemy cast a disruptable spell

**Result:** After 2.5 seconds, Freezing Field mini-stuns the enemy, interrupting them. If the +1.5s talent is chosen, a 1.5s Frostbite is applied, which deals no damage.

**Expected:** Since Frostbite is not leveled, it should not be applied at all. A spell not learned should not be castable under any condition.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhdcyMV2wIY)

---

#3. Scepter upgraded Freezing Field Frostbites use hero duration on creeps

The Frostbites applied by Freezing Field always use the hero duration, despite the Frostbite spell having a creep duration for non-ancient creeps.

**Repro:**

1. Have 2 tanky non-ancient creeps nearby
2. Cast Frostbite on one of them
3. Immediately start channeling Freezing Field so that only the other creep gets hit
4. Cancel Freezing Field as soon as the 2nd creep gets frostbitten

**Result:** The frostbite applied by Freezing Field expires first, despite it being applied at least ~~3 seconds after the manually cast Frostbite. Freezing Field used the hero duration on the creep.

**Expected:** Freezing Field should use the creep duration (10 seconds, 11.5 with talent) on non-ancient creeps, just like how a manually cast Frostbite does.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAjOe4DqQXg)

#4. Freezing Field does 99 explosions, instead of 100

This one was fixed once before already (quite some time ago), but got broken again.

Freezing Field is supposed to do 100 icy explosions. It currently does 99. [Even the ability description says 100 explosions] (https://i.imgur.com/aFf6F6C.png).

10s duration divided by 0.1s interval is 100 shards.

**Repro:**

1. Cast Freezing Field and count the shards (tip: Use host_timescale)

**Result:** 99 explosions are spawned.

**Expected:** 100 explosions should be spawned.

## Suggestions
---

#1. Bring some consistency in how interrupting root abilities interrupt enemies 

There are 16 rooting abilities in Dota 2, from which 6 interrupt their targets.

These 6 use 3 different methods of interrupting.

1. Searing Chains, Nature's Guise, Overgrowth, Entangling Claws: These force a stop command on the unit (as if they pressed S to stop).
2. Ensnare (Naga Siren) and Ensnare (Dark Troll Summoner): These force only the channeling to stop, without affecting anything else.
3. Frostbite: Technically, Frostbite's root does not interrupt at all. Instead, the ability applies the stun modifier.


So this is how they behave against certain orders.

* Group 1: Channeling spells completely interrupted, any other order completely canceled, shift-queues cleared.
* Group 2: Only channeling interrupted, but hero continues with channeling animation (which delays shift-queued orders). Does not interfere with any of the unit's actions.
* Group 3: Channeling spells completely interrupted, any other order interrupted, but unit automatically restarts them, since stuns do not clear unit orders.


This is some unnecessary inconsistency. It would be better if all interrupting roots would do it in the same way. In my opinion, the 1st option is the most straight forward and most clean, while the 3rd option is the worst. The second option would be fine, too, but it needs that one bug fixed where the channel animation does not get canceled.

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bpSTjmYY6c)

---

#2. Make Freezing Field use a slow aura, instead of spamming a slow debuff 

Currently, Freezing Field simply spams its slow debuff in 0.1 second intervals on everyone within the slow radius.

Since the slow is centered on CM and independent from the icy explosions, it would make more sense to use an aura here instead. It would effectively make no difference but make it look cleaner.

Differences this change would make

1. Status debuff no longer constantly flashes due to periodic refreshing of the modifier
2. It can no longer be dispelled (dispelling it currently is pointless anyway, since it gets re-applied very quickly)
3. Status resistance would reduce slow value, instead of slow duration (duration reduction is pointless for the same reason as above)
4. Slow applies instantly on each server tick, instead of every 0.1 seconds.

Everything else would stay the exact same

[Video demo] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT8A8SAoG9g)

Or alternatively, make the icy explosions apply the slow instead, would make more sense logic-wise. But this would be quite the nerf for the ability.

## Tooltip stuff
---

**Crystal Nova:**

* Added new ALT note about the 900 radius 6 seconds ground vision

**Frostbite:**

* Reworded description to use proper terms (root&disarm)
* Fixed description saying it lasts longer on creeps on level 6 or lower (level of creep doesn't matter)
* Reworded ALT note about disabling blinks
* Added new ALT note about the True Sight
* Added new ALT note about the interrupting
* Removed total damage values from traits (since they can't be made to consider talent bonuses)
* Fixed the duration talent bonus not being added to the creep duration in the description

**Arcane Aura:**

* Slightly reworded description to fit general style more
* Removed second note, which is now completely irrelevant since the regen mechanic changes
* Slightly adapted the first note for the same reason
* Added note to the manacost/manaloss reduction talent to make it clear that it is added to Arcane Aura, and is not a separate aura

**Freezing Field:**

* Reworded description to be more accurate regarding how the slow is applied
* Added explosion spawn radius to traits
* Added Scepter Frostbite delay to the traits

Bot matches are completely ruined.|self.DotA2|~So I sometimes play a bot match or two for the very relaxing environment (no flaming each other, except Morty Bot, I always flame Morty Bot).

There are several things that are broken after 7.00:

* Bots get stuck before the horn. When playing Radiant, bots get stuck between the Large camp and Medium camp in the jungle near the mid lane. 
* Bots can get stuck trying to place a ward. I'm assuming that they check for valid ward position and that there's not already a ward there. Some ward locations seems to return errors, which makes the bot stuck, for instance the ward spot behind "old Roshan", near the Dire secret shop. 
* Bots do not understand Monkey King (at all). If they see him jump onto a tree, they will swarm to that position and stand right next to that tree forever, or until they see Monkey King somewhere else. 
* Bots do not understand Tinker March of the Machines (this is not a new bug, they didn't understand it before 7.00 either). Even unfair bots do not respond to standing inside march until their health reaches a threshold where they start running back towards base. *There are probably several heroes that can be added to the "bots do not understand this hero's ability"-list.*
* Bots start "Roaming to gank X" almost always when X is below a certain health threshold, and thus run way out of position to kill that enemy. 
* Bots do not understand bounty runes, and will only pick them up if they "stumble across it" (which is almost never). 
* Bots never use Shrines. Ever. (At least after the 20-30 hours I've spent playing with bots). 
* Bots do not understand that the "real rune" can only spawn in one location, and can get stuck trying to pick up a rune that is not there. If they, for instance, run top at 3:58 to get the rune at 4:00 and the rune spawns at the other location, the bot will usually stand around waiting (because it receives a "negative" on the "bottle filled" check I assume). 
* ~~~~Before the patch, bots always upgraded the courier at 3:00 (or approximately around that timing)~~~~ (EDIT: I realize I was wrong here, but it's still the same bug now) . Now they don't do it. 
* More courier bugs: The bots can end up using the courier to "stand around". I noticed a bot playing Pudge having the courier standing around him for no reason, and even proceeded to grab the courier to stand by him again for no reason when I was using it. 
* Even more courier bugs: Bots use the courier for every small item around 1-2 minutes into the game, which they didn't do before the 7.00 patch. In a way this resembles the life of a mid-laner in a real match as well, so not sure if this is a bug or "intended feature".
* Bots don't understand backpacks and will keep late game items in the backpack rather than switch out for other items. 
* Bots don't understand illusions and will use preventive items if approached by them. 
* Bots try to build old recipes for items (such as drum of endurance).
* Bots do not skill talent tree
* If a bot has a full inventory and wants to pick up an item which cannot be placed in backpack (Aegis, Rapier, Gem), they will just stand there looking longingly at the item until you kill them or snatch the item.
* If you buy a courier in the picking phase, your team will end up with (at least) two (non-functional) couriers.

I'm sure there are several more bugs that I haven't remembered from the top of my head. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong or add to the list (I can keep updating if there are others who are playing versus bots from now and then and have more bugs to this list). 

Edit: Formatting

Edit2: Some additional bullet points. Also want to mention to sceptics: Yes, I agree that there are pressing matters to focus on in the "actual game", but there are a bunch of us who enjoy bot matches from time to time, and it is also a great way for new players to try the game without "ruining games in pubs". 

Edit3: Realized one bullet point needed strikethrough since several people pointed out it was a bug before 7.00 as well. Bug is still there, so it still stands as a bug on the list. Added a bullet point.

dire offlane creep path is broken, you cant block creeps properly anymore since defense of the league of storm patch, the creeps go completely crazy 9 out of 10 times once they reach t1 tower and blocking is pretty much impossible. it works on radiant just fine so it gives them a pretty huge advantage on offlane and may or may not be another tiny %wr for radiant. danke herr eidechse~|bug

"Can't change replicated ConVar sv_cheats from console of client, only server operator can change its value"  

That did not happen a week ago. And I have no idea, how to bypass this.~|bug
