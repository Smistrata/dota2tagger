Update from the Shanghai Major|self.DotA2|~Two things:

1) James.  We've had issues with James at previous events.  Some Valve people lobbied to bring him back for Shanghai, feeling that he deserved another chance.  That was a mistake.  James is an ass, and we won't be working with him again.

2) As long as we're firing people, we are also firing the production company that we've been working with on the Shanghai Major.  They will be replaced, and we hope to get this turned around before the main event.

As always, I can be reached at gaben@valvesoftware.com.

Disqualified from TI6 open qualifiers due to error by the coordinators of the event, faceit.com|self.DotA2|~Extremely frustrated with faceit.com (website coordinating the open qualifiers for TI6)

tl;dr My team was disqualified from the open qualifiers of TI6 because the admins started our second game while we were still in our first, and wouldn't allow us back into the first round of the open qualifiers.

My team (MFG__) competed in the The International 2016 open qualifier Americas #1.  In the lobby for our first match, the opposing team failed to join in time to play the match, and it was therefore ended.  However, our team was not awarded the win.  After contacting the admins, *FACEIT Sue* joined our lobby and restarted the match.  So we played our match and won.

However, after our match was complete we found out on faceit they started our second match while we were still playing the first one.  Since we were in the middle of our first game, we couldn't join the lobby for the second one and the admins disqualified us, allowing the other team to advance.

We voiced our complaints with *FACEIT Sue* who told us we were out of luck and eliminated from the tournament.  After continuing to argue our case, she redirected us to *FACEIT_Mikey* to hear our concerns.  But the only way to talk with someone directly through their website is the friend them.  I have friended *FACEIT_Mikey* but as of this time he has not accepted.

Inside the match rooms the conversations between my team and the admin can be viewed
Me: Uctok
Teammate: foreverdaed

First match room: [https://www.faceit.com/en/dota2/room/b1225f4c-05e0-4e49-bd73-a41989c5e845](https://www.faceit.com/en/dota2/room/b1225f4c-05e0-4e49-bd73-a41989c5e845)

Second match room: [https://www.faceit.com/en/dota2/room/51d3a832-dbdc-4f7e-9d57-c422badbb6f5](https://www.faceit.com/en/dota2/room/51d3a832-dbdc-4f7e-9d57-c422badbb6f5)


Yes, we could still participate in the second round of open qualifiers, but my team arranged their schedules to play at this time and are unavailable for the second round of qualifiers



**Update:** foreverdaed was able to contact [/u/Faceit_Mikey](https://www.reddit.com/u/Faceit_Mikey) through faceit's chat client today.  I can't link to that chat window, but if you believe me here's their conversation: [http://textuploader.com/53hk5](http://textuploader.com/53hk5)

While he apologizes that this happened to us, he defends and reiterates it wasn't there fault.  From his and [kidovate's excellent response](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4p8qf5/disqualified_from_ti6_open_qualifiers_due_to/d4j28bt) I believe they are in part true - why did Valve choose to still do their patching during what is likely the busiest days and busiest times they will have all year?  And why did they not coordinate their patch/API changes with Faceit, who Valve must have known would surely be impacted by it?

I hope Faceit, Valve, or both take the next step and admit this ruined the open qualifiers not just for my team, but reading through these comments and Faceit_Mickey's comments, other teams as well.  I hope they try to do something to compensate or show their sincerity.  Yes faceit is working on improving their system so this type of scenario doesn't happen again, but that doesn't fix the fact that my team was unfairly left out of fully participating and enjoying TI6.~|complaint esports

Bring 2GD back|self.DotA2|~Bring your support here guys, we all know that Valve keeps an eye out on reddit. 

The return of James was a great addition to the first Shanghai Major, even when it was going to shit with the stream cuts, audio problems and so forth. Bring him back, he did a great job, even with so much downtime. 


UPDATE 1: [@follow2GD](https://twitter.com/follow2GD/status/703133163590017024?lang=en)

2016-02-26 08:23 UTC

> Regarding the Reddit thread comments, it was valves decision. before the event, I was told to be myself. :(

UPDATE 2: [@follow2GD](https://twitter.com/follow2GD/status/703247410181464064?lang=en)

2016-02-26 16:00 UTC

>Going to sleep on it (statement). It's a very very odd situation. more than meets the eye you could say.

For users from /r/all:

James "2GD" Harding is a dota 2(ARTS video game) panel host who mediates a panel of dota 2 experts in discussing the games that have happened/ will happen soon as well as the teams who will be playing the games. Think soccer round-table host, talking about the soccer match before and after. 

He's known for being unconventionally entertaining (with British banter, swearing etc.), and Valve has told James [to "be himself" for the event](https://twitter.com/follow2GD/status/703133163590017024?lang=en). 

The working theory right now is that he apparently stepped on too many toes, extending one of his segments for too long and got released as a result. There has been no official statement regarding the situation yet, but the reality is that James is no longer hosting the panel, having been replaced by Jorien "Sheever" van der Heijden, the other host at the event.

There's more backlash as a result of very vocal negative community feedback about the tournament's production, which has resulted in the broadcast stream cutting twice today, audio issues as well as timing issues. This is evident in the stream over at www.twitch.tv/dotamajor, which is, at 8:42 SGT, still spamming "Bring back James" memes.

Help Bring Back the Noob Stream for TI7|self.DotA2|~Video with more detailed points: https://youtu.be/IuG0a5WZeek
 
The Noob Stream for TI7 is something that will take very little resources to create, but can make a big difference in the long run. The last thing we want is stunted growth in a game we all hold dear to our hearts. Personally, I feel the benefits far outweigh any negatives, but that is for you all to judge. My hope with this video/post is that it will help create more of a movement to get the Noob stream back to TI, because currently I dont believe its going to happen.
 
A lot of people have come to me in the past few years and told me the Noob stream is what got them into Dota, which is amazing to hear. I know that Purge has said hes not too interested in doing this stream, which makes sense with his super successful Weather-Man segment, but there are still plenty of other people passionate about bringing new players into the game such as myself.
 
**What is the Noob Stream?**
 
Started at TI4 - Valve wanted to cater towards new players
Stream was well received. Casters were Pyrion, Shane & Blitz, as well as Purge & myself
 
**Why should you care about this?**
 
* Dota notoriously has the biggest barrier to entry for any esport
* The health of the game relies on two entities - 1) Competitive & 2) Casual
      * The competitive scene is the primary focus (new changes to majors/minors). This keeps the game relevant
      * The casual scene is often times taken for granted, but is needed for continued growth
* Also a lot of older players stopped playing after 7.00 (too overwhelmed with changes)
* The International is the tournament that EVERYONE will watch, so catering to newer players is a good thing
 
**Why bring it back?**
 
* Cost effective & not many resources needed
* Gives work to dedicated personalities that do not get invited to the main stream
* Brings brand new players in
* Brings back old players that lost interest because of major changes (SHRINES LUL)
* Formula for success already exists, with minor tweaks
 
**What worked in the past?**
 
* 1 constant stream
* Duos or Trios that work well together (cant be random people).
* Balance in educational & light heartedness (dont want to be too dry)
* Advertising the Noob stream on the main stream & promoting it on dota2.com & other media
 
**What didnt work?**
 
* Intermittent Stream
* Felt stale at times (very repetitive)
 
**Pros & Cons**
 
Aside from things already stated:
Pros: Very low maintenence & cost. Requires a room in the arena with computers/internet
 
Cons: Low viewer count in past & costs money to pay people
**Note: I feel as if the low viewer count is more of a perceived con as opposed to a legitimate one. This stream isnt made to get a ton of viewers, but even with a 3-5k concurrent viewership, you are bound to reach over 100,000 uniques throughout the entirety of TI. This cannot be underestimated.**
 
**My Vision**
 
The most basic setup would require 1 stream, with 2 sets of rotating casters (6 total people) on a couch with 1 webcam.
 
2 people cast the game, while the third is the sideline reporter (gets live questions from chat, puts relevant information on screen such as common lingo)
Example: http://i.imgur.com/mGciFni.jpg
 
Have LIVE lineups appear below stream that people can check out at any time in order to learn more about those specific heroes
Example: http://i.imgur.com/L1Wbmxb.jpg
 
Have videos premade that we can show during the game to go over hero skills
Example: http://i.imgur.com/P3OvCt5.jpg
 
Have videos premade that explain basic concepts such as laning as well as the entire point of the game. These videos will be available below the stream at all times and can be referenced during the game. This avoids repetitive talking points.
Example: http://i.imgur.com/rWyz2ic.jpg
 
Thanks for watching/reading. This obviously does not cater to a lot of you, but it certainly does for a very important group that can help our game find continued growth. Ease of access is everything & remember that TI is a time where everyone will be tuning in. Id love to hear more suggestions from you all on how to make this experience less overwhelming for new players, because that should be the goal.

Thank You|self.DotA2|~Just wanted to write a small bit expressing my gratitude to everyone especially Valve for letting me participate in the main stage of this years TI.

The last two years have been a bit of a slump for me in terms of casting and overall mentality, I appreciate those of you who stuck with me through it to get me here.

Casting with Owen is always fantastic and being on the panel with people like Winter and Black is enlightening to say the least.  I feel hungry to improve and hopefully be back again next year!

Feel free to leave any criticisms if you like, today I'm just happy to be a part of this community.

Edit: To the guy who asked for my new twitter its @DraskylDotaTwo and yes, I know it's a terrible name 3:

* Here is our interaction with admins, where you can clearly see we were promptly ready after our previous game. We finished our games, and followed the procedure (As is documented in the link)
http://dota2.starladder.tv/forum/categories/719/67078

* This is the tournament is question, as you can see, the finals were forfeited. We still have not recieved word as to why.  http://dota2.starladder.tv/tournament/8892

* Most of our games were casted by an official caster, who validated that we did not do anything badly mannered in our games. 

* As a rather new team, we were very happy to be able to play in the finals. It sucks to be let down that hard, and not even be given a reason from the admins as to why. Furthermore, the fact that we are the ones being punished for trying to contact the admins, as the others were not answering.

* We were told by an admin that the finals could not be decided by the decision of the admins, yet it was.

* The opposing team claims to have contacted us, but never did.

After months of planning, designing, building and tinkering, The Manila Major has reached its conclusion.

We've had 8 days filled with amazing moments. The close calls, incredible comebacks, flawless executions and flat out brawls showed us that Dota 2 is in a very good place right now.

We were fortunate enough to have an incredible crowd here in the Mall of Asia Arena, as well as some very vocal fans online that pointed out the things we could improve on.

Thank you Valve for trusting us to host an event worthy of your expectations. We had a blast here in Manila and we hope everyone enjoyed The Manila Major as much as we did making it.~|shout esports

Official announcement from the teams of Midas Mode|self.DotA2|~We, the participating Midas Mode organizations and players of Evil Geniuses, Immortals, Mid or Feed, Na`Vi, OG, OpTic Gaming, Team Liquid, and VGJ.Storm, have come together this holiday season to take a stand against the tyrannical Grinch going by the name SirActionSlacks. We reject his philosophy of greed, we reject his corrupting mentality of more, and we most definitely reject his lackluster memes! So we are hijacking his tournament for good.

[In all seriousness, we want to thank Slacks and MoonduckTV for being so willing and excited to help us hijack their tournament and its meaning for a bunch of good causes.]

In the spirit of the holidays, the players of all eight teams have pledged to donate all of their prize winnings from Midas Mode to a charity of their teams choice listed below.  We believe that giving back to our communities is a responsibility we all share in life, and we are inspired by other gaming communities who have long been supporting charity and uplifting others. Having the bright lights of Dota upon us, the time is long overdue that we as a Dota community come together to set an example. Gamers can be a positive force in our communities and this is one small step in the right direction.

We ask that all of our fans join with us and support these and many other great causes this holiday season. Please donate a bit of whatever you have to give to help lift someone else up: money, time, canned goods, or a beloved game gathering dust because you spend twelve hours a day grinding for badges now!

FACE-IT administration, you have fucked up big time. Shady admins in Ro32.|self.DotA2|~Hey there, participant of the open qualifiers with a 6k to 7k stack here (Team ftw- currently in round of 32) 

What just happened to me and my teammates has to be the most unfair thing that has happened to me ever. We were ready (all 5 of us) today to play our round of 32 game against "team agg", joined the lobby, waited for the whole 15 minutes to wait for their 5th player and he didn't show up, for those who don't know when this happens the lobby is closed and u get back into the match room on face-it website. We waited for an entire 50 mins sending messages to admins asking for live chats literally all we could do to solve this, all the answers we got were to wait for an admin join our match room and solve the problem, this never happened.

We waited for an hour and found out that some fucking shady admin resulted the game in favour of team agg when the game was not played and even if they had to result withouth playing the game they should have given us the win.

[PROOF PHOTO WITH CHAT NEXT TO THE MATCH ROOM](http://imgur.com/YDCfYHm)

We kept contacting the admins and they changed their speech by telling us that now that the game is resulted they couldnt do anything when they resulted the game 4HEAD.

Truth about IG.|self.DotA2|~(Posting for Ana since his post was removed)

Hi guys,

Everything you're about to read is the truth, and even though it probably won't help me I hope others learn from my mistake.I never wanted to post or bring this drama to the public but I have exhausted all possible channels of communication and I am at my wits end. 

I guess most of you don't know me since I'm not a top player, so I'll give a brief intro to my background. I'm a 16 year old Australian born Chinese/Viet mix who left the final year of high school to try play dota2 professionally and my family isn't exactly well off so my success in dota is very important. My friend & manager, Tian (CEO of gogosu.com, a Chinese dota2 coaching platform) helped me piece my thoughts and write this post. 

Proof its me.

http://imgur.com/a/E5WvS

Tian has been my friend even before I went to China, we used to play Aus pubs together a lot and when he understood my situation he recommended me to try pro dota2 for a year. With the help of Tian I left for China on 17th of Jan and stayed with hes family until end of March, during this period Tian used his connections in China and had vouched for me to trial at different clubs, EHOME.K, VG.R and IG. I was very new to pro dota and seriously sucked so I was beyond ecstatic that IG were interested in offering me a position.

Tian helped me read and alter a thick contract between IG, ACE and myself. Initially the contract was heavily favored toward IG and left very little protection to myself. IG could let go of me as they wished, didn't guarantee me prize money split, couldn't guarantee me play time and was a two year long contract. The offer was for me to play as IGV's main player, but that Ferrari430 may come back at some point and at that point I could either switch to the other IG roster or play as sub.

Because of this Tian made multiple adjustments to the proposed contract including but not limited to the following,

* I would have equal prize money with all 5 players in non valve events whether I was a main player or sub
* I would have equal prize money with 4 players (BBK, XXS, QD, Rong but excluding Ferrari430) in Valve events
* The contract would only last 1 year instead of 2
* That I would be guaranteed some play time in scrims and minor tournaments
* That I would be provided a teacher for Chinese and Math
That all my travel costs to renew my Chinese visa would be paid for

After many iterations back and forth IG finally agreed to these changes, however when we went to sign, none of the agreed upon changes made it into the final contract. I immediately contacted Zhili, IG's COO and he guaranteed that it was a clerical mistake and that everything IG promised will hold even though the contract had been changed. He said that it would be too late to reprint and to trust his word on it. My mother in Australia signed the contract for me as I am still underage.

Fast forward a few weeks, Ferrari430 was suddenly back and IGV renamed to IG and IG renamed to IGV, I was told I could play mid for IGV (Paparazzi's stack) or sub for Ferrari430. It was a very tough decision, but I chose to stay with IG because IG promised me that even though I was a sub I would still get equal share of prize money and IG also promised that it would be the final year for Ferrari430 and that he was definitely retiring after TI regardless of result. Had I known what was about to happen to me I would have never chose to be benched for 4 months as a sub. 

After returning to the team Ferrari430 played very well in the NEA online qualifiers and helped IG secure LAN final in Beijing and then abruptly left the team. I was subbed in last minute and played only in the LAN finals but luckily we were able to secure the victory over Newbee.

Fast forward a few months and a lot has happened or should I say not happened. Ferrari430 came back to train for TI qualifiers and again I was benched. During my entire stay at IG, no attempt at getting me a Chinese tutor or translator was ever made, I was excluded from most team meetings because according to the management I did not understand Chinese, I was never compensated for costs related to renewing my Chinese visa. Overall the management of the team was very poor and there was little communication between management and myself.

Fast forward to the beginning of post TI shuffle, management didn't proactively let me know whether they had a spot on the team for me and whether Ferrari430 would stay or leave. In the end Tian and I had to wrestle the truth out of them, they did not want me on the main or IGV roster but said that they would make a third team for me. This sounded like a poor attempt at benching me again for a season since no players other than myself were confirmed for IG's 3rd team. Guess what? Its October and IG does not have a third roster.

Their excuse was that I could not communicate with the team when in actual fact my mother is Shanghainese and that makes me half Chinese and I understand all the dota2 terminology, items, heroes, skills how to coordinate in fights, I was also willing to learn.  The truth of the situation is that they were already in talks with bigger name players and they had time left on my contract and didn't know what to do with me. When we asked them who was on this supposed 3rd team of IG or even what the name was no information could be provided to us.

There are a lot of rumors on the Chinese forums that I left IG because I could not speak Chinese or eat Chinese food. That is all false, I can understand enough Chinese for pro dota and I love Chinese food, but I also enjoy western food. Is that a crime? 

I really wanted to continue playing with my boys in IG but management didnt let me. This is when Tian started negotiating my release from IG because they didn't have any real plans of having a third team, as far as I know I was going to be benched for another season. I would rather go back to school if I could not find a good team and was a sub doing nothing again. 

I was finally paid my winnings from NEA late September and it was 51,200 RMB out of a grand total of 800,000 RMB and the rest of the players were paid over 100,000 RMB. I am also yet to be paid for my DPL (over $2000 USD)  or G-League winnings (over $2000 USD). 

When we contacted IG regarding the discrepancy between what I was paid and what was promised they made excuses and eventually cut contact with us. They simply don't acknowledge that they promised me equal share of prize money even when presented with proof, VK (IG CEO) even went as far as belittling my manager for wanting more than I got and that it was a joke that we were even talking to him for so little money because he is such an important man. In the end VK (CEO), Zhili (COO) have all stopped replying messages from Tian and myself and I am short over $12,000 USD.

I am deeply sad that such a world renowned club would be ruined by such poor management. How many players have been ripped off by IG or other shady clubs? Will Ferrari430 ever receive his Ferrari promised to him by IG? Are promises worth nothing unless written in the form of a contract? 

Here are the transcripts (In Chinese) between Tian and IG.Zhili (IG COO) The transcripts are basically Zhili promising us equal share of prize money and when confronted with his own chat history he ignores us.

Here are the transcripts (In Chinese) between Tian and IG.VK (IG CEO) The transcripts are VK belittling Tian and basically ignoring the evidence that the COO of IG promised us equal pay.

I don't see how I will ever get this 12k back and it is a lot of money for my family and I. I guess I am just really sad about this whole situation but I have learnt my lesson. Finally, I just want to make it clear that my beef is with IGs management and I have NOTHING against the players in IG, I made many friends there and I am grateful for that and still chat with them day to day. 

If on the off chance that Wang Sicong reads this post, please return to me what I am owed and stop letting bad management ruin IG.

Ana

**Comment from my manager: To those saying I should not have advised Ana to sign an altered contract. I recognise it was a risk however at that time it was a take it or leave it but if we take it IG promised us verbally the terms we wanted. It was still in Ana's best interest to take and sign the contract, as starting a career in a team was more important to Ana than money, this however does not take away from IG's wrong doing. Secondly according to Chinese law wechat chatlogs are absolutely admissible in event of contract dispute.**

SingSing interview: Announcing retirement from Dota|youtube.com||announce esports
How I think ti5 will end|self.DotA2|~ti5 finals. Evil Genius vs Team Secret; Game Five
	
Amazingly, Evil genius has managed to turn it around, and scrounge up two victories despite the first two games of the grand finals being devastating losses. Arteezys Max Backstab Riki build simply proved too strong for Evil Geniuses. Thankfully, while PPD was rushed to the medical tent to be treated for Salt poisoning Fear took his seat and banned it,  but to complicate things further, Ice Frog, hallow be his name, took Suma1ls advice from DACC at the start of the series, patching him out of reality, and into the game, where he became the new Storm Spirit. Fortuanatly, Gabe Newells son, Mason was on hand to take his place.
	
EG thought they might actually be able to beat Secret in the final game, as S4 didnt ban Suma1l Spirit, because he is cool. However, Secret finally breaks out their last pocket start, drafting Arteezy safelane farm techies. He builds midas first, followed by five more midases. Evil Geniuses were not expecting this, and are unable to counter it.Icefrog would later be quoted as saying 
	
Finally, after three long hours, the game finally enters the mid game. Evil Geniuses, on radiant has been pushed back into their fountain, their ancient is exposed, Secret could end the game at any time, instead, they choose to fountain camp, killing Evil Geniuses over and over again. Finally, they drag Fear out, kicking and screaming, and bring him to Arteezy.
	
Fears life support system has begun to fail irl, both of his arms have snapped, yet he somehow managed to escape his base and take Dires top lane tier one, the first tower they have lost all game. Secret pledges to make an example of him.Arteezy must deal the final blow, to prove his loyalty to Secret, who have just revealed they are sponsored by Isis and the Illuminati. 
	
Arteezy draws his midas, and prepares to deal the final blow, he fights back tears as he prepares to do what he knows he must. Artour Fear finally says. You were the last hope of NA dota. Then fear dies irl and in game. there is no respawn timer. The audience falls silent, everyone can clearly hear the maniacal laughter of Team Secret. Finally, after several minutes, Zai stops laughing long enough to ask Arteezy why he is crying. He was just some old man, he reminds him.			
	
No one is able to hear Arteezys response over the laughter. He wasnt just some old man. He was my father. The caliber of his sins are too much and as a final act of repentance, he screams SUICIDE SQUAD, ATTACK! and uses the bombs gifted to him by his sponsors to destroy himself, and take out the rest of his team.
	Sensing a chance to win, the Mason/Suma1l Archon blast out of their base, zip zopping all they way to Dires ancient, as techies mines were rigged to destroy every building on the map.
	
Then tragedy strikes. The same black magic Puppey and Kuroky used to kill NaVi has brought them back as undead abominations. Dendi throws a perfect hook at Suma1l Spirit, catching him just as he runs out of mana. 
	
The EG survivors yell to the audience, NA DOTA, LEND US YOUR STRENGTH but nothing happens because the NA dota scene is a joke. Finally though, a lone figure stands up in the crowd. Drinking one last Red Bull, Demon grows wings, and ascends to a higher plane of existence, becoming a being of pure energy, then sacrificing himself to give Suma1l a single bloodstone charge and just enough mana to escape and kill the xboct ghost, causing him to drop six rapiers. "Classic Jimmy." Say all three Merlinis. A single tear running down their collective faces.
	
With his final bit of mana, he rockets towards the dire ancient, but alas, he wasnt fast enough. Admiralbulldog destroys both ancients simultaneously, forever proving Rat Dota is best dota, winning the game for Alliance. The Aegis still goes to China for some reason.

Basically they acknowledged its well within legal right to stream the games on Twitch and yet they still disregard Valve's broadcasting policy and went ahead with the takedown

Orgs, if you're going to take down NoobFromUA at least give us a good official alternative.|self.DotA2|~There were hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Dota fans that relied on NoobFromUA to provide them with condensed highlight videos of games that they would never be able to watch. It was the perfect way for people like me, who aren't able to stay up the entire night on a weekday to watch 8 hours of Dota, for 5 nights a week.

And yeah, there are Twitch VOD's, but those still aren't condensed. A NoobFromUA vid shortened a BO3 series to 25 minutes or less, while still making it feel like you didn't miss anything. A lot of Dota 2 viewers just don't have the time to watch full VOD's of every single game played, but like to keep up with every single match.

My point is, just come out with something official for us to use. Maybe even hire NoobFromUA to make that content for you. IMO it doesn't even matter if I have to watch/see ads or whatever, as long as the content is still available, I think most people will be happy.



EDIT: People are letting me know that PGL has started uploading highlights to their youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/PGLeSport

However after watching last nights highlights, they dont seem nearly as good as NFUAs. Also this is only PGL, and doesnt solve the problem for other tournaments. Still think the best option is to officially involve NFUA, or (as people have also pointed out) do what Epicenter did and have NFUA run PGL ads before/after the vid.


EDITx2: Yes people, we know that what NFUA was doing was illegal. Yes he was stealing content. Yes he was going to get taken down eventually. Yes he was a thief. 

However thats not the point of this post. Whoever NFUA was doesnt matter, what matters is that the Dota community has lost its primary source of high-quality highlights, a service that many people depended on to watch Dota. Please use this post to discuss what should be done about this issue, and not to slam NFUA. Theres other posts in which you can do that. ~|suggest esports

Bot Tournament - Who'd be interested in a mini or large tournament to find the best coder(s) / bots?|self.DotA2|~Hey /r/DotA2 

After looking at the latest patch notes, [discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5hr1di/dota_bot_scripting_valve_dev_wiki/) and noticing this [tweet by Cyborgmatt](https://twitter.com/Cyborgmatt/status/808126889386799105). I was wondering if you'd be interested in watching or participating in a mini bot tournament.  When I used to play CS 1.6 on my t3000 internet and pentium 3 all I could play were bots in glorious 15 fps.  I'd like to create an incentive for coders who spend their time making these scripts for the bots in a tournament.  We'd probably start small with a few coders with top 3 can take the monetary prize we'll be offering. We'd like to host it sometime in the new year depending on development goes and a few other things as this is pretty new. We'll also put up the entire prize pool for the first tournament and find the casting.

Here's what we need from you:

1. If you're interested in participating with your script PM me

2. Spread word of this to those who might be interested

**tl;dr** 

1. Making a bot tournament. Need scripters / bot coders as participants.
2. We're putting up the entire prize pool to provide an incentive for coders
3. We're unsure yet on a date as we need to look closer into development / feasibility and hand out a rulebook.

Thanks as always!

**edit** Wow this blew up.  Sorry If I didn't get back to everyone. I think I PM'd 95% of you.  Join the discord for updates on the tournament. I'll make a follow up post shortly! https://discord.gg/5uHNzHt~|other esports
ESL: We were wrong.|self.DotA2|~I`ll get straight to the TL;DR here (and then add more details and context after it):

Over the last few days we were wrong in how we acted in multiple instances, and this post is to apologize to you, fans of esports and community streamers affected. 

We were wrong in how we kicked off streaming on Facebook and we were wrong in handling the follow-up with the community, the communication here and the DMCAs which we have since retracted.

The introduction of Facebook as our new broadcast platform did not go as it should have. Instead of focusing on ironing out the kinks, engaging in the right kind of dialogue with you and incorporating your legitimate feedback we were busy following protocol and defending our actions. We should have simply let the community streamers do their thing while focusing on getting our end right. Regardless of having or not having the right to do so, taking down streamers that provide a good experience while we arent is not the way to go about things.

We were in the wrong. We will learn from it and go forward.

Now, Im not going to try to defend it, but since the platform and streaming of the game is a topic which will resurface, I`ll try and add some details and context which are important to consider for the broader picture:

ESLs goal is to elevate esports. Its been that way for the past 18 years and many of the same people that started the company in 2000 are still the same ones working behind the scenes at ESL today. Were not in it for short-term profits but want to help build an industry. Helping to create esports is not only the core of our efforts, it is all we do. Our mission is to give players and teams a platform to create big moments that you enjoy, talk about and remember. 

Expanding the amount of streaming platforms which show and promote esports and building an environment where platforms compete to show esports is part of that process. Working with companies that can help us bring esports to the mainstream, is part of that process. Yet if the things we do come at the expense of our relationship with the audience, we need to critically re-evaluate our approach. 

We acknowledge our mistakes and we apologize.  What we got wrong last week we want to get right for the rest of the year.  That means learning from what happened, working with Facebook on improving the experience as well as changing the way we talk with you.

All things considered, thank you for watching ESL One Genting, whichever platform you did it on. I'll be here to continue collecting feedback as I have been for the last couple of days and trying to continue the dialogue. ~|news esports

Don't be sucked in by the latest PR statement|self.DotA2|~Edit 3: [Problem solved!](http://blog.dota2.com/2018/01/dotatv-streaming/)

The latest tweet and further "clarifications" from ESL are meaningless, because ESL HAVE NO RIGHTS TO THE DOTATV CONTENT in the first place, so they don't get to set the conditions for streamers. 

These clarifications are PR statements carefully crafted to give the idea that ESL get to decide which streams are acceptable, and therefore which ones they can take down. They may have achieved that so far, but only by abusing the law, not by right. 

Until Valve change their policy, any stream that only uses data from the client is fine, and we don't need pointers from ESL on who they will and will not allow to stream from the client. That's been the case for as long as I've played dota. The idea that ESL can "clarify" something that ISN'T EVEN THEIR POLICY is arrogant and condescending.

The idea that ESL is now "going easy" on streamers because they've realised the error of their ways is a fallacy. They had no rights to terminate non-commercial streams in the first place. However, their post is worded as if they're doing the community a favor by allowing streamers who are already allowed to stream in the first place. 

They're hoping their new attitude will make you forget something crucial: they chose to abuse the DMCA process to shut down streams that weren't breaking the rules.

Edit: In the [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7sw0w5/i_am_ulrich_schulze_here_to_answer_your_questions/) ESL are still stating "We create and produce the content of the tournament, we do have legal agreements with Valve for those tournaments, and we had streams taken down which violated a policy laid out and publicly communicated." Organisers have **never owned the rebroadcasting rights to the games**, only to the content they add. Many people watch their events because they add quality content and use quality platforms, but many people also just watch in DotaTV.

Until Valve tell us differently, streamers like Mike Le Phoenix were punished by a fraudulent use of the DMCA process. The discussion about Facebook and its problems is important, but don't forget that this company chose to break the law to stifle competition because they had a poor offering, and **still won't back down from their position**.

Edit 2: [Tweets like this](https://twitter.com/william_partin/status/956605040256528384) still display a fundamental misunderstanding of the current policy and of why the subreddit is outraged. This isn't about getting content for free, pirating, or being anti-capitalist: VALVE ALLOW RESTREAMS. Anyone commenting, from ESL to the general public, needs to pause for a second and understand that **the current, publicly published policy, from the official rights holder, allows free and open rebroadcasts from DotaTV at any time**. Any kind of journalist worth his salt would try to figure out why this is such a hot button issue that has caused so much outrage.

This man has done the virtual equivalent of putting his fingers in his ears and going "LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU" because he doesn't like the way things are being said. He comes across as very sensitive because he's tired of people being angry and raging. This is a vital discourse that will have ramifications on the game and its audience figures for years to come.

TLDR: If Valve want to change things so that orgs own the games, they can, but they don't right now, and ESL just doesn't get it.~|discussion esports
Hero Concept: Shang'Hai, the Major|self.DotA2|~*A malevolent entity born of a faraway land, it is said Shang'Hai was once one of three noble and respectable lords beneath the almighty King Ti. But the fortunes of these lords were cursed with Doom, and it was not long after Lord Frankfurt barely escaped the three tiered hell of Compendamonium with the aid of a golden ~~~~fleece~~~~ feather cloak that further demons paid visit to proud Shang'Hai. Deep within his smoggy castle, they whispered melancholy and woe into his ears until he could barely run his kingdom.*

*Even as his most trusted adviser Yames hurried to undo the damage of his decrees, Shang'Hai was seized by greater madness and had him slain most brutally. This loathsome act consigned his soul to oblivion, yet he still lurches forward, sharing his misery with the world at large.*

*Watching his brothers in arms fall one by one, Lord Manilla shuddered to think what the future may hold for him.*

&nbsp;

Shang'Hai is not an intelligence hero that fulfills a role that no other in the history of Dota has before. While other heroes bring slight amounts of embarrassment, generally in the early-to-mid balance patch, Shang'Hai is the first to apply large amounts of embarrassment globally. His abilities are well suited to indirect harassment and sowing confusion, however, this is as true for his allies as it is for his enemies. It is considered by many to be almost impossible for Shang'Hai to be handled well even by the most experienced of players, yet many still try.  

&nbsp;

**ABILITIES**
&nbsp;

**Q  Quality Equipment**

ShangHai randomly selects an item in the targets inventory. Until they return to fountain to collect another, the Major replaces it with an ancient barely-functional version, increasing the cooldown on any active it has, removing passive effects and halving stat bonuses. 

&nbsp;

**Cooldown:** 60/45/30/15

**Mana:** 100/110/120/130

&nbsp;

* hey, this doesnt match the list!*

&nbsp;

**W  Sounds and Silence**

Targeting a small area, all enemies within are haunted with demonic sounds and pew pew noises, fearing them away from the Major and dealing random magic damage. If cast below 5% maximum mana, Shanghais battery has run dry, causing both him and his targets to become silenced instead.

&nbsp;

**Damage range:** 1-322

**Silence Duration:** 2/3/4/5 

**Cooldown:** 10/9/8/7

**Mana:** 100

&nbsp;

*Rachu mantantu vespacha kaltamu Synderen!*

&nbsp;

**E  Fired**

Shang'Hai instantly denies an ally with less than 25% hp, causing all other allies in the area to frenzy for a time. Frenzied allies gain bonus damage and movespeed. So long as they can draw sight to the Major, the frenzy timer does not count down. 

&nbsp;

**Bonus Damage:** 30/50/70/90

**Movespeed:** 10%

**Base Duration:** A bit over a week 

**Cooldown:** 60/50/40/20

**Mana:** 100

&nbsp;

*You think you deserved another chance? You are mistaken. You were an ass, and I won't be working with you again.*

&nbsp;

**R  Delay**

The entire map is enveloped in an enormous wave of incompetence. All heroes and creeps are stunned periodically every few seconds over three hours.

&nbsp;

**Time between ~~~~Stream Dropouts~~~~ Stuns:** 5/4/1

**Cooldown:** 4

**Mana:** Enough that you just can't quite manage to go aghs/refresher anymore.

&nbsp;

*I shall not stop until my task is finis... wait, I guess I will stop after all*

&nbsp;

>Aghanim's Scepter can be purchased by ShangHai and causes Delay to last 6.5 hours instead of 3. Additionally, it grants a 25% chance for Quality Equipment to simply lose the opponents item completely instead of replacing it. 

&nbsp;

**EDIT:** I have added level scalings ~~~~because one guy wanted them~~~~ by popular demand. Also, thanks for the gold stranger, I've always wondered what it did and now I know it's pretty much a book of coupons. ~|comedy esports
Every player at TI5 should get paid.|self.DotA2|~At this stage, The International is not just a competition, but almost a celebration of the year in Dota. Teams and fans come from all around the world to watch the games, interact with the personalities, and make new friends.

That's why, I think that each player who makes it into TI, should be given an amount of money. That way, nobody walks away empty-handed. Even the earliest losers are still able to show something for their year of hard work.

And don't say that 'A Free Vacation To Seattle!' is their reward. That doesn't pay rent or buy food.

Imagine if each player, upon making it into TI, got ten thousand dollars. 10k.

50k a team. 16 teams. That is 800000. Eight Hundred-Thousand.
That barely brings the prize pool below 16 million.

Suddenly, nobody is a loser. Everyone is able to pocket something. Crashing out early is never good, but at least it isn't the end of a career, at least it doesn't mean you spent a year working and toiling for nothing.

Alot of these teams don't make big money. SEA scene, NA scene. Tier2ish teams. Ten Thousand can change alot for somebody.

I would love to see this. Let TI be more of a celebration then a cut-throat competition. The winners will still rake in millions, why not spread the wealth and help the Dota2 Esport community just a little bit.~|discuss esports

Valve Event advertising - THANKS GABE|self.DotA2|~First of all thank you Gabe. 
Thank you for keeping the advertising out of Valve sponsored events.  I know that must have been a hard decision.  In my mind I can see the decision polarize your team but my god it is THE BEST way to go. 

You have no idea how great it is to be able to watch TI6 without constant advertisements.  To be able to switch streams without twitch advertisements.  To be able to watch highlights on YouTube without watching a 30 second commercial. 

To not have to hear the casters say Purge what are the Monster Energy statistics on that game 

Thank you for not charging for this  for not making Valve events a Pay-Per-View | MAIN EVENT.  
And thank you for giving us hats to pay for the privilege of having an advertisement free event  wow.
You may not hear it enough from fans but this means the world to me.  Corporate sponsors distract and cheapen sporting events.  
Thank you Valve
Thank you Gabe

Open letter to Valve: do not work with PGL again|self.DotA2|~Hi everyone. Im one of the talents from the Russian-language commentating studio at large Valve tournaments, and this is an open letter to them and to PGL. I dont find it necessary to introduce myself, as most of the viewpoints and opinions expressed in this letter are in no way my personal ones, but rather collective. The central message of this letter can be summed up as follows: Valve, please, take action and deal with PGL.

Now to specific points. I think it will be reasonable to split this letter into several segments dedicated to each of the Majors. That will be the best approach.

The Manila Major

Last season, Valve was actively testing various contractors, apparently in order to find the optimal one for cooperation on a permanent basis. That was how ESL got Frankfurt, PW got Shanghai, and PGL got Manila. At the time, it was PGLs first Dota tournament; the tournaments theyd organized previously were in other disciplines, which was why we were a little worried here: firstly, on account of the long traveling distance, and secondly, because the organizers might not have an entirely clear idea of what Dota was, what made it different from other disciplines, and what product the viewers would like to see. However, our doubts were gone almost the minute we began cooperating with them.

First, we were told that our plane tickets to the event venue were business class. This was a real gift to us, as business class is significantly more pleasant than economy when your flight takes half a day. I suppose its fairly obvious. Thus we traveled comfortably to the venue, were accommodated at Manilas best hotel, were treated to food, drinks and themed events such as Oktoberfest (although that was perhaps a disputable choice, seeing as Oktoberfest coincided with the last night before the playoffsbut it was there nonetheless), an American cuisine night, a Chinese one, etc. etc.

The organization of the tournament itself was also top-notch, and we were more than satisfied. The absence of delays or lengthy pauses, or communication issues between talents and organizers, made for an unforgettable tournament, the best of the three Majors in the 2015/16 season. 

I dont think theres a point in describing PGLs work at TI, as most of the work there was done by Valve and MCW events, while PGLs resources were focused specifically on the English-language livestream. Everyone was OK with thatPGL, Valve, and ourselves. This looks like a very positive letter so far, doesnt it? Well, not really. Problems would begin later.

The Boston Major

Valve cut its Majors budget for the 2016/17 season. Thus while during the debut season, the contractors had been given a blank check and could ask for however much money they needed, this time the budgets were fixed. Nevertheless, they were more than enough to create a comfortable environment for everyone while also turning a profit. Not as large as in the previous season, but a decent one too. However, PGL decided it should make just as much money, and went into saving mode. This is where it gets interesting.

Firstly, business class flights were out of the question nowwhich was indeed clear to everyone by that point. Were no superstars whod complain about something like thatalthough granted, it was something of a letdown to go back to economy having tasted all the perks and comfort of business class. There were, however, other and more serious issues.

Besides slashing the budget, this year Valve decided to test a system where analysts would work from home. 

Essentially, the experiment disappointed no-one. Many analysts said it was nice to not have to travel to the other side of the world when you could stay at home. Jetlag and acclimating are after all difficult things that everyone experiences in their own way.

However, introducing this practice created the need for an assistant contractor to help PGL set up analyst panel for the Russian broadcast and establish communication between commentators and analysts, in Boston and Moscow/Kiev respectively. As many of you know, there were only two obvious options here: to entrust this task to either Starladder or RuHub. PGL made up its mind and announced a bidding procedure for an assistant contractor. Bids were written up and sent to Romanians for consideration.

I was in touch with RuHub staff at the time, and they were a little worried, as they wanted very much to organize an event of this kind, while realizing that the head of PGL is a good friend of the head of Starladder. Thus there were misgivings, and they eventually proved not unfounded.

A few weeks after the consideration (the reason for the quotes will become clear later), PGL wrote a letter to RuHub saying they had chosen Starladder as the contractor. 
During that time, Valve was deciding on a list of commentators, analysts, and the presenter who were to take part in the event. The list was made, and invitations were sent out to commentators. Sent out isnt perhaps the right term. MCW Events, who were in charge of travel, accommodation and other things related to commentators, asked them to fill in requests which could be used to book plane tickets, hotels, etc.

The personalities who were to be involved in the analyst panel received nothing. A few days after PGLs choice in favor of Starladder, a Starladder employee contacted Goblak, XBOCT, PGG, NS, and Faker, the folks Valve had decided to invite for covering the tournament. Each of them got a different wording. Some were addressed in an official style; with others, the format was Hiya, you are from Kiev arent you, so I suppose you wont need accommodation? To say those people were surprised would be an extreme understatement. For instance, Goblak, who wasnt an employee of either RuHub or Starladder, might have no idea what they were even talking about.

Everyone unanimously declined to participate. The following day, a group chat was set up on Skype with a certain Silvio, who was one of the top people at PGL (or the top person, Im not sure). The chat included all the people whod declined to participate, Silvio, and a Starladder employee. Silvio introduced himself, said that Starladder had been chosen as the contractor, and that the people were invited to work on December 211. Any questions? was the last sentence of that message. It sounded as if decisions had already been made and no-one had a choice. This is hardly how an official invitation to a tournament ought to look like. Over the course of the following hour, the same thing happened all over again: all the analysts and the presenter declined to participate. OK, Silvio wrote, and the conversation ended.

That same evening, it turned out Valve had been entirely out of the loop on the bidding prodecure and PGLs choice of Starladder. This is not to complain about Valve, who had after all handed over the organization of the tournament to other people. Nonetheless, the matter was investigated, as it was in no-ones best interest to leave viewers without analysis at an official livestream. In a conversation, RuHub found out that the bid had actually never existed. The bids had been a pure formality, and PGL had ALREADY handed over the organization of the analyst panel at the point when RuHub had only just sent their bid inStarladder hadnt even written theirs. The absurdity of the situation was at its peak.

Valves decision was to give the livestream to RuHub, which PGL had no choice but to accept. The viewers won out, as besides the invited analysts, it was now possible to get together a full-fledged analyst panel in Moscow. RuHub provided the money that was paid to the unofficial analysts. In total, RuHub took pretty much money out of its own pocket, even though setting up the Russian stream was initially supposed to be funded by PGL. With the amount theyd provided, however, if not a penny had been spent on RuHubs part, the analysts wouldve been sitting on stools in front of a coffee table with an old Soviet portable TV set to watch the matches on.

Speaking of money, PGL naturally decided to cut the salaries too. Compared to Manila, where everyone was paid what we can designate as 1.3k gold, the Boston salary was 1.0k gold for everyone, with no distinctions. Moreover, people would only find out how much they were paid upon checking their bank accounts a month after the tournament. Meaning that PGL didnt have a definitive notion of a salary in mind. Not as far as Russian talents were concerned, anyway. English speakers always engage in personal dialog with the organizers and negotiate their salaries themselves. For instance, the absolute top-tier commentators and analysts can earn 4k gold for a tournament; for talents in a league below them, the figure is 23k gold; and for the presenter, 56k. In a handful of cases, with the young and inexperienced, the organizers are able to pull off paying what they pay the Russian speakers. The organizers didnt want to discuss the issue of salaries with our representatives; they werent interested.

It was time for the tournament to begin. Out of the entire coverage staff, 6 commentators traveled to it at PGLs expense (Lex had been refused a visa), along with 3 or 4 tech people, and that was it. Whereas earlier, any organizer would provide the budget for a content maker and a cameraperson, this time, the suggestion was to bring them along at ones own expense, or not at all. Doesnt that sound like a good idea.

Upon arriving at the tournament, the commentators and players began to feel the austerity. You only get food if you work/play on that particular day is a really strange formula. And while an organization like EG might not particularly care who paid for their lunch, it could be a problem for teams without an organization or sponsor. Thankfully, the commentators did work every day, so they got food every day too. Its quality, however, left something to be desired. There were other small organizational nuisances, but they werent critical and its hard to remember most of them by now. 

The Kiev Major

You might think those were the juiciest and most interesting bits of this letter, but wait, theres more. Quite likely, if the Kiev tournament had gone well, this letter wouldnt have had to be written in the first place. This time, however, the organizers went even further. 

People started getting invitations to the tournament at the end of March. A new system was introduced. Besides the main invites, there was a list of backup commentators and analysts: those who would be invited if some of the core ones were for some reason unable to go to the tournament. People began to wonder what Valves selection principles even were.

There was information that Valve put a certain committee in charge of selecting people for large tournaments. Said committee consists of a certain number of people who assess the quality and working style of various personalities, and come up with a list of required invitations based on their own judgement. Here another question arises: who selected the committee members themselves, and on what basis? No names are provided, for no apparent reason. That is to say, there is of course one obvious reason, and thats to prevent any attempts at influencing these people to get them to pick personalities that would otherwise not have been invited. But there are two sides to this coin. A member of the committee may also be inherently biased against a specific person and be a factor in their absence from tournaments. 

In and of itself, putting a group of people together is a very good idea, since it immediately precludes any bribery on the part of competing organizations. However, in order that the group itself doesnt raise any questions, their identities ought to be disclosed and an explanation provided as to what merits and/or accomplishments earned these particular people the honor of assessing the work of talents. 

Another problem with the issuing of invites was their quantity. An odd number of commentators and an odd number of analysts made planning our work and schedules complicated. Im going to skip ahead here and show you an ordinary example: here we have 7 invited commentators (with 4 parallel livestreams during the group stage), and 5 analysts (so theres no sensible way to split them into shifts). What was the problem with inviting one more commentator and one more analyst? We never got an answer to that question. The funniest thing about it all was that the number of people invited to the home major was one-and-a-half times smaller than the number of talents at the English-language studio. And while that system hadnt raised too many questions before, this time the decision was quite baffling. 

But enough about invites already. They invited who they invited, even if it did cause a number of problems. After the invites were issued, discussions began between PGL and the Russian-language talents concerning payment and everything else. Shouldnt the very fact that an inviter doesnt bring a specific salary offer to the table, raise some eyebrows in 2017? It certainly raised ours.

v1lat was chosen to speak on behalf of the Russian-language talents, as there was no point in discussing it all individually. We were on friendly terms with each other and wanted to present a united front rather than be disparate voices. For the first few weeks, PGL was evasive, didnt name any sums and was generally trying to avoid clearly answering the remuneration question. Finally, they said everyone would have the same salary as in Boston (1,000 gold), regardless of their workload. In the meantime, the English-language talents were each discussing their salaries individually, and there was talk of the organizers paying certain personalities 500 gold per work day + 300 gold for flight days, adding up to about 4,000/5,000.

A situation like that suited pretty much no-one. Firstly, working in the hall is a bit of a different story from sitting back and just working for the internet. When you see people behind your back, when youre in the same room with them, you cant help feeling that much more nervous. 

Meanwhile, an option discussed with v1lat was for him to not be a commentator at the tournament at all, but instead, to be the presenter, interviewer, and interpreter for the official Russian livestream. The discussion got stuck as Vitaly didnt want to do that, and PGL forgot about that conversation. However, the topic of money continued to be discussed. PGL were actively insisting, This is all the budget youve got, there wont be any more money. The talents started to get annoyed; PGLs indifference was stupefying for many. A week before the official announcement, the Romanians simply ceased all communication with the Russian-language talents, ignoring them completely. Nice business tactic there, present them with a fait accompli and then just ignore them. Many considered pulling out of the tournament. Perhaps if that decision had been made, wed have been able to break PGL. But this being a domestic Major who everyone, with no exceptions, wanted to work at, the pressure was much too strong for us to be able to gather our willpower and walk out. In the end, PGLs tactic worked. While they were ignoring our folks, and we for our part couldnt reach a consensus, the official announcement was made, and there was nothing more to be done. PGL had won.
 
People stopped thinking about money; the important thing was after all to make sure the domestic Major goes well, to prove that the CIS deserved to see a return of Valves tournaments in the seasons to come. A few days before the tournament, the talents from Russia found out that thered be no invites from the organizers, i.e. PGL didnt care at all whether people would get to Kiev or not, it just wasnt their concern. Visas are another matter, where no-one is protected from a potential refusal. But people have always been getting invitations. Here, however, the approach was sort it out on your own. Its very fortunate that RuHub and Starladder are based in Kiev, as it was they who sent the invitation to the Russians. However, PGLs indifference started to get positively irritating at that point.

The talents from Russia were scheduled to arrive on April 20. And accommodated at a $400-a-night hotel. Yet again, one is left wondering: whats the point of bringing people in four days in advance, when they could arrive a day or two before the tournament (the Kiev/Moscow difference is indeed greater than, say, the Moscow/Seattle one) and bring in another person with the money saved (13 x 400 x 2 = $10,400). In the end, they didnt have to book a hotel for the Kiev folks (v1lat, Faker, GodHunt and Goblak), and that would have given them the money to bring in another person or even two. Yet PGL has a certain problem reasoning logically. 

After everyone arrived and was accommodated, the Romanians decided to have a private conversation with v1lat so that an earlier, unfinished chat on Skype could be brought to a meaningful conclusion. In the course of that meeting, it turned out PGL had FORGOTTEN that a tournament required a presenter on stage, an interviewer and an interpreter. No big deal, you know, just the main organizer of a tournament forgetting to invite three extra people, happens all the time. Vitaly was told the following: Its your crowd, and frankly, we dont care what youre going to do. Have the interviews interpreted if you wish, or dont. This is your business, its got nothing to do with us. I suppose it goes without saying that Vitaly was not going to get any additional payment for taking charge of these tasks.

Naturally, Vitaly wasnt satisfied with this arrangement, and refused it (although he did act as an interpreter in the end). Salary raises continued to be discussed that same evening. PGL only agreed to give some extra coin (1,200 gold instead of 1,000) to a single person: Faker, the main host. The following explanation was provided: We took a look at the schedule and didnt expect there to be so much work. Towards the end of the tournament, theyd go back on their promise and say hed be getting as much as the others, seeing as there was no budget for anything else after allhence 1,000, and thats the end of that.
A new catering strategy was also tested at the tournament: people ordered food from restaurants with MCW Events twice a day, and the latter was in charge of delivery. I dont want to go into detail on that situation, but long story short, half of the orders took 4 hours to be delivered, some werent delivered at all, some people had their orders mixed up, etc. Overall, no-one was surprised, as that system had looked flawed from the outset.

It was tournament time. The English broadcasters were working from Romania, and the Russian ones, from the CyberArena in Kiev. First game; everythings fine. Except the English stream had live reporting with cameras at the hotel, and the Russian one didnt. Why not? Because the Romanians had forgotten there was a Russian stream. Thankfully, the head producer of the Russian broadcast took to flooding the Romanians inboxes until, starting from the second game, the live reports were there. 

Also people might have noticed that the look of the Russian stream was quite different from what PGL was showing. The problem was that the tournaments chief organizer was acting as if they were exclusively a contractor of the English stream and no-one else. For this reason, plans concerning the content of the English stream were never put forward. 

But that wasnt the problem. Our analysts biggest complaint was the absence of ordinary laptops. This was something that had never been seen at a tournament before. Of late, folks had stopped bringing their own laptops, seeing as organizers often ask not to put them in shot, since some models would not fit in and would ruin the visual cohesion, etc. That was why there were no personal laptops at the tournament. Neither, however, had any been provided by the organizers. And that problem wasnt dealt with before the end of the tournament, even though there were some hopes. The absence of laptops adversely affected the quality of analysts work, as they had to analyze matches based solely on what the observer was showing, and nothing else.
 
The group stage trudged to its conclusion; streams were on for 15 hours a day, but everyone was preparing for the playoffs, so there werent any particularly strong misgivings. Everybody wanted to focus their attention on what was the main event of the year for the CIS. 

The plan for the analysis room was to make it very impressive-looking and swanky. But then on the night before the broadcast, the table that was supposed to be inside it broke, so we had to fetch the one from the CyberArena. No-one went into details on how and why it had broken, but it already was a bit of a disappointment. Later, there was information that the broken table story was made up, and thered been no table to begin with. That information, however, is an unconfirmed rumor, so well leave it at that. There were also no laptops, but you could already see that on our streams. 

The following directions came from the Romanians during the playoff stage: Anyone who wasnt officially invited to cover this tournament CANNOT take part in activities. Youve seen live segments with Dendi, XBOCT, ArtStyle, Resolut1on, and Fly. That was initially forbidden. PGL itself stopped bothering about its own rule on the second day of the playoffs, and we made use of the opportunity. Aside from that, the credit for what did go on the streamwhat there was of itshould go to the talents and the Russian production team. PGL was entirely fine with just having an analysis, match, analysis type of broadcast, without any video content if need be. 

All of the camera people, editors, interviewers and others worked pro bono here; they received no payment for their work. And, most importantly, PGL had complaints even there. In the CyberKiev video where v1lat was sitting on the CyberArena stage talking about the history of Dota and the Kiev esports scene, the Romanians spotted a half-covered Blizzard logo behind his back. Notably, Valve wasnt particularly bothered about it, while PGL simply couldnt live it down. Here we see them no longer completely unconcerned about what was going on the Russian stream. They simply sought to complicate things for everyone, and they were willing to use any petty pretext for that. 

There was a clear problem with the schedule and match times. Playing would go on for 16 hours, partially due to large pauses between individual games and the series themselves. However, on the third day, PGL shortened the airtime of various interview at its own discretion, so games now took a little less time to begin. Nevertheless, it did not crucially affect the schedule, as the third matchday still finished long past midnight. However, the organizers showed understanding in responding to this situation (their only appropriate response during the tournament), and thus they allowed the analysis panel to finish working earlier and get at least 56 hours of sleep (here we ought to point out that these people woke up an hour and a half before going live, and went to bed half an hour after broadcasting ended). 

The problem of PGLs indifference to the Russian-language talents manifested itself in every kind of small details. For example, on the first day, the talents asked for juice to be added to the selection of drinks, where Red Bulls and sodas were on offer. PGL ignored that request for two days. At the tournament itself, there were several Valve representatives, and when on the third day the talent asked the same of Valve, juice and ice tea were available at the canteen a mere hour later. A small but very telling detail. 

As workers, we were left with an ambivalent feeling after the tournament. The home crowd had certainly saved the event; everybody was pleased to work for their own audience, and gave it their best. But many of us strongly resented PGLs indifference and complete lack of interest in delivering a good product to the local audience. Were anything but spoilt, but none of us had ever encountered an attitude like that at a Valve tournament. It was this indifference, this couldnt-care-less mindset, that led me to write this letter.

Id like to end my letter on the same note I started it with. Dear Valve, please make sense of this situation and conduct your own investigation. The Russian-language talents and production staff are at the end of their strength and willingness to work with PGL on any future event. I hope you will take steps and well once again be able to bring joy and positivity that will not only be characteristic of our work, but also felt by us when we arent facing the cameras. 
For their part, readers and ordinary viewers will probably be able to draw a lot of interesting information from all thats been written here.
To summarize, lets go through the main points of this letter:

1.  The Manila Major was fantastic; we were endeared by the comfortable working environment the organizers had created.
2.  Ahead of Boston, Valve implements a new system of studio operation, with on-site commentators and stay-at-home analysis panels. There is a need for an additional contractor for the analysis panel.
3.  PGL announces a bidding procedure, but makes its own choice in favor of Starladder even before the deadline for the bids, as the head of PGL is good friends with the head of Starladder.
4.  Valve finds out about this manipulation and hands organizing Boston over to RuHub. Meanwhile, the budget PGL was supposed to provide for setting up the studio is virtually nonexistent, and RuHub spends a big amount of money out of its own pocket.
5.  Information appears ahead of The Kiev Major about a talent-selecting committee whose members names are not disclosed. Its never established who these people are and what gives weight to their votes. 
6.  PGL present everyone with their invitations as a fait accompli, without any mention of salaries. Over the two weeks that follow, the Romanians dodge the question, and then say the pay will be the same as in Boston; when an attempt is made to discuss a raise, they cite a limited budget and begin to ignore all attempts at contact.
7.  Kiev Major becomes the first tournament whose organizers refuse to send invitations to talents and say it isnt their problem.
8.  After everyone has gathered in Kiev, PGL organize a meeting with Vilat, at which they mention in conversation that they are completely indifferent to what happens on the Russian stream, whether it will have translations of interviews, live reporting, or anything else. This is not the concern of the tournaments chief organizer. 
9.  Every request made during the course of the tournament, even a small one, is completely ignored by PGL. Meanwhile, Valve staff present at the same event resolve the same issues in minutes. 
10.  PGLs indifference to Russian coverage is haunting people throughout the event. Instead of the tournaments chief organizer, PGL look like a contractor of the English stream.

Came from /r/all - Never watched or played DOTA2 before - That was some Olympics-level entertainment...|self.DotA2|~I've heard about dota2 and LoL but I've never played either.  I'm 30 years old and haven't played a serious game since WoW's Lich King expansion.  
The most hardcore game I play these days is Clash Royale on iOS lol

Anyway, I stumbled into that championship tonight via front page and this video linked on the side was INCREDIBLY helpful: [First Timer's Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_L4Q_FRcyY)

Even though I only discovered the video to help me understand what I was watching mid-way through game 2, I had a **blast** watching and will definitely watch more in the future.

COOL STUFF!
idk \\\_()_/ 

*Big takeaways (maybe y'all will find these fun?)*:  
- Twitch chat is God awful.  
- I think people hate Void? Whatever that is? OP? idk  
- I basically just spent the whole time watching health bars at the top of the screen, rather than the action in the middle.  It was giving me seizures and I didn't understand the chaos anyway lol  
- THE FANS ARE NUTS!  
- Lastly, you have something like 100+ characters? wtf is wrong with all of you that you subject yourselves to this kind of chaos?  I can't imagine trying to learn the ins and outs to be prepared to fight against them all.  

**tl;dr**: Came from /r/all, watched a good newbies guide to watching dota2, had shittons of fun.

*Edit*: Dang and I wake up to 2.4k upDOTAs, front page of your sub, and a ton of return love.  Thanks, y'all!~|shout esports

Valve need to hire PGL permanently to do every major.|self.DotA2|~They have been absolutely amazing and been so active on here taking feedback and actually making changes mid event. 

Definitely the highest production value we have ever had at a major. This addition of the mana bars just put PGL over the top for me, its a small thing but its something we have wanted for years. After one person on reddit asks if PGL could put it up all the time, u/RobertPGL replies like 30 mins later saying its done. Mind = Blown

WESG wants to deduct my team's winnings, telling my team and I to pay for 5 return airtickets amounting to 1700USD|self.DotA2|~This is my very first time on Reddit. Many friends and gamers told me i could post here and seek for advice and help. I thought about it, and its really unpleasant to make a post here as the tournament is still going on (Finals in March 2018). However, i would like to reach out to all managers and players to be very careful with booking of their air tickets and I sincerely do not want this to happen to another team and their players. (Please bear with my bad English, and correct me as I go along, Thank you)

Our Team Kazakhstan won first in their qualifiers and therefore attained tickets and a slot at the regional APAC finals at WESG. Visas were so difficult to get approved from the China Embassy, whether individual or group visa. As for individual visas, I had tried to request for "barcodes" from Alisports for instant approval, but after waiting for 3 weeks, Alisports told me its not possible to get barcodes anymore, and told me to find other ways to attain our visas. I then told my players to get group visas, which needed a lot of documents (for example, bank statements, and police statements, and many more).
One of my team player was located at another far end of Kazakhstan, and he flew to the main city to try and get his individual visa done but to no avail, as there are only 2 Chinese Embassies in Kazakhstan, and the one he flew to, do not issue individual visas without barcodes.

Monday, 8th January was our proposed starting date of WESG lan. We are instructed to be there at 8th January to report at the hotels. And we only attained our group visas at 5th January (worth 420 USD), and I asked for 2 way tickets, routing from Kazakhstan to China (back and forth), I even drafted a route with all my 5 players domestic flights and told the interpreter to book the flights proposed. I received a proposed flight plan back, and it was not as i stated in the email, but because all the flights that was in the proposal could bring my players back to their respective cities, i said yes, and told them to hurry with the ordering of tickets. 
Some domestic flights started at Sunday morning, and All my players had to fly to Almaty, Kazakhstan, then take a flight together to Beijing. And i will meet them in Beijing via a flight from Singapore. And then 6 of us will take the same flight from Beijing to Qingdao (WESG lan). Many times i asked the interpreter to put me on the same flight with them from Beijing, but apparently (later i found out) she did not convey this message to the tour agency, and just told me "its not possible". I received the tickets all on Saturday morning, and i paid 80 USD from my own pocket to get the flight changed, so i can meet my players and fly with them together to qingdao. 
 
Food was mentioned to be provided for all days throughout WESG, but it was not the case for the first day (and also last day of WESG) when we arrived. Many teams were shocked that food was not provided on first day, but we were all excited and did not really bother about it. Organisers told us that because they were not able to estimate the number of teams that would arrive on the first day, and therefore did not order food for us on first day. 
Anyways, this is not the main issue, WESG APAC was completed successfully, and the event was a blast. All players enjoyed themselves in that one week and we all had flights back to our countries on 15th January. We won 3rd place at the event by the way.

15th January Monday itself, i paid again out from my pocket to fly back to Singapore via Shenzhen, to my family business lodging at a later time, because WESG gave me tickets that were so early in the morning at 0755am, and this means i had to leave my players alone in China all the way until 2200Hrs at night where they will have their domestic flight from Qingdao to Beijing. I ve never really planned to leave them alone, so ive changed my tickets to depart at 1800hrs instead. We were notified to check out of hotel rooms at 12noon, but i paid for the room to be extended until 1800hrs, (like some other managers did the same as well) for the safety and comfort of our players.

My team went from Qingdao to Beijing, reaching Beijing at midnight. Then a problem arised that they were not able to have boarding passes for their respective flights as they were on group visas, and they need to leave China together via the same flight. 3 boys leave on one flight from Beijing to Astana at about 2:30am, and the other 2 boys will leave from Beijing to Almaty at 5:55am. The Beijing airport requires all domestic flights passengers to check out of the airport and to check in again with baggage, and they do not have ample time to wait for answers and confirmation and thus they missed the very first flight to astana. So team leader tried to contact me via public phone calling to my Singapore number but i did not notice the calls until about 630am, and team leader told me that they needed group airtickets. 
I frantically called WESG organisers, and asked them for help, they were fast on helping me, and tickets were booked for them, however, they needed to stay in the airport for one more entire day as the flights were early morning at 5:55am as a group this time. Throughout the time, i attained the contact of the tour agency lady, AA . who initially booked the tickets and she was in doubt about who was paying for the new tickets. 
Alisports then dropped the bomb on me saying they will deduct the air tickets from our prize winnings.

Its now 24th Jan, and I am still disputing this 1700 USD. They insisted that we should shoulder this amount as we confirmed the tickets before we took our flights to China.
I wrote an email (i cut the email short here) to dispute the airticket charges, stating these points, with picture evidences and screen shots of our convos and emails.

"1) Team Manager already informed interpreter XX, about 5 times during conversation, that our team booked group visa. It was proven to XX via emails, and via wechat convos. 

2) Team Manager do not have direct contact communication with Ms AA (tour agency lady), and when Manager asked Ms AA whether she was informed about the group visas, Ms AA claimed she was not informed at all about this important and crucial information. If she had known we had group visas, She would book return tickets as a group from Beijing into Kazakhstan because of her profession as a tour agency agent, she knows about this visa rule. 

3) Manager asked for 2 way tickets for the trips and also stated in the email that they are travelling on group visas, (5 times mentioned to interpreter, XX), when the tour agency gave us the draft copy, we readily respected the wishes of the tour agency because we trusted WESG to be informed of our travelling documents and visas, as we are only players/team and we do not have knowledge about ticketing terms and conditions. 

4) Terms and conditions of the tickets were not known to us when WESG purchased the tickets. We were not aware that group visas required us to have the same exact tickets when travelling out of Beijing. 

This email dispute is not to blame, not to find fault and not to be critical against our interpreter, but if words and messages are not conveyed in the proper manner, or there is communication breakdown because of a middle man, Then maybe WESG committee can see the loopholes and we all can improve on our errors and mistakes. 
if you need further proof, I can attach it via email for u. Please let me know if you need it, because i am giving the interpreter the benefit of the doubt, that she will say the truth with me. 

Please kindly understand our positions, and we came to China, empty handed. I hope our prize money can help our family and the bad gaming conditions at home and make us be a better team for March finals. 

Many thanks and Best regards,
Manager of Team Kazakhstan. "   

Today, 24th Jan, the director of Alisports Esports committee called me,  and told me that the final decision has not been made yet. And alisports Still wants me to cover the cost of the air tickets. 
I am hereby desperate, and i am seeking fellow gaming community to give me advice and help on how to resolve this situation. We are only participants of this event, if we did not win this 10k USD, would Alisports help us with the booking of return tickets? one nice guy from alisports said yes, but now, i would like to tell all teams, with managers or without, that if you guys have group visas, it is required for you to enter and also leave the participating country together as a group. No one but the travel agencies knows about this visa rule, and yet this information was not passed to her.... The director told me this has never happened in the history of WESG. =( 
Help me please. I think i really need help this time. 

Thank you for patience. 
Love,
Moon, Manager for Team Kazakhstan~|complaint esports
VP had Noone playing for them in game 4 under Aloha's account|self.DotA2|~I was watching Noone's stream when he suddenly abandoned and said he was asked to play for VP. The VOD is now deleted, but I guess viewers can confirm. Here's the game which he abandoned - 2398831814 (he was Sven, it's his smurf).


So just out of curiosity I went to find VP's match. Turned out they were facing Ad Finem in The Summit 5 European Qualifiers Finals. And here it was - Aloha was disconnected for a long time, admins were forcing an unpause. Fng said something like 'Please, 2 more minutes, his PC's asking for a code, because he went to an internet cafe to play', which is bullshit, I believe, Aloha never went to a cafe, he was at home waiting for his internet to work again, he even twitted 'now my internet works' soon after that. It was Noone who was trying to log under Aloha's account and thus needed a code. Ad Finem agreed to wait 2 more minutes, but reconnect never happened. I suppose, it's because the system not always (or never in reborn?) allows to reconnect to a game using a different computer.


VP played 4v5 and soon lost the game. Then the next one started, Aloha seemed to be back, he was playing Juggernaut, but the way he arranged his items wasn't the way he always does. And this is crucial. All players always stick to the same item-pattern and never change it during important series. ESPECIALLY THE BOOTS.


Now, look. The game I'm talking about: http://i.imgur.com/fimRbKc.png, all other Aloha's Juggernaut games: http://i.imgur.com/tIWmnBt.png, and here it is - Noone's Juggernaut games: http://i.imgur.com/0FYPsMj.png. See? So I guess, it really was Noone playing under Aloha's acc and I don't think this is allowed :)

I learned a lot by talking to a lady outside of TI|self.DotA2|~She's an older lady, but she says she's been doing her job for all the TIs. At TIs, she said she's the one who meets the players at the airports, she also waits for them outside the player entrances and helps coordinate the busses as well.  

It's my first TI, and I actually just came to her for help (asking about Fisher lawn, where the players enter, etc.) and we ended up talking for a long time. She told me about how Dendi was really nice to her, and she was sad he couldn't come to this TI. She also talked about Loda, but she actually referred to him as Jonathan, his first name.  

When Team Empire arrived yesterday, Resolution jumped out of the bus incredibly energized, running around. The first thing he did was run up to this lady and hug her. It was so sweet. She said Dendi would do that too.  

I wish I could have talked to her more. Yesterday she was standing outside of the press entrance. She enjoys talking and helping out others.

##**Drama**

#[](/pennant-eg) Aui_2000 kicked from EG. 
* [Aui_2000 tweets he's been kicked from EG.](https://twitter.com/Aui_2000/status/632366266536214528) - "i have been kicked from eg after winning ti. i actually hate people"
* [Aui_2000 asks for confirmations](https://twitter.com/Aui_2000/status/632370306670170113): - "can someone from eg just fucking confirm so idiots stop tweeting me its fake"

  **1\.** [EE confirms.](https://twitter.com/EternaLEnVy1991/status/632371194264723456) - "I'll confirm it if if means anything :("

  **2\.** [Whatiship confirms.](https://twitter.com/WhatIsHipTV/status/632369771380523008) - "yes AUI is actually kicked from EG. guess teams really do place value on some players rather than others."

  **3\.** [Mikey from FaceIt confirms.](https://twitter.com/Faceit_Mikey/status/632376798001635328) - "Aui out, Arteezy to carry, Fear to support. ~~ EG's team for Majors CONFIRMED.
Lets now stop speculating...Wait for EU shuffle... #dota2"

  **4\.** [Charlie officially confirms.](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sn8s65) - 

        Rather than have people speculate or message players for answers, I'm going to go ahead and announce the new EG Dota 2 roster: Sumail, Universe, Fear, PPD, and Arteezy. 
        
        Yes, Kurtis was removed from the roster. The rest of the players decided that the above roster was what they wanted to go forward with. 
        
        Personally, I'm deeply affected by this and I'm very sad to see Kurtis go. I've known him the longest out of anyone on the team. He was the one that originally asked me to be the manager for Potm Bottom years ago, and I cannot state enough how depressed I am to see him go. I cannot imagine how much worse he feels.
        
        Professionally, I trust the judgment of the captain and the other players. I will not make roster decisions on their behalf and I will not force players to play on rosters they don't want to play on. EG is deeply grateful to Kurtis for what he has helped contribute, and will continue to support him in whatever he decides to do and wherever he decides to go. I say this both for myself and on behalf of the organization.

Valve, this compendium sucked ass.|self.DotA2|~I've purchased every compendium since TI3, and always did so as a way to keep tabs on the tournament. The first iteration of the compendium had so many awesome interactive features, like predictions on every stage of the tournament, selecting your favorite player/team, collecting player trading cards, etc. 

I bought the Frankfurt Major compendium expecting at least some of those features. Player profiles, or main event predictions or something. And every week I've thought, "oh maybe they'll add it in today!", but nope. This compendium has nothing to do with frankfurt. My money didn't go into the prize pool, there's no interaction with the tournament. It's just a shitty bundle of items, wrapped in a shitty betting system, wrapped under the guise of digital sports. 

Will not be buying the next one, and if I could, I'd get refund on this one. ~|complaint esports

Another 65 days to go. Maybe $15 Million isn't a crazy goal. :) Congrats Dota community. Well paid!

**For the non-Dota Crowd**

[The International](http://www.dota2.com/international/announcement/) is an annual tournament hosted by Valve Software for their action real time strategy game '[Dota 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/570/)' where 16 of the finest teams from across the world compete against each other for the world championship, massive prize pool that this thread is about and all the glory in the world.

Valve seeds $1.6 Million USD as the prize pool of the event with the Dota 2 community having the opportunity to add to the prize pool by purchasing the '[Interactive Compendium](http://www.dota2.com/international/compendium/)'. For every Compendium purchased, 25% ($2.50) of the sales are added to the prize pool of the event.

The Interactive Compendium this year was launched on May 9, 2014 and the Dota 2 community have purchased enough of them until today to have boosted the prize pool to over $10,000,000 technically adding over 5 times the base prize pool to the event.

**TL;DR -** $10 Million Dollars and more. 16 finest Dota Teams. July 18-21. KeyArena, Seattle. Do tune in so you can tell your kids you caught it live before it was cool.

An Open Letter to all the big Esports Companies Out There|self.DotA2|~Dear Important People*,  
  
*(You all know who you are, you're the ones who run the whole shebang. You're organising tournaments, you're booking talent, you're the ones assembling a list of people and teams and so forth. You're the ones with all the cheddar and people like me are the tiny little mice trying to get some for our starving mice families. We live in a hole in the wall. A HOLE IN THE WALL.)  
  
This is a simple request: please can you try to plan ahead a little further than two weeks at a time. I can't believe for one second that you are living day to day after all these years of Dota 2 being on the scene. Take a calendar, look at the dates on it, plan ahead a few months and think to yourselves "maybe people will have their own shit planned unless we give them a head's up".  
  
It's fine, I get it. You're worried something will change. You're worried you might need to shift a date, or someone will emerge from the shadows and you want to hire them instead of the person you spoke to three months ago. Well that's not cool. Everyone has a life of their own outside Dota (except Tobi obviously) and everyone needs a bit of notice before they fly halfway around the World to watch videogames for a couple of weeks.  
  
I realise this is not your problem, but at the very least you could understand why it's someone else's problem, and it's one of your making.  
  
Sincerely,

Statement regarding speculation around Ana situation.|self.DotA2|~Ive repressed my feelings on the subject since January and was essentially forced to leave it and move on due to a mixture of personal hurt, a busy schedule and lifes many other priorities. Regrettably, the attention this situation has generated in addition to blatant speculation of my character in a public podcast streamed on twitch, youtube, and multiple Reddit threads have forced me into compiling this evidence to establish the facts and timeline of events.



Facts and timeline

* Conversations with Anas brother that shows I started talking to Anas family regarding professional esports back in 2014. https://imgur.com/a/8O3li


* This is my wife writing a sponsorship/invitation letter for Ana to apply for a VISA for entry and stay in Shanghai. https://imgur.com/a/oCSMG

* This shows a small portion of dialogue that proves I did, in fact, negotiate Ana onto OG. There are a lot more negotiations (not only on twitter) but I do not want to disclose any more private conversations than I need to out of respect for Tal (OG.Fly). https://imgur.com/a/ISSVZ

* This is a skype log between an OG player and myself, it details the story from my side so I dont have to rewrite it again. Identity is blurred out of respect for that person. Please do note that when I have contacted players regarding this drama I made sure it is at a time that they are not playing any major tournaments as to not affect their performance. https://imgur.com/a/t7LBn

* Here is a chat log where Ana acknowledges my being his agent/manager and also that I suspected he and his family may betray me by not honoring their end of the deal. https://imgur.com/a/JefwL

* This is the contract I signed with Ana after leaving IG and before even negotiating with OG (Please note the timestamp of contract as well as the timestamps on the twitter messages with OG.Fly). https://imgur.com/a/qq5qa

    Please note that the contract expires on Anas 18th birthday, not 50 years as some people have speculated.
 
    Finally, the first agreement we agreed to before signing IG was with a 30% fee, but because he found success much earlier than I had anticipated (Winning NEA), I offered to lower it without Ana or his mother asking and re-entered the agreement with my fee lowered considerably to 10%. 

* This is an email transcript between OG manager and myself. https://imgur.com/a/jtfJx

* Aggrieved by the situation at hand, I was constrained to send this letter of demand to Ana and his mom. https://imgur.com/a/wdGVH

* Ive linked the TI player profile for Ana you can see my involvement in Anas quick rise to stardom has been completely omitted. To my surprise, it was made to appear like they have always been supportive and that IG reached out to Ana on their own. Moreover, Anas mum says that Shanghai is her hometown and thats why she sent him, however, instead of staying with family, Ana stayed with me under my care, guidance, and supervision. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h93757dO6DE


I wish I could go back in time and not have to go through any of this, I cant help but feel betrayed after all the work I put in only to be ignored for such a little sum of money. I was blocked since January this year and in that time I have quit Dota2, I didnt even watch TI since I knew Ana would be competing.  

I like to think I am a reasonable guy, all I want is Ana to honor the original agreement and an apology. Every cent received by me minus legal fees will go to either a charity of /r/dota2s choice or a players-only tournament in which we can discover new talented players to join the pro dota2 scene (No established pros allowed).

A lot of readers, especially the Chinese fans of dota2 have speculated and attacked my character because I defended Anas rights against IG. I just want to express that as Anas then manager/agent I acted on Anas best interest and that the issue is now resolved.

Ana, I know you are reading this and probably wont reach out to me. I hope you can grow from this and I wish you the best of luck in future endeavors.

The Chinese Perspective on the 2GD Drama: Why GabeN's hand might have been forced|self.DotA2|~**Warning: Long post ahead**

In the last few days there's been a lot of commentary and speculation on the 2GD drama. One thing that's been missing is the Chinese perspective, which I've seen some people ask for but hasn't been provided. I'll try to give an overview (I am currently living in Shanghai).

I think the fact that this controversy happened in China is important to understanding why thing played out the way they did. A lot of what I'm going to say is speculation, just because nobody knows all the fact right now. But I don't think most people on /r/dota2 get how different China is even with past drama with Chinese tournaments. There's a thread on the front page right now about "Chris Rock made memey jokes at the Oscars, same thing as 2GD right?" Completely ignores that one is in USA and one is in China.

I looked on Weibo and Tieba to gauge the average Chinese netizens' reaction to the controversy (one unrelated thing you guys may find interesting that I'd forgotten about, the Chinese nickname for GabeN is Fat G). Anyway, the most common reaction was "Who the hell is 2GD", as you might expect. However, the second most common reaction was different variations of **"He was hosting the show and made a sex joke? Serves him right, of course he was fired."**

China's government tightly controls all media in the country, and one of the most longstanding rules is the near-complete ban on sexual content and pornography. Basically all porn is blocked on the internet. James's opening joke on the first day was possibly the worst you could think of. Not only did he reference porn and masturbation, he talked about circumventing the government internet blocks in order to watch porn. While he was in China. In front of a camera talking into a microphone.

The Shanghai Major is a pretty big deal, when I found out they got the Mercedez-Benz Arena for the finals I was actually very surprised. Its where the World Expo was in 2010, and where big international music stars do concerts. It's like Staples Center in LA or Madison Square Garden in NYC. It's bigger than KeyArena by any measure. I remember a huge Taylor Swift concert being held there last year.

So yeah, it's a pretty big deal and Valve/Perfect World most likely had to do a LOT of negotiating and utilize a great deal of [guanxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanxi) in order to get this confirmed. 

Now imagine Gabe's reaction when he hears about this at Valve HQ. "James did what??" Granted, as we know Gabe didn't know about Icefrog telling James to be himself which is definitely a breakdown in communications at Valve. But again, James made one of the worse jokes you could make, basically making a sex joke and subverting the Chinese government joke in the same sentence, the moment after Gabe puts him in front of a camera. At this point Gabe didn't yet fire him, but he was definitely on two strikes. This is speculation, but I'd imagine the "bottom bitch" comment was the last straw. Seems pretty innocuous in the USA, but it does have sexual connotations.

I want to note at this point that I'm no prude and most (young) Chinese people aren't either. I, like James, use methods to get around the internet blocks to access certain forbidden sites. But nobody talks about it, that's just how the culture is, and nobody would dare talk about it in front of a camera. I have a (white American) friend who was an exchange student in China two years ago, and he made a minor masturbation joke in his Chinese class at a Beijing university. His teacher, a girl who I also know, was shocked speechless for 2 minutes. This girl isn't a prude either and goes clubbing on weekends but my point is that in China you just. don't. talk about sex in any sort of "official" setting.

In this kind of culture, James' actions came across as a boorish ignorant tourist. Except he was a boorish ignorant tourist with a mic in front of a camera. I like James' content and I've been watching GD Studio for a long time. But it was clear that James has no conception of how whats acceptable to say on-air is different in the USA/UK and China.

So Gabe has a decision to make, not just for the group stage, but the main stage. Group stage was more low-key, but I think Gabe ultimately decided he didn't want to run the risk of James making another sex joke while sitting on the main stage in the Mercedes-Benz center. Again, this is the biggest entertainment venue in the biggest city in China - I can almost guarantee the Shanghai municipal government officials will be monitoring the Main Event in some way. One more sex joke on the main stage and there's a lot of bad blood between Valve and Chinese officials, and Valve's access to a huge chunk of the Dota2 playerbase just got a helluva lot more difficult. 

James' "bottom bitch" comment was probably interpreted by Gabe as "well either he didn't get my NO MORE SEX JOKES message or he's intentionally defying it" and led to the "James is an ass" comment. For the record, I'm not saying I agree with Gabe's comment, but I'm trying to explain (as much for myself as for anybody else) what might have led to that comment.

Thanks for reading, and I welcome any comments, especially from any other Chinese people who might be browsing this sub, see if I missed anything.

**EDIT**: To address one of the most common comments on this thread - Yeah, hosting a major in China definitely brings a shit ton of problems. I'm not going to make a judgment on whether Valve should or shouldn't have one in China in the future. It was definitely Valve's fault in regard to the Icefrog miscommunication and not prepping James beforehand. However, I will also say that IMO last year's DAC was a pretty successful large-scale tournament in China, and as many people have said, Valve probably hoped the Shanghai Major would basically be DAC but even better. That obviously hasn't happened with the KeyTV P R O D U C T I O N V A L U E + 2GD Drama

**EDIT 2: REGARDING THE "NOBODY IN CHINA EVEN WATCHES ENGLISH STREAM WTF" ARGUMENT:**

I acknowledged that most Chinese dota watchers don't watch English stream and don't know who 2GD is. However, there are those who do, and some of those who do post the news on social media sites, just like how people find out news about Burning, rotK, LaNm, xiao8 here on /r/dota2. Would probably not be a good look for Valve in China if even a few Chinese social media sites started talking about a Valve host making dirty jokes in the Benz arena. ~|fluff esports
Public apology to the DOTA 2 community|self.DotA2|~Hello everyone,

As producer and showrunner, I want to apologize on behalf of PGL for airing the clip that closed the broadcast of the Kiev Major.
 
A lot of people were disappointed and the high expectations set for us were not met. We let you down, and the clip does not reflect PGL's values, team diversity or broadcast philosophy.
 
We have the utmost respect for the Dota 2 community and, going forward, the video production workflow will be improved with additional checks and quality filters to ensure that mistakes like this will not happen again.
 
Everything we do is for the community and your feedback is and always will be very important to us.
 
Thank you for helping us do better next time.~|announce esports

With the TI6 main event about 10 hours away, I wanted to share my TI "Core Memories" with you|self.DotA2|~Greetings and **EXTREMELY LONG POST AHEAD WARNING**, Dota fans!

Over the past week or so, as I've been reading through all of the threads and discussions about TI6, I've caught myself acting like the old man I am... meaning I've been leaving many comments about the way-back-when days, sharing memories and spinning yarns. And inevitably as I've shared those thoughts and experiences, even more have come to mind. Going back in time and remembering that part of my life has brought me a lot of bittersweet joy. Now with the main event only a handful of hours away, I can't think of a better time to share my TI core memories with you, given that all of you have been there with me every step of the way.

If I'm honest, there's also an emotional healing element to all of this which will be made clear by the end. There are a lot of things involving the family nature of GoodGame, Evil Geniuses, and Alliance and how tight nit we are which I think the community will appreciate.

I've decided to skip stories about commentating particular games or series, and except in cases where exceptions are obvious, anything about gameplay/results as a whole. Most people have seen those moments. At any rate, I hope you enjoy... I know I did, through the ups and downs alike.

**TI2**

---

**First time walking into TI**

* I had only been playing Dota for eight months and casting it for five when I arrived in Seattle and walked into Benaroya to cast TI2 at the invitation of IceFrog. I toddled into that foyer with the awkwardness of a kid on his first day at a new school. I walked up to the first group of people I spotted wearing Valve shirts, stuck out my hand, and said "Hi, I'm Ayesee." Doug Wood of Valve turned and said, "I recognize that voice!" Afterward, I introduced myself to Tobi, who went out of his way to guide me around and introduce me to all of the other casters, hosts, and panelists who'd go on to be some of my best friends and favorite people in the world. [I'll always be thankful to him for that](http://i.imgur.com/DSRLUqA.jpg).

**Meeting Gabe Newell**

* Second day I was there, before the event even started, sitting down in the cafeteria/green room area used by talent and staff by myself drinking a diet coke. In walks Gabe, who sits down RIGHT beside me. Starstruck, I stuck out my hand and said, "Hey Mr. Newell, I'm Aaron..." and he shook my hand and said "Of course I know you, you're Ayesee." To this day, I have no words to describe that feeling. It wasn't pride. It was something closer to humility mixed with validation. Feeling humbled that you were given the chance to do the work you do, intertwined with a feeling of graciousness that you'd done something right to be alive in that experience.

**My first real Greetings and Salutations**

* Sure, I'd said it hundreds (if not thousands) of times on stream before... but saying those words live to a packed audience at a million dollar tournament, in a moment that represented a genuine dream come true is just... well, different. Yes, I had worked in radio for years, but in radio you're alone in a small studio, you can't feel or see your audience. Staring out over the sea of people, it hit me - hundreds of thousands of people were at home, and thousands were in front of me, waiting for me to be a voice for their memories of this moment. My hands started to shake, my chest started to tremble. I heard the producer in my ear say "GO COMMENTATORS," and as if someone had hit a button, I bellowed out my greetings... and the crowd roared in response. I've never been nervous in front of an audience since that moment.

**Meeting Alex Garfield**

* After TI2 I was milling around the lobby while the DJ spun his tunes for the after party, when a guy in an EG shirt came up to me and asked what I thought of the event. I didn't recognize him, but he had the most profound look of focus and understanding in his eyes. Everything about him screamed "this seems like a cool guy." We talked and shot the shit about the event, the matches, etc until a Team Liquid writer interrupted us. He said "I see what's going on! Trying to hire Ayesee!" I put the pieces together and realized it was THE Alex Garfield, a man I only knew as a name. I started working for EG/GGA the next month, and moved out to SF to work on site full time 8 months later - one of the first 8 founding members of our home office in the Bay. Alex's belief in me changed my life beyond my wildest dreams, and the moments we've shared together... you can't imagine. More on those later.

**Late night soccer at the Westin**

* I don't play soccer. I don't like soccer. But I'll always remember this moment because of how it sums up people who work in eSports - serious, driven individuals... who are just kids at heart. I remember coming back to the Westin very late one of the nights of the main event. I went up to the ballrooms marked off for talent to relax/eat/drink with hopes for a nightcap. What I found was a full blown game of soccer taking place in the large open area in front of the ballrooms. Almost everyone still awake was playing. I sat down, watched, and commentated. Maybe you had to be there, but it was... something special.

**Alliance wins the Grand Finals**

* I got to be that fanboy in the Alliance box, during the Grand Finals, surrounded by the friends and coworkers I loved the most. The end... the dream coil... the moment that ancient exploded. You could give me 10,000 words, and I still couldn't capture it. I remember Cody Connors jumped on my back and I jumped up and down with him ON my back. I remember I was standing right next to Alex, and he literally almost fainted - eyes fluttered and he stumbled backwards against the wall, lmao. I grabbed him, hugged him, and lifted him off the ground with tears in my eyes. We all hugged everyone else we could get our hands on, then Alex, myself, and Sean Green (GGA photographer) ran as quickly as we could down from the balcony to backstage. We were there waiting to greet our boys as soon as they walked off stage. More tears. More hugs. Everything from there is a blur - we hung around, talked and laughed, then as a group we all went to dinner... with the Aegis sitting in the middle of the table. Somewhere on someone's cell phone exists a picture of Alex and I holding the aegis together at that dinner.

---

**TI4**

---

**Not doing the main stage**

* TI4 was hard for me in a lot of ways... really hard. As a member of GGA, my day to day life and work responsibilities began to pivot away from simply casting Dota, to being a part of much larger projects in much more impactful roles. I was doing more work in eSports than ever... but doing less casting. By the time TI4 invites were set to go out, I knew there was a chance I wouldn't be asked to do the main stage that year. Which is what ended up happening. I was devastated. Like, didn't leave the house for days devastated. And being physically present at TI4 in that diminished role wasn't any easier. Even though I didn't know it at the time, that pain I was feeling was the pain of change, resulting from slow evolutions happening inside me as a person and involving me in the industry. I just wasn't ready for it. Looking back, those memories are still hard... but they were inevitable. And what got me through it was the endless support I got from Dota fans all over the world, both online and in person at that event. Thank you. You know who you are. Ultimately, even though I didn't know it at the time, my efforts and energy being required for other projects turned out to be my small part to play in our acquisition by Twitch, which was already in the works. I just didn't know that until much later.

**Getting to know the item creators**

* You know those awesome people who make the hats that keep this whole TI thing growing year after year? Listen closely when I tell you this: they are some of the most talented, funny, intelligent people you'll ever meet... and some of my favorite people in the whole world. This was the year I really got to know them - Manny, Anuxi, Danidem, Thiago, Terracotta, the list goes on and on. I've spent more nights than I can count at dinner, in bars, in hotel rooms, on rooftops, and just wandering the streets partying with these amazing folks. And no matter how many times we get together, I'm sad when we have to say goodbye and can't wait for the next chance to say hello. I'm sure some of you are reading this - please know, I love you. And you've all helped me get through some of the hardest times in my life... this year, and especially around TI5. 

---

**TI5**

---

**Note:** TI5 is hard of me to write about. Just typing that sentence has tears welling up in my eyes. It was the single most emotionally violent and turbulent period of my life I'd ever experienced. Low, to high, to low, to high again... to the lowest I've ever been. I don't know how to list these events except sequentially. I've never shared them before with anyone outside of closest friends and family... but if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do it right. The formatting for this section is a little different so bare with me.

**My first TI on the sidelines**

Title says it all. This was the first year I wasn't invited to participate in a TI as talent. If you've read this far, and read the experiences above, you can imagine how hard this was for me. By that time, though, my life had changed so much that I knew it was the next step in my transition from "Ayesee, the Dota caster" to "Ayesee, the eSports industry professional who still casts Dota when he can." Thankfully, I once again had the full GGA family around me to help me remember that while a part of my life had been left behind, it was another step towards the future.

**My Father, Ronald Chambers**

EG was in the Grand Finals. The whole gang was there. The GGA suite was packed with almost every person who was or had ever been a part of GGA... who'd ever been an Evil Genius. I can look at this moment, surrounded by all those people I was lucky enough to have in my life, all of us sharing this moment together, as one of the most profound I'd ever experienced.

EG had just won game 1 against CDEC, and we were all riding on a high that can't be comprehended. I ducked outside for some air and sunshine, and my phone rang - it was my parents calling. I answered, excited at their timing, as I could tell them all about the event so far and that our team was winning! We were THIS CLOSE to Evil Geniuses - to OUR TEAM - being TI5 champions!

I answered practically shaking with excitement. Mom knew all about EG and Dota and my work. I couldn't wait to tell her. Mom said hello, and I stammered out "Hey mom, guess what! We're doing it! EG is in the Grand Finals!" But she interrupted me. My father, who'd been having serious health problems for the last five years, had collapsed earlier that morning, and been taken to the hospital. He was in a coma. And they weren't sure if he would ever wake up.

I don't know how to verbally describe a moment like that. Every word or phrase that comes to mind feels cheap. So I'm not going to even try. I wept, and I almost fell over. I couldn't stand up without leaning on something.

I honestly don't remember what I asked her, and what she told me in specific. Just vague notions we communicated back and forth. He was in a coma, and it'd be a day or two before we knew if he had the possibility to wake up or not. He was on life support. There was nothing I could do. Nothing she could do.

I told her I was going to fly home immediately. She told me no, that I should stay. He was breathing on life support, and that wasn't going to change. If he woke up in the mean time, everything would be okay. If he didn't, that wasn't going to change by me being there. I was completely stunned. I told her I had to come home. What she said next shocked me:

"No, baby. You go win. It's what Dad would want."

And she was right. Ever since I left my old business and moved home to help her take care of Dad full time in 2011, he'd been my rock and biggest motivator. During that time, I lived with her and Dad, and did side radio/broadcasting jobs and worked in eSports to earn money. I'd take care of him most of the time, then broadcast Dota and do other eSports work in between. And while she was always supportive, it was Dad that asked me every day about eSports - about Dota, about this crazy industry I was trying to break into. It was him that, when I was invited to cast TI2, called my friends over to help him figure out how to watch me cast on his potato computer. It was him that used that potato computer to look up and read articles about Evil Geniuses and Alliance, even though he had almost no idea what he was reading... he just knew it was our teams. He knew we were Evil Geniuses. It was him that cried tears of joy when I told him I was moving to San Francisco to work in this industry full time. It was him that made me who I am today.

He was my biggest fan.

So I listened to him, and to my mother, and stayed.

**Circle the wagons**

It's a cliche, but in this case, it's true. So many of my memories about this final day are a blur - a lot of hazy images and feelings, with extremely bright and clear moments woven in. I remember going back to the GGA suite, a crying mess, and not knowing what to do but seek out Alex and Colin DeShong (GGA COO, my mentor, and my very good friend) and tell them what had happened, and that depending on when my mother called back with news, I may have to fly out on very short notice.

They barely said a word. Just hugged me, and didn't let go until I was done with needing to be hugged. Which, bless their hearts, took a while. This continued with every person in the box. Dozens of them.

They then took me up to the front row of seats in the box, and parked my ass between them. And we cheered on Evil Geniuses to victory.

**Prologue**

The day I arrived back in SF from TI, I got another call from my mother. My father was never going to wake up. I told Colin I had to leave immediately. He told me they were paying for mine and Sherry's (my GF) flights home, and that there was no date I was expected to be back. To take as long as I needed. They only wanted to hear from me if there was anything I needed, even if it was just to talk.

My father passed away on August 13th, 2015. This year's grand finals will be one year, to the day, since he passed.

I stayed home for 2-3 weeks. When I finally came back, once again it was GGA who booked my flights. And they flew us first class - the one and only time I've flown first class.

I came back to the office still a wreck, but wanted to achieve some degree of normalcy. I walked in and headed back towards our area of Twitch. I saw Alex sitting in a booth in the cafeteria with his earbuds in working on his laptop - I didn't think he saw me and he looked busy, so I walked on past.

I hadn't taken 10 more steps when I felt a hand on my shoulder - Alex had spotted me and chased me down. He hugged me and welcomed me back, and shared some words that are just for he and I.

I walked on back to our area, and was similarly welcomed back by everyone. Then, I spotted a big picture frame on my desk. 

[At the direction of Alex and Colin, GGA commissioned a very special painting for me.](http://i.imgur.com/WDA7Z3n.jpg)

At the bottom left is my father and I. Middle, the TI5 stage. The sides, my two favorite and most played Dota characters. On the back are lot of signatures and messages, most of which are too personal to share.

It's the single most valuable material possession I've ever owned.

**Thanks**

I'd imagine not many made it this far, but if you have, there they are... my TI core memories. Concerning the emotional stuff at the end, that's the healing I was talking about... and more than anything, I wanted everyone to understand how special of an organization GGA has been over the years. I couldn't have survived without them. All of these memories have been made possible by you, the Dota fans. And it's my pleasure to share them with you, the way you all so often share your own with me.

This year will be a little hard for me after TI5, and because of other changes that I can't get into. But this year will be Sherry's first eSports event ever... not a bad one to start with, huh? She'll be there with me. I hope some of you will come say hello.

Thank you, Dota community members, for allowing my life to be made up of these moments. Thank you Valve and all your staffers, for how amazingly helpful and supportive you've always been, allowing me to be a part of this historic community you've created. Thank you IceFrog, for giving an unknown commentator from West Virginia a chance. Thank you to every commentator, host, player, and personality, for letting me be a part of this special group with you.

Thank you Alex and Colin, for believing in me and making me an Evil Genius - and for being the most supportive friends for which I could ever ask. Thank you everyone at GGA for being my family in the only ways that matter. Thank you to my mother and the rest of my family, for everything.

Thank you, Dad.~|personal esports

AMA EternaLEnVy|self.DotA2|~Accepting the request from an earlier thread

"Maybe it's too much to ask an AMA from Jacky right now, but I was reading through the NoTidehunter AMA from a few years back. I feel like he's matured a lot, and would love to hear how life is going.
I would like to start with 3 questions:
Question 1 - How is the boot camp going?
Question 2 - Struggles during the TI Qualifiers?
Question 3 - Waffles or Pancakes?
Lets support some 3/5th NA Dota!"

1. Haven't started bootcamp yet we just stopped our bootcamp a few days ago after qualifiers. Funny thing is that we lost 90% of scrims during the bootcamp losing something like 15 games in a row right b4 our matches to every team. Felt significantly stronger than b4 after losing these scrims though.

2. answered it in 1

3. waffles

Appreciation post for Kaci Aitchison|self.DotA2|~I personally believe such a post should be here, because Kaci Aitchison has been absolutely fantastic to watch over the past few TI's. I'll try touching on some of the things she has been doing for the viewers and fans, alike. 


From being an unknown backstage host without any prior knowledge of the game,  due to which she got trolled by all the casters (especially Iceiceice) in her first gig, to being one of the most hyped up, cheerful and pleasent personalities of the International talent, Kaci has definitely left a mark on the Dota2 community. 


By no means am I implying that the other talent has not been outstanding, but this TI I realized  that she has been a DotA outsider who gave up a great chunk of herself to assimilate into this community, all the while being excellent at the way she has handled her interactions with pro players, the crowd and the fans.


I can't begin to imagine how tough backstage hosting would have been at this year's International, given she has been pregnant for more than a few weeks and she literally used that fact to make people laugh numerous times, which is a wonderful and heartwarming thing.

Kaci, if you ever read this, I really wanted to give a shout out to all your contributions and how terrific you have been over the years, and I believe the DotA community feels the same way. I wish you the best of health in the coming years, and hope I somehow get a chance to meet you in person. You are an absolutely wonderful personality to watch :).~|shout esports

Team Secret Pay Your Players.|self.DotA2|~So a week has gone by since EE's blog and Team Secret's "response" is insulting to say the least. No apology, no acknowledgement of the issue, just as EE said it: "empty words.". So does this mean Misery, EE, W33 and the rest are never going to get paid for their hard work? You're just going to let it slide and hope nobody notices? Well I hope to bring this back to the forefront once again so you can finally own up to your mistakes, and show concrete steps being taken to remedy the situation. This blatant abuse of talent cannot go unpunished nor can it become the norm. It's time to finally own up and pay your players Team Secret.

I thought Team Secret was an organization created by the players, for the players? Everything Team Secret has done to this point is antithetical to that ideal. It's time this organization examine itself from top to bottom to analyze and figure out just why this team has failed to live up to that standard. The statement put out by the team just shows just how flawed and out of touch the organization really is with the gravity of the situation. This is a symptom of an even greater problem within the organization. 

Please Puppey, if you have any respect for the team you helped create two years ago, you will stop running from the problem, and make your team the organization you wanted it to be. You felt screwed over by Na'Vi, but now your team is starting to morph into something even worse. I know it's hard to be called out by ex-teammates, but the best thing you can do to show them any respect is to give them the decency of a simple acknowledgement of the problem. Show them the steps being taken to make any outstanding payments, and current players how payments are going to be distributed in the future. It is the least you could do. Running from the problem isn't going to fix anything, and it's only going to get worse the longer you refuse to acknowledge the problem. 

I've been a fan of Puppey since TI2, and Team Secret when it was formed after TI4. It pains me to see an organization I loved descend into "this". If you have it in your hearts to make it up to your players and fans, you will fix this problem, and you will provide a REAL response, not some bullshit statement to placate sponsors in a time of crisis.~|complaint esports
The Boston Major: A thank you to the community|self.DotA2|~Hello everyone,

After an incredible six day journey, The Boston Major has come to an end. We witnessed epic teamfights, outstanding solo plays, insane team coordinations and almost sacrificed ODPixel and our hearts on the altar of the 3rd game of the Grand Final.

Post-Manila, the expectations for the next Major were sky-high and the pressure to deliver higher than ever. There were some missteps along the way, but we learned a lot in the process and we're grateful for the support and feedback we have received during the event.

So thank you Boston for having us and thank you Valve for trusting us again.

We hope everyone enjoyed the show and we'll see you again in April 2017 in beautiful Kyiv (Kiev).~|shout esports
